<h1>Chapter 2: Confession from My Younger Sister&#8217;s Online Wife</h1>


<p>On that night, after breezing through my homework, I delved into my usual routine of studying.</p>



<p>The midterms were just two days away, and my efforts from this point would determine whether I&#8217;d secure a spot in the top ten of our grade.</p>



<p>My goal was to achieve a perfect score in my strong subject, Japanese history. If I could present a perfect answer sheet, it would solidify in Takase&#8217;s mind that &#8220;<em>Fujisaki Haruto is indeed smart.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>It might seem dubious to seek study help from someone of the opposite sex whose contact information they didn&#8217;t even possess, but well, Takase was friendly with guys too. There was a decent chance she would reach out to me regardless of gender.</p>



<p>At school, Takase was practically glued to the Momoi Group, leaving me with little chance to converse with her. In order to bridge that gap quickly, acing the test was the only way to go.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s give it my all!&#8221;</p>



<p>I sipped on the apple vinegar I had been using as a study companion lately and continued working through the problem sets.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haru-nii, are you awake?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was around 10pm when I heard Kotomi&#8217;s voice along with a knock.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m up.&#8221; I replied through the door, and she cautiously opened it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clad in an anime shirt and sweatpants, Kotomi seemed on the verge of tears for some reasons.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, well&#8230; I need your help.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is the homework difficult?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It is, but no, not about that&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Want me to accompany you to the convenience store?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit peckish, but no, that&#8217;s not it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is there a bug in your room?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No bug either&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi awkwardly averted her eyes and stumbled over her words. Although we rarely spoke at school, we chatted a lot at home. Even tonight, during dinner, we had a conversation like, &#8220;What anime is this BGM from?&#8221; and &#8220;They use this a lot in variety shows&#8221;.</p>



<p>However, Kotomi now wore a distressed expression while sending an uneasy gaze in my direction.</p>



<p>To be honest, I had a bad feeling about this. We had a similar exchange just last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be the case, but—</p>



<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t related to Mahorin, is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s related to Mahorin.”</p>



<p>“This is not another meetup, is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s about that.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Again? Does the word &#8216;reflection&#8217; not exist in your vocabulary?</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Why the heck did you agree?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-well, if I refuse, I might hurt Mahorin&#8217;s feelings&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And what about my mental well-being?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was like sending Kotomi to a group full of party animals. This thing shaves away your sanity.</p>



<p>&#8220;B-but I don&#8217;t want Mahorin to hate me&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Mahorin was her only friend. I wanted to keep a good impression, but&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you even care if I end up hating you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Haru-nii, you wouldn&#8217;t hate me, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi looked like she was about to cry.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh, don&#8217;t be such a crybaby. I won&#8217;t hate you, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Really?&#8221;</p>



<p>With her eyes downcast, Kotomi looked at me to seek assurance. I nodded.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not a siscon, but Kotomi is my precious sister. They said the more trouble a child was, the cuter they were. Kotomi fit that description for me.</p>



<p>Back in elementary school, she used to cling to me all the time. But as we approached the end of our first year in middle school, those who get close with the opposite sex started to stand out, and to avoid attention, Kotomi began avoiding me at school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, that didn&#8217;t mean her reliance on me disappeared. When exams were near, she&#8217;d come for study sessions, and if a shiny black bug ever appeared in her room, she&#8217;d dash straight to my room.</p>



<p>For me, it was only natural to be relied upon by Kotomi, and helping her was just a matter of course. Even if the offline meetup was a hassle, that didn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;d suddenly start hating her. I really thought my sister was adorable.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, is this offline meetup another collaboration cafe?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, this time it&#8217;s karaoke.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, karaoke.&#8221;</p>



<p>In that case, just singing should be fine. If Momoi invited her to karaoke, that meant she wanted to sing, not to talk about otaku stuff. While I was worried about keeping up with conversation during the collaboration cafe because of my lack of knowledge, with karaoke, the risk of being exposed would be greatly reduced.</p>



<p>Perhaps sensing that my expression had softened, Kotomi looked up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you like karaoke, Haru-nii?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s alright. I used to go with friends quite often in middle school. Though it&#8217;s been a while, I still go once every two or three months with them.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Which karaoke place do you go to? ManekiNeko? BigVoice?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really have a preference&#8230; Why do you ask?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I kind of mentioned I prefer ManekiNeko to Mahorin. It&#8217;d look weird if you didn&#8217;t have a membership card.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that. I&#8217;ve got a ManekiNeko member card.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi sighed in relief, &#8220;Phew. I&#8217;m glad Haru-nii likes karaoke.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad too. I won&#8217;t have to prepare like last time with karaoke.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Oh, but, Haru-nii, it&#8217;s not a big deal, but I told Mahorin that Jet Black likes obscure songs. Could you avoid famous ones?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Piece of cake. If anything, I&#8217;m more familiar with obscure songs.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Great! Also, they should only be anime songs.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Hold up! Don&#8217;t casually drop such a bomb!</em></p>



<p>&#8220;I only know a few anime songs, like from Driste!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Driste is too mainstream, you can&#8217;t sing that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I just lost my only weapon!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry! I&#8217;ll list up anime songs that perfectly fits your voice!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;When do I need to memorize these by?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>You wouldn&#8217;t say tomorrow after school, would you?</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Until Saturday at 1 PM.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Saturday, huh? I guess I can manage somehow&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Today was Wednesday. Just like last time, it was a last-minute job, but having a whole extra two days was a relief. With that much time, I should be able to memorize the songs. It could get confusing, but I could pull through if I just said I was tone-deaf.</p>



<p>&#8220;Also, I might&#8217;ve bragged to Mahorin about Jet Black being a great singer, so make sure to sing well, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you raising the bar like that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I thought if she knows I&#8217;m good at singing, she&#8217;d hesitate to go with me&#8230; Sorry, Haru-nii.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. What&#8217;s said is said. In that case, I&#8217;ll focus on memorizing two or three songs and let Mahorin sing the rest.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I told Mahorin, &#8216;<em>I don&#8217;t want to let go of the mic.&#8217;</em>&#8220;</p>



<p><em>She&#8217;s blocking every escape routes!</em></p>



<p>&#8220;If you get invited again, just switch to me in the middle of the chat, alright?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh, sorry for causing you trouble&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay now. If you understand, that&#8217;s enough.&#8221;</p>



<p>Crying or protesting wouldn&#8217;t change the inevitable event. No amount of lecturing would change the situation.</p>



<p>Besides, I had already accepted being the stand-in once. Momoi recognized &#8216;Jet Black Yasha = Fujisaki Haruto.&#8217;&nbsp; Either way, I had to go.</p>



<p>&#8220;Time is precious. Hurry up and list down the songs for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait. I&#8217;ll prepare them right away!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi left the room and returned after about thirty minutes. In her hands were a music player and a tablet—</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the tablet for?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You use it to watch anime.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Why anime?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because you can only sing anime songs. After singing, you will probably discuss the anime, so it&#8217;s good to have some knowledge. I created an account for you and added them to your playlist! They&#8217;re mostly unknown ones, but I guarantee they&#8217;re interesting!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;How many episodes in total?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fifty episodes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Looks like I&#8217;d be drowned in anime until the day of the offline meeting.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>And so, Saturday arrived. After I finished watching anime in the morning, I arrived at Kinjo Station five minutes before our meeting time.</p>



<p>The meetup spot, the &#8220;ManekiNeko,&#8221; was on the third floor of the same building we entered last time. I headed to the multipurpose building and took the elevator to the third floor. As the doors swung open, there was a blonde, blue-eyed girl in front of the karaoke place.</p>



<p>Momoi, in her off-shoulder knit dress, seemed to be having an argument with a&nbsp;college student. She was raising her voice with a face full of disgust.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you, I&#8217;m meeting someone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re free, right? I could take you somewhere more fun than karaoke.&#8221;</p>



<p>It seemed like she was being picked up persistently. Seeing a high school girl with blonde hair and blue eyes was rare, so for a confident pick-up artist, she must be an irresistible target.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m waiting for someone, I can&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s talk.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Geez, I can&#8217;t stand people like you! If you don&#8217;t stop—&#8221;</p>



<p>At that moment, Momoi noticed me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I thought about hiding in the elevator since interfering might lead to trouble, but once spotted, I couldn&#8217;t just stay silent.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you know him, Momoi?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, not at all. He&#8217;s just bothering me. Say something to him―&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;S-s-sorry! Excuse me! My apologies!&#8221;</p>



<p>He ran off before I could say anything. The elevator doors closed in front of me, and he hurriedly descended the stairs.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I was well aware that I looked intimidating, but seriously, he&#8217;s way too scared. I could get hurt too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s precisely why the kindness of Takase, who not only didn&#8217;t fear me but complimented me with a smile, stood out.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks for driving him away. I appreciate it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You did more than enough&#8230; Are you feeling down?&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi peered into my face, and I turned away with a dismissive gesture.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Lie. You&#8217;re definitely— Oh, I get it. You&#8217;re shocked because he was scared of you, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tease me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not teasing you. It&#8217;s good to have a tough face. Not my type, but there are definitely someone who like that kind of face.&#8221;</p>



<p>The &#8216;not my type&#8217; was unnecessary, but since I didn&#8217;t want Momoi to like me, I&#8217;d take that as a compliment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway, your outfit is amazing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, you noticed?”</p>



<p>Since we wouldn&#8217;t go to a collab café today, there wasn&#8217;t any specific dress code. I came here in casual attire.</p>



<p>The other day, I overheard Takase gushed about her animal fortune-telling, &#8220;<em>It says I&#8217;m compatible with a tiger type!&#8221;</em> That&#8217;s why I bought a tiger-patterned shirt and pants with tiger embroidery on the same day. I hoped Momoi would bring up &#8220;<em>I saw Fujisaki in a tiger outfit&#8221;</em> as a topic when she chatted with Takase.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2024/01/1000010215.png">



<p>&#8220;Nope. I didn&#8217;t notice. Whose cosplay is that supposed to be?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, cosplay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Otherwise, it&#8217;s just too tacky.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Too tacky, she says&#8230;? No way, isn&#8217;t it pretty cool? </em>Who would say tigers look uncool? If tigers were considered cool, then a tiger-patterned shirt and pants should also be considered cool.</p>



<p>Ah, I get it.</p>



<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t your cup of tea, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a general statement. The combination is just too tacky. If you had a cute face, the contrast might work, but on you, it just looks like you&#8217;re on the job.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was frustrating, but she&#8217;s got a point. Certainly, some people found tigers scary, and if that&#8217;s the case, tiger-patterned shirts and pants would seem intimidating.</p>



<p><em>Okay, so I look like I&#8217;m on the job, huh?</em> That&#8217;s probably why the guy fled earlier.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s good to know that it wasn&#8217;t because of my face, but if Momoi started a conversation like, &#8220;<em>I saw Fujisaki dressed so ugly,</em>&#8221; it would be the worst. Let&#8217;s bluff my way out.</p>



<p>&#8220;As you said, it&#8217;s cosplay. From a certain anime!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the title? I&#8217;ll look it up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better not to! It&#8217;s kind of, you know, pretty gruesome! Anyway, let&#8217;s check-in quickly!&#8221;</p>



<p>I pushed my way in and passed through the automatic door. The female clerk at the entrance grimaced upon seeing me enter like I was barging in. I should really stop wearing this outfit.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-welcome. A room for two?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, two people.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How long would you like to stay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, what do you think?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How about two hours?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just two hours?&#8221;</p>



<p>I thought we&#8217;d be here for a good chunk of time and enjoyed ourselves freely. Did she have other plans today? Well, for me, a shorter time was more convenient. I only memorized seven songs after all.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought we should finish early because of the upcoming exams. If you feel like belting out songs, I&#8217;ll accompany you for as many hours as you want.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nah, two hours is fine. These things tend to drag on in the end if they&#8217;re too long.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know, right? You end up cutting your original songs midway and adding unfamiliar ones. Eventually, it turns into just watching live performances towards the end.&#8221;</p>



<p>Judging by her tone, it seemed like she had experience in karaoke unlike Kotomi. I wonder if she went with her usual group. I&#8217;d love to know what kind of songs Takase liked.</p>



<p>&#8220;Two hours, please.&#8221;</p>



<p>After specifying the duration, we received our microphones and glasses, poured some cola from the drink bar, and then headed to our room. As we sat facing each other on the couch, Momoi handed me the touchpanel.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can sing as much as you like.&#8221;</p>



<p>Now, what to do?</p>



<p>I remembered four opening songs, two ending songs, and one insert song, making a total of seven songs. Even if we talked about the anime in between, it wouldn&#8217;t last more than an hour.</p>



<p>I planned to extend the time by repeating the same songs, but because Kotomi filled in three precious slots with songs that needed you to scream, my throat would die If I repeated them.</p>



<p>I came prepared for that because I thought there would be free time. If it was only two hours, I could keep the flow going while maintaining the image of an &#8216;otaku who loves obscure anime songs.&#8217; However—</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s sing together, Mahorin.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ideally, I wanted Momoi to join as well. That way, I could make it through in one hour without repeating any songs.</p>



<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say you don&#8217;t want to let go of the mic?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, but it&#8217;s my first time at karaoke with someone who loves anime songs. I want to enjoy the excitement together. That seems way more fun, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I get it. Honestly, I wanted to sing too. It&#8217;s my first time singing anime songs with someone else! Finally, I can get excited about anime songs&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi looked so happy that she couldn&#8217;t hide her emotions. If she wanted to sing, she should have just said so. Was Momoi also trying not to be disliked by her online gaming partner just like Kotomi?</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you not sing anime songs when you go with friends?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I only sing trendy songs then. I keep my otaku side a secret.&#8221;</p>



<p>She was pretty thorough. Even if someone had sung an anime song in front of me, I wouldn&#8217;t have noticed it. And even if I noticed, I wouldn&#8217;t think much of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe it took courage to be open about it, something I, who is not an otaku, couldn&#8217;t fully understand.</p>



<p>Anyway,</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s sing all the anime songs we want. And if possible, sing MioMio&#8217;s character song too.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Momoi had said that she loved all the characters. That&#8217;s why her singing MioMio&#8217;s song might lead to her wanting to sing everyone&#8217;s character songs. I should be able to keep up with the anime talk if it was about Driste.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to sing! Oh, speaking of MioMio-chan, thanks a bunch for the acrylic stand! It looks like this!&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi showed me a photo on her phone. Driste&#8217;s acrylics stands lined up in a case with lights, resembling a live concert venue.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s some serious dedication.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right? As you can see, the top row replicates the final episode&#8217;s live scene! The bottom row showcases the glamorous daily lives of the idols! And this photo here is my figure shelf! I arranged it to create a dream live venue with music-themed works! This shelf is exclusively for Miku-chan! And then ta-da! A collection of hot-blooded warrior princesses&#8230; oh, wait, that&#8217;s not it.&#8221;</p>



<p>This time it&#8217;s a grand assembly! Momoi, with her spirits high, swiped away the &#8216;that&#8217;s not it&#8217; photo. <em>Nooo, show me more!</em></p>



<p>It was brief, but wasn&#8217;t that Takase? She was proudly posing in casual clothes at a café with a coffee in hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Your eyes are sparkling. Was it that impressive?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fantastic! Thanks for showing me such cool stuff!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure, sure! If anything, figures are meant to be seen, right? Show me your figure collection too, Jet Black-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, um, I didn&#8217;t take any pictures.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Even when I travel, I don&#8217;t take photos; I just store memories in my heart. Anyway, let&#8217;s sing already!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; Momoi said with excited eyes.</p>



<p>While feeling a bit anxious about meeting her expectations, I operated the touch panel and grabbed the microphone.</p>



<p>The title of the song was displayed along with the intro. Momoi looked surprised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;What song is this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Cyber ​​Ninja War. Haven&#8217;t heard of it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my first time hearing it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s pretty niche.&#8221;</p>



<p>After saying that, I started singing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The beginning was reasonably easy, but the rap inserted in the middle was tricky. Why did Kotomi use a precious slot for rap? I wished she prioritized ease of singing over vocal quality.</p>



<p>When the song ended, I set the microphone down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;How was it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even though I heard it for the first time, it&#8217;s a great song. And that random rap in the middle is such an anime thing, right? Well, it&#8217;s my turn next! Let&#8217;s see, whose character song should I start with?&#8221;</p>



<p>Anime discussion? None! The six hours I spent on &#8220;Cyber Ninja Wars&#8221; evaporated in an instant.</p>



<p>It was the most interesting of all Kotomi&#8217;s choices, and there were many scenes I could talk about&#8230; I could initiate anime talk myself, but Momoi was already itching to sing.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided! Following your request, I&#8217;ll start with MioMio-chan!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeaaah! MioMio!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me and go all out with your otagei dance!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Otagei dance!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You said you&#8217;re the type to bust out otagei dance when you listen to anime songs, Jet Black-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>That&#8217;s news to me!?</em></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen otagei in real life, so this will be my first time ~&#8221; Momoi looked at me with eager anticipation.</p>



<p>I did know what otaku dance was from watching Driste, but I had never danced it myself. Nevertheless, according to Momoi, I was capable. Since I had been doing a flawless job as a stand-in so far, I didn&#8217;t want to stumble here.</p>



<p>When the intro played, Momoi gripped the microphone. The moment she started singing, I vigorously shook my hips and spun my arms at high speed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Pfft!&#8221;</p>



<p>Seeing me like this, Momoi burst into laughter. While coughing lightly, she grinned and began singing the character song. When the song ended, she couldn&#8217;t contain her laughter any longer and started laughing out loud while clutching her stomach.</p>



<img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2024/01/1000010221.png">



<p>&#8220;Wait, Jet Black-kun, you&#8217;re too hilarious!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;D-Don&#8217;t laugh so much!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Your moves are unexpectedly sharp&#8230; the contrast between your outfit and your dancing&#8230; hahaha.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apparently, it hit the spot. The memory seemed to be etched in her mind as she couldn&#8217;t stop laughing.</p>



<p>Wiping away tears from her blue eyes, she spoke again, &#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s so funny. You&#8217;re truly the best. Can I record a video? I won&#8217;t show it to anyone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No way, it&#8217;s embarrassing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aww, too bad. Okay then, Jet Black-kun, your turn next.”</p>



<p>Receiving the touch panel, I selected a song and grabbed the microphone. The intro began, likely from a lesser-known anime since Momoi seemed unfamiliar with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even after singing, the conversation didn&#8217;t steer towards anime. She eagerly picked a song, her face brimming with anticipation, and then I flawlessly performed my otaku dance. She almost burst into another laughter while singing the character song.</p>



<p>The call signal rang when both otaku dance and shouts had drained my energy. Momoi, who was sensing my fatigue, responded in my stead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;We have about ten more minutes. What do you want to do? Shall we extend?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It must have been incredibly fun for her to suggest an extension. If it were Kotomi, she might accept out of the fear of being disliked. However, I was confident I had entertained Momoi enough already. After all, it was Momoi who initially proposed the two-hour limit, so she wouldn&#8217;t mind wrapping it up here.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s call it a day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you feel like you haven&#8217;t sung enough, we can extend it by an hour or so&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No need.&#8221;</p>



<p>After informing the staff, Momoi sat on the sofa and directed a serious gaze at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Forgive me for the odd question, but&#8230; do you have a girlfriend?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why ask all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just answer.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>She sighed, seemingly relieved.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, how about going out with me?&#8221;</p>



<p>She dropped a bomb that left me bewildered.</p>



<p><em>Huh? Go out? Me with Momoi?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Does she like me? It&#8217;s nice to hear, but I couldn&#8217;t date her. I like Takase.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>But still&#8230; nonchalant as she might sound, confessing took a lot of courage. In the end, I couldn&#8217;t date her, but dismissing it with a blunt &#8220;no&#8221; would be too harsh. I needed to choose my words carefully to avoid hurting her feelings.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; this is a bit hard to say, but&#8230; uh—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s fine. I can tell without you saying anything,&#8221; Momoi interrupted me with a composed expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re surprisingly cool about it&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because I never intended to date you in the first place.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Wait, are you messing with me?”</p>



<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do something mean like that. I just wanted to confirm Fujisaki&#8217;s feelings.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My feelings?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wanted to know if you had a crush on me. I thought you might hesitate a bit, but I never expected you to be so uninterested. It&#8217;s surprising.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Should I be apologetic or proud?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can be proud. Thanks for not falling for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, to the main point. Can you pretend to be my boyfriend?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Don&#8217;t confuse me any further!</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Why the heck would I do that? It makes no sense.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry for confusing you. Let me explain. The reason I proposed the offline meetup was partly to hang out with you and also to ask if you&#8217;d pretend to be my boyfriend. Just to be clear, it&#8217;s strictly &#8216;pretending,&#8217; I planned to drop the idea if you showed any romantic interest &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you suggest it last time, then?&#8221;</p>



<p>Just like this time, I didn&#8217;t show any romantic interest to Momoi at the collaboration café. If anything, I wanted to escape as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wanted to observe a bit more. You weren&#8217;t overly friendly at school, declined extending the meetup, and even rejected my confession. Though the fact that we&#8217;re classmates is a bit of an issue, there&#8217;s no better candidate than you. So please, I&#8217;m begging you, pretend to be my boyfriend!&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Pretending to be in a relationship with the popular Momoi, huh?</em></p>



<p>Honestly, I wasn&#8217;t thrilled about it, but if I rejected this, she might look for another guy for the role and find a different in-game husband. I didn&#8217;t like Momoi in that way, but I didn&#8217;t dislike her either. After all, we had played together even if I was just a stand-in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If she met a new in-game husband at an offline meetup, and if that guy harbored impure thoughts towards Momoi—and if it&#8217;d somehow become a scandal—I would feel genuinely bad.</p>



<p>There was also Kotomi to consider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If things went well with a new in-game husband, Momoi probably sever her connection with Kotomi. Momoi was Kotomi&#8217;s only friend. I wanted to avoid the risk of losing that.</p>



<p>Though my answer has already been decided, I&#8217;d like to hear more details.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why pretend to be a couple?&#8221;</p>



<p>Did she want to avoid an arranged marriage? Or perhaps she wanted to participate in an event exclusively for couples? Or was this her strategy to ward off guys that tried to hit on her?</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to introduce you to my friends.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8230;I had a bad feeling about this. I hoped it was a misunderstanding, but lately, my bad feelings tend to be accurate.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are these friends&#8230; Kotobuki, Aoki, and Takase?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You catch on fast.&#8221;</p>



<p>Damn it, they&#8217;re a close-knit group! Kotobuki and Aoki were one thing, but pretending to be a couple in front of Takase? I had been crushing on her for a year and a month! I didn&#8217;t want Takase to think I was already taken!&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for Kotomi&#8217;s sake, I couldn&#8217;t refuse.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please. I promise it won&#8217;t cause any trouble for you, Fujisaki! Ran-chan, Aoi-chan, and Naru-chan are tight-lipped, so they won&#8217;t spread rumors at school. I just need you to act like my boyfriend for that one day when I introduce you to them!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if we pretend to be a couple for a day, won&#8217;t they assume we&#8217;re still together after we meet them?&#8221;</p>



<p>If anything, they&#8217;d expect that. Otherwise, there&#8217;s no point in introducing me.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I can&#8217;t say that we only pretend to be a couple, but I&#8217;ll let them know we break up soon after.&#8221;</p>



<p>“And what will be the reason for the breakup?”</p>



<p>&#8220;The reason? I haven&#8217;t thought that far&#8230; maybe because of a fight or differences in values.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Go with the latter. And if possible, make it seem like we broke up amicably.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi was Takase&#8217;s best friend. If she found out we broke up due to a fight, she might disliked me. Momoi was popular, so if we broke up because of differences in values, it should be understandable.</p>



<p>&#8220;That works. &#8230;So, will you do it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it, but why on earth do you need to pretend we&#8217;re a couple?&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi looked embarrassed, avoiding eye contact. Hesitatingly, she opened her mouth;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the only one without a boyfriend, I was worried about feeling left out, so I bluffed that I have a boyfriend.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Huh?”</p>



<p>&#8220;Seriously, I&#8217;m the only one without a boyfriend! Wouldn&#8217;t you also get antsy if all your close friends suddenly got into relationships? Wouldn&#8217;t you be worried that they might start avoiding you to hang out with their lovers?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Let me get this straight. Are you saying you&#8217;re the only one without a boyfriend?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you mocking me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not. The way you put it makes it sound like the other three already have boyfriends&#8230; Haha, as if that&#8217;d happen.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re having this conversation in the first place. Besides, they&#8217;re all incredibly cute. It&#8217;s only natural they have boyfriends.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Cute! Definitely cute! The kind of cuteness that naturally comes with having a boyfriend!</em></p>



<p>But Takase didn&#8217;t, right? She obviously didn&#8217;t have one! Did you know how much I had observed her? I had never seen her acting lovey-dovey with a guy at school!</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, who are the boyfriends of the other three? What are they like? Since when have they been dating?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;About two months&#8230; since spring break. I only know they&#8217;re not from school.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And you haven&#8217;t even seen a photo of their boyfriends?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nope. They&#8217;re considerate enough not to flaunt their love lives in front of a single person like me. That&#8217;s why I just said I have a boyfriend. Then everyone started asking questions.&#8221;</p>



<p>They were already close friends, and on top of that, Momoi was the most popular girl at school. It was natural for them to be curious about who Momoi was dating.</p>



<p>&#8220;At first, I managed with a made-up story&#8230; But the other day, Ran-chan suggested, &#8216;<em>Let&#8217;s introduce our boyfriends to each other.&#8217; </em>Everyone got excited about it, and I couldn&#8217;t keep up the act anymore. That&#8217;s why I suggested having an offline meeting.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Introduce them!? Doesn&#8217;t that make you nervous?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What about you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not at all! In fact, I&#8217;d prefer if it happen as soon as possible!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How about tomorrow?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s totally fine!&#8221;</p>



<p><em>There&#8217;s hope!</em> Watching Takase with her boyfriend would be a painful, but this was my last chance. Showing their boyfriends to each other meant we&#8217;d be compared. If I could show that I was the better guy, perhaps Takase would be swayed!&nbsp;</p>



<p>It had only been two months since they started dating; their feelings shouldn&#8217;t be that deep yet. Compared to some guy she couldn&#8217;t easily meet outside of school, there was good chance she would choose the guy sitting next to her!</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make sure to play the part of your boyfriend properly! In return, I&#8217;ve got a favor to ask.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already asked you to do something very difficult, so go ahead and tell me. No need to hold back.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Turn me into a handsome guy!&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi looked surprised.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re worried about your looks? Fujisaki, you&#8217;re not bad-looking at all. You&#8217;ve got a bit of a delinquent vibe, but your features are good. I&#8217;d say you fall into the cool category.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m talking about my clothes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, the clothes. Sure, leave it to me!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks a lot!&#8221;</p>



<p>With fashionable Momoi by my side, I was confident she could transform me into a cool guy. I hoped to be reborn as someone even Takase couldn&#8217;t resist falling for!</p>



<p>Carrying these expectations in my heart, we left the karaoke place.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>The place Momoi brought me to for this fashionable makeover was a clothing store located beside the complex facility in Kinjo Town. Its exterior looked like it had been directly transplanted from overseas, giving off the vibe of a store that exclusively dealt with trendy clothing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you come here often?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Occasionally. I can vouch for the quality.&#8221;</p>



<p>I entered the store with Momoi with a bit of nervousness. The atmosphere inside exuded a sense of luxury. I&#8217;d feel out of place on my own, but with the sophisticated Momoi by my side, I felt reassured.</p>



<p>&#8220;To get an idea, can you share your clothing preferences?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any in particular.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Am I free to pick anything?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. I asked you with that in mind. I trust your fashion sense, so go ahead and find something that suits me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it. Follow me.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I walked alongside Momoi, she picked up a brown cardigan.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just stay still.”</p>



<p>Momoi draped the cardigan over me, contemplating my face and the garment alternately with a pensive expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; something&#8217;s not quite right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re worried about looking scary, I wanted to give you a gentle impression. However&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you do that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can, but perhaps cardigan isn&#8217;t the best choice. It just doesn&#8217;t suit you at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is there a guy in this world who doesn&#8217;t look good in a cardigan?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There is, right in front of me. The cardigan should have given you a soft vibe, but it just turned out like a badly photoshopped image.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Badly photoshopped?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Could you choose a gentler way to put that?</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s try another outfit.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi returned the cardigan and continued to browse through clothes. This time, she picked up a beige-colored shirt. After placing it on me once again, she nodded in satisfaction.</p>



<p>&#8220;This should look better.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad it looks better, but I already have shirts.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What colors?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Navy, camouflage pattern, Hawaiian shirts, and, just for fun, tiger pattern. Is that no good?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it won&#8217;t do. Since I want to create a gentle impression, beige gives off a softer look. Let&#8217;s go with this one. Just to be sure, try putting it on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure thing. How do I look now? Do I give off a soft vibe?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You look nice.&#8221;</p>



<p>With Momoi&#8217;s seal of approval, I searched for a mirror. After checking my appearance, I somehow felt that my stern expression had softened. I couldn&#8217;t say for sure, but if Momoi said I looked nice, I probably did.</p>



<p>Now, the only concern was the price. It would be great if it was reasonably priced&#8230;</p>



<p>I took off the shirt to check the price tag.</p>



<p>&#8220;Momoi, this is bad.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s bad?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This shirt is expensive. It&#8217;s fifteen thousand yen!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not particularly bad, is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Truly the words of a rich girl. Our values were just too different. Even if you totaled the cost of the shirts I mentioned earlier, it wouldn&#8217;t match the price of this single shirt. Besides, beige wasn&#8217;t even my preferred color.</p>



<p>Well, I&#8217;d still buy it. Momoi went through the trouble of picking it out for me, after all.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to withdraw some money at the convenience store. You kill some time here for a bit.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No need to worry about money. I&#8217;ll cover it.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Huh, is she treating me?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why? Well, it&#8217;s obviously a thank-you for agreeing to my request.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You already did by helping me pick out the clothes. I never intended to have you treat me.&#8221;</p>



<p>While it was acceptable to treat or be treated to lunch among friends, my relationship with Momoi was somewhere between acquaintances and friends. Making her spend over 10,000 yen was a bit too much.</p>



<p>&#8220;Having a good sense of money is a positive trait, but you should accept goodwill gracefully.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even so, making you spend a fortune&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t overthink it. Besides, think about it. You&#8217;re going to be in a fake relationship with someone you don&#8217;t even like. If the roles were reversed, could you ask for such a favor for free? It&#8217;s only fair to show my appreciation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi was determined. If it could ease her guilt towards me, I might as well accept it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, thanks. I&#8217;ll really take good care of the clothes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s settled. Now, let&#8217;s move on to pants.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, pants? Are we taking this &#8216;pretend couple&#8217; thing that far?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi, who was looking bewildered, suddenly widened her eyes. Her snow-white skin turned a shade of red.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yo-you idiot! There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d show underwear to someone like you! When I said &#8216;pants<sup data-fn="f9c0f4df-b51c-41bf-a5b7-2a134ca12693" class="fn"><a href="#f9c0f4df-b51c-41bf-a5b7-2a134ca12693" id="f9c0f4df-b51c-41bf-a5b7-2a134ca12693-link">1</a></sup>,&#8217; I meant trousers!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you say that from the beginning?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have to spell it out! &#8216;Pants&#8217; clearly means trousers!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Pants are pants. What do you call underwear then?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shorts! From today on, you call them shorts too!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t! I&#8217;ll stick with pants for life!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fine, suit yourself.”</p>



<p>Turning her head away with a huff, Momoi strode ahead. I followed her, and in silence, we browsed through the trousers section.</p>



<p>Whether out of a strong sense of responsibility or sheer anger, Momoi didn&#8217;t seem to be cutting corners on choosing clothes. She scrutinized the trousers with a serious gaze and picked up a trousers pair.</p>



<p>&#8220;I already have black trousers.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are those tapered pants?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just regular trousers.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Regular&#8230; How&#8217;s the fit?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kind of snug, I guess.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then skinny pants it is.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, so that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re called. How are they different from tapered trousers?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Skinny pants are slim overall, while tapered pants are narrow in specific areas. Skinny pants may look more fashionable, but considering your sturdy build, I&#8217;d recommend tapered ones.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I do have some loose trousers.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wide-leg pants? While they&#8217;re trendy, they can look sloppy if you&#8217;re not used to them. Let&#8217;s go with tapered pants this time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it. Tapered trousers it is.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake, just say pants!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the one who told me to do whatever!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d give in at some point! Normally, you&#8217;d be more accommodating. You&#8217;re totally different in real life and online.&#8221;</p>



<p>Uh-oh. Did I get too casual?</p>



<p>I hadn&#8217;t seen the chat logs, so I didn&#8217;t know how they usually interacted. I only reluctantly agreed to the offline meetup. Kotomi must have treated Mahorin delicately to avoid hurting her feelings. They had never argued like this before.</p>



<p>I hoped she didn&#8217;t suspect I was just a stand-in&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry. I went too far.&#8221;</p>



<p>I immediately apologized, and Momoi looked apologetic as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not blaming you&#8230; I said that earlier, but online is online, and real life is real life. You don&#8217;t have to force yourself to act the same way as in the game.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really? You&#8217;re not going to say we should get a divorce or something?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t. Chatting with you is genuinely fun. And Fujisaki, you&#8217;re not getting tired of me, are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her blue eyes trembled with anxiety. Just like Kotomi valued Mahorin, Momoi seemed to treasure her friendship with Jet Black Yasha greatly.</p>



<p>Thinking that Kotomi had made such a good friend, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel proud as her older brother.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d get tired of you. Regardless of how our real-life relationship turns out, we&#8217;ll always be close in the online game.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, that sounds good.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi nodded happily and urged me to try on the trousers. After confirming they fit in the dressing room, I returned to Momoi.</p>



<p>&#8220;How is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It feels good.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Great. Next, let&#8217;s pick some accessories for your arms.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Accessories too? I&#8217;ll be wearing long-sleeve, won&#8217;t they be hidden?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can roll up the sleeves.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why not just go with short sleeves then?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was already late May, and with the rising temperatures, long sleeves could be uncomfortable. Plus, there was a beige short-sleeve shirt. Wouldn&#8217;t that be more practical for summer?</p>



<p>&#8220;Rolled-up sleeves gives you a robust impression. A gentle appearance but with strong-looking arms creates a nice contrast. That gap adds to the appeal.&#8221;</p>



<p>If Momoi said so, maybe I&#8217;d stick with the long-sleeved shirt.</p>



<p>&#8220;But you know, I&#8217;ve never really worn accessories. I feel like I&#8217;d come off as showy or something.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not necessarily. If it&#8217;s not overly flashy or jingly-jangly, it can look stylish. Don&#8217;t worry. you can go for something simple like a wristwatch.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I only have a wall clock.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;As a high schooler, you should have at least one. Here, I&#8217;ll give you mine.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi took off her white wristwatch without hesitation.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t have to give it to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The watch is unisex, so it won&#8217;t look weird on you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s probably expensive, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not really. It&#8217;s less than 20,000 yen.”</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still quite pricey&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No need to hold back. Here, put this on. You know how to put it on, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can figure that out.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I put on the white wristwatch, my wrist gradually became warm, probably because of Momoi&#8217;s body heat.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks. I&#8217;ll really take good care of it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You better. Alright, let&#8217;s head to the cashier.&#8221;</p>



<p>We walked together towards the counter, where Momoi smoothly handled the payment with electronic money. I received the paper bag and left the store.</p>



<p>&#8220;Seriously, thanks a lot. With this, I might actually become a cool guy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome. Well, I&#8217;ve done what I could, so I&#8217;ll be heading back soon&#8230; By the way, you remember the meeting time for tomorrow, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, 1:30 at Koigishi Station, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>The club activities were on break for exams starting today. On our way to the clothing store, Momoi sent a group message about tomorrow&#8217;s plan and she quickly got replies from the other two.</p>



<p>The meeting place for tomorrow was at the Kotobuki residence. Apparently, her family was out so we could go there without disturbing anyone.</p>



<p>Even though I went to the same middle school as Kotobuki, I didn&#8217;t know where her house was, so Momoi would guide me. I had already exchanged contact information with Momoi just to be safe, though it might be unnecessary.</p>



<p>&#8220;Make sure to wear the new clothes you bought today, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. I&#8217;ll play the perfect boyfriend.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m counting on you. And, um, I wanted to change how we address each other.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi hesitated as she spoke.</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it fine to keep calling each other &#8216;Fujisaki&#8217; and &#8216;Momoi&#8217; like before?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Some couples use last names, but I&#8217;ve told them that we&#8217;re calling each other by our first names.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s fine then.&#8221;</p>



<p>While calling each other by last names was okay, addressing each other by first names felt more like a couple. If I ever dated Takase, I planned to call her Narumi too.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright&#8230; can I give it a try?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, go ahead. Practice as much as you want right now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi called my name, a hint of embarrassment in her voice. It was the first time a girl had casually called me by my name. Seeing her blushing and looking a bit shy, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a bit embarrassed myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Your turn, Haruto-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it. Should I call you Maho-chan?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Honey.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why do I get the foreign-style name?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m from England. It&#8217;s not uncommon for couples there to call each other &#8216;Darling&#8217; or &#8216;Honey.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t call me Darling!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a reason for that. When Naru-chan and the others asked how we address each other, I said &#8216;Honey.&#8217; Then they asked what you call me, and when I thought about it, calling each other &#8216;Darling&#8217; and &#8216;Honey&#8217; in Japan felt a bit cheesy. So, I quickly switched to using names.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shove the cheesiness onto just me!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get upset&#8230; Besides, surprisingly, it got a good reaction. Naru-chan was like, &#8216;I&#8217;m jealous!&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fine, I&#8217;ll go with Honey.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quick to accept.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a flexible guy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yet you didn&#8217;t change &#8216;trousers&#8217;!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a whole different story.&#8221;</p>



<p>As long as I could win Takase&#8217;s heart, I didn&#8217;t care what others think. I&#8217;d call Momoi &#8216;Honey&#8217; a lot and make Takase jealous.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then, see you tomorrow, Honey.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, see you, Haruto-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>I parted ways with Momoi and headed to Kinjo Station, carrying a trendy paper bag in hand.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>The next day, I visited Koigishi Station, which bustled with the typical weekend crowd, and easily spotted Momoi without much effort. Her golden hair and azure eyes made her stand out even in the bustling crowd.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry for the wait.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I just got here. You&#8217;re wearing the clothes we bought yesterday.&#8221;</p>



<p>Whether it was because she chose the outfit herself or another reason, Momoi looked somewhat proud.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. You picked them out for me, Honey.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re already getting into character. Isn&#8217;t calling me &#8216;Honey&#8217; embarrassing?&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps she was feeling sorry for forcing the &#8216;Honey&#8217; nickname. She used to strike me as a cold girl, but she earnestly helped me choose clothes yesterday. She&#8217;s a surprisingly kind person.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not embarrassing at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>I heard Takase was jealous of the &#8216;Honey&#8217; nickname. Once my one-sided crush was fullfiled, I&#8217;d call Takase &#8216;Honey&#8217; too. If I thought of it as a rehearsal for that moment, any embarrassment flew out the window.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a strong mental game. Aren&#8217;t you worried about pretending to be lovers too?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No worries. I just gotta act like I&#8217;m madly in love with you, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;True. Since the setting is that I&#8217;m loved too much by my boyfriend, I&#8217;ll allow you to do something like stroking my hair to make it seem that way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it. Well, shall we head out? Is Kotobuki&#8217;s house close?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s behind the station.&#8221;</p>



<p>Following Momoi&#8217;s lead, we made our way to a cozy café tucked away behind the station. Judging by the exterior, the first floor was used as a shop, and the second floor was a residence.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, this place is Kotobuki&#8217;s house?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Have you been here before?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I was curious, but I&#8217;ve only passed by a couple of times.&#8221;</p>



<p>My mother often used this place for the get-together after the volleyball matches, and she always brought back coffee beans as souvenirs.</p>



<p>Even when brewed by an amateur, it was delicious. I&#8217;d like to taste some coffee made by professional. The windows and door were covered with curtains, and the &#8216;Closed&#8217; sign was hung.</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re off today. It&#8217;s unusual for a Sunday.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sunday are their regular day off. Her parents apparently cherish their family time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi, as she spoke, seemed somewhat envious. I wonder if her parents weren&#8217;t the type to value family time. Well, it was none of my business.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you ready for this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always ready.&#8221;</p>



<p>Though the sign said &#8216;Closed&#8217; to prevent customers from accidentally entering, the door was unlocked. Momoi opened the door and we stepped inside.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, here you are!&#8221;</p>



<p>A girl in an apron greeted us.</p>



<p>She was Kotobuki Ran. We went to the same middle school, and she was in my class last year. However, all I knew about her that she was in the volleyball club. Being around 180 centimeters tall, she was pretty tall for a girl, so I assumed she did quite well in the club.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting for you, Maho&#8230; Wait, isn&#8217;t that Fujisaki?!&#8221;</p>



<p>When spotting me, Kotobuki squinted apologetically.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. We&#8217;re closed today. We&#8217;re open every day except Sundays, so come by then.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite entering the café with Momoi, Kotobuki probably thought I came in by mistake. That meant she didn&#8217;t see me and Momoi as a couple. I bet she&#8217;d be surprised to hear we were dating.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not here for coffee.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, is it just for fun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nope. I&#8217;m her boyfriend.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotobuki widened her eyes in shock.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, whaaat!? Boyfriend?? Fujisaki?!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Isn&#8217;t that right, Honey?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, Haruto-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi approached me, and I casually ran my fingers through her blond hair. Man, her hair felt amazing. It was unbelievably soft to the touch.</p>



<p>&#8220;Whoa! For real!? You two are dating!? I had no idea!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We kept it under wraps.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re way too good at hiding it! I never would&#8217;ve guessed it was Fujisaki of all people! I thought your mysterious lover was a working adult since you never mentioned his age!”</p>



<p>&#8220;Congratulations on your relationship.&#8221;</p>



<p>A soft voice accompanied by the click of a camera echoed.</p>



<p>In the sunlit corner, there was Aoki Aoi with a camera in hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She was a cool type. We were in the same class last year, but I rarely saw her speak. I didn&#8217;t know much about her, like why she preferred a camera over a smartphone, or if photography was her hobby. According to Momoi, her friends were tight-lipped, but&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t ask you to delete it, but don&#8217;t show the photo to anyone, okay? I want to keep things with Honey private.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t show it. I just enjoy taking photos.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Well, that&#8217;s fine then. By the way, Aoki, are you in the photography club?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s just a casual group. If you ever want to join, you&#8217;re welcome. We&#8217;ll even cover your fees once our circle upgrades to a club.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t plan to join, but if I feel like it, I&#8217;ll help you find members.&#8221;</p>



<p>Specifically, I was thinking of Kotomi. She was hopeless at both sports or academics, but she could handle a camera to some extent. Given Aoki&#8217;s easygoing nature, Kotomi might find it easy to interact with her.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good person.&#8221;</p>



<p>And she was easy to please. Would joining the circle enough to be recognized as a friend instantly? I&#8217;d suggest it to Kotomi later.</p>



<p>Leaving that aside, now that I had met these two, where was Takase? And what about Kotobuki and Aoki&#8217;s boyfriends?</p>



<p>&#8220;When are the rest coming?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They should be here soon. Fujisaki, are you a coffee person?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I like coffee.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nice! Then pick your favorite beans. It&#8217;s in the house.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really? Thanks!&#8221;</p>



<p>I was genuinely happy. I immediately checked the coffee beans on display for the first time, feeling a subtle thrill.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is orange juice okay for you, Maho?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Why don’t you get some coffee too, Honey?”</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a fan of coffee.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was about to ask her if that was the case, but Kotobuki grumbled.</p>



<p>&#8220;Listen, Fujisaki. Although we hang out at my place all the time, Maho, Aoi, and Narumi can&#8217;t handle coffee. Narumi attempted it the other day, but she quickly gave up and ended up adding a lot of sugar &#8230;Huh? By the way, how come you didn&#8217;t know Maho doesn&#8217;t like coffee even though you&#8217;re dating?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Oh no, did I just dig myself into a hole?</em></p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like that! I just never mentioned it. I didn&#8217;t want Haruto-kun knows I have things I&#8217;m bad at&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Nice save! Well done, Momoi!</em></p>



<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t mind! Having something you&#8217;re not good at makes you even cuter!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks, Haruto-kun! I love you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you too, Honey!&#8221;</p>



<p>I gently stroked Momoi&#8217;s hair as she leaned in. Seeing us like this, Kotobuki smirked, and Aoki snapped a photo.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to keep you waiting!&#8221;</p>



<p>After I ordered Kilimanjaro and sat down with Momoi at Aoki&#8217;s table, I heard a cute voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Phew, it&#8217;s so hot today! I&#8217;m sweating like crazy! Ran-chan, can I get orange jui—Oh, Fujisaki-kun! What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>



<p>Takase looked surprised.</p>



<img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2024/01/1000010243.png">



<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun is my boyfriend, that&#8217;s why.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, really!? Fujisaki-kun is Maho-chi&#8217;s boyfriend!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m Honey&#8217;s boyfriend.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Whoa, you really call her Honey! That&#8217;s so cool! It&#8217;s like a drama, I&#8217;m so envious!&#8221;</p>



<p>Takase sat down next to me while talking excitedly.</p>



<p><em>She smells amazing! </em>Also, Takase in casual clothes looked seriously cute. I&#8217;d love to have a picture of her in a pure white dress with a denim jacket.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I see. So Fujisaki-kun is Maho-chi&#8217;s boyfriend. I had no idea. You two hardly talk at school, after all. It&#8217;s surprising that you guys are kissing!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about us; feel free to kiss as much as you want!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;As much as I adore Honey, doing it in public is a bit much.”</p>



<p>Takase and the others looked bewildered.</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? I heard you guys kiss even in public, though?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>What? I haven&#8217;t heard anything like that. </em>Surely, we&#8217;re not about to start kissing here, right?</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, absolutely. Haruto-kun doesn&#8217;t hesitate to kiss me in front of everyone. Well, when we do it in public, it&#8217;s just a peck on the cheek! Go on, give me one like usual!&#8221;</p>



<p>Wait, seriously? While a kiss here would add credibility to our relationship, who&#8217;d go this far just for show?</p>



<p>&#8220;On the cheek, remember. Don&#8217;t slip up and aim for the lips, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If Honey says so&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>With everyone eagerly watching, I planted a kiss on Momoi&#8217;s snow-white cheek. Her skin was incredibly soft. Her hair, her skin—she almost didn&#8217;t feel like human.</p>



<p>When I pulled away, Momoi&#8217;s face turned bright red.</p>



<p>Clearly, it was her first-kiss reaction, but none of the three seemed suspicious. Takase&#8217;s eyes sparkled with interest, Kotobuki blushed slightly while pressing her cheek with her hand, and Aoki snapped another photo.</p>



<p>It looked like they really believe in our relationship. This way, even if we didn&#8217;t interact much at school, they&#8217;d think we shared kisses behind the scenes. All that&#8217;s left was to find the right moment and use our differing values as a reason to break up.</p>



<p>Of course, it would be Momoi who initiated the breakup. Once it was clear she had no lingering feelings, Takase wouldn&#8217;t feel guilty about dating me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Seeing you two be so sweet made me crave something sweet. Ran-chan, how about bringing <em>that</em> out?&#8221;</p>



<p>Prompted by Takase, Kotobuki disappeared behind the counter. After a short while, a whole cake was brought to our table.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is someone having a birthday?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nope. It&#8217;s a celebration cake because Maho-chan got a boyfriend!&#8221;</p>



<p>Looking closely, the cake plate read, &#8216;Congratulations, Maho-chan!&#8217; <em>That&#8217;s odd, isn&#8217;t it?</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Why is it just for &#8216;Honey&#8217;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, isn&#8217;t this a celebration for all three of us?&#8221;</p>



<p>At our inquiry, the three of them exchanged glances.</p>



<p>And then, Takase furrowed her brows apologetically.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, about that. Me having a boyfriend&#8230; that was a lie.&#8221;</p>



<p>Wait, seriously?</p>



<p>&#8220;Takase doesn&#8217;t have a boyfriend!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. To be honest, I&#8217;ve never had one. I&#8217;m sorry for lying.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine, I don&#8217;t mind at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Takase probably just wanted to save face like Momoi. <em>Phew, Takase was still free!!</em></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry, Maho-chi.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No need to apologize. I&#8217;m not bothered by it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps because Momoi was also deceiving Takase, she didn&#8217;t seem intend to blame her.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, when are Ran-chan and Aoi-chan&#8217;s boyfriends coming?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, about that. That was a lie too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, a lie? Ran-chan also doesn&#8217;t have a boyfriend?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Neither do I.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aoi-chan neither!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Now Momoi looked really bewildered.</p>



<p>Well, no wonder. It was supposed to be a gathering to introduce their boyfriends, but none of them actually had one. This plan was a complete failure.</p>



<p>Even so, despite this shocking revelation, neither Takase, Kotobuki, nor Aoki looked surprised at all. They were acting like they had known from the beginning.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute&#8230; Did you three know that none of you have boyfriends?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We knew, or rather, we coordinated this. If we pretend to have boyfriends, Maho won&#8217;t feel the need to hold back with us.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Me&#8230; hold back?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Maho, remember when we were in first year? When someone asked if you&#8217;d ever get a boyfriend, you said, <em>&#8216;I&#8217;d love to have one, but for now, I want to cherish the time spent with my friends&#8217;.</em> That&#8217;s why we decided to pretend to have boyfriends.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then we were shocked! Maho-chi really has a boyfriend!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You were so considerate of us that you pretended you didn&#8217;t have a boyfriend.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;From now on, you don&#8217;t have to hold back with us. Sure, it might be lonely if you&#8217;re always with your boyfriend, but Maho, you&#8217;re our precious friend. You can prioritize the time you spend with your boyfriend instead with us.&#8221;</p>



<p>In other words, the three of them thought, &#8220;<em>If we have boyfriends, Momoi can freely get one too,</em>&#8221; and pretended to have ones. I see, I see…</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Can we talk, Honey?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was actually thinking the same thing, Haruto-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>It seemed like we were on the same page. After informing Takase and the others that we&#8217;re going outside for a kiss, we stepped out.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s going on? I have no idea.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Me neither. If I knew, I wouldn&#8217;t have asked you to pretend to be my boyfriend.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a mess now. What do we do? Everyone there is single. We don&#8217;t need to pretend anymore.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi pretended to have a boyfriend because she didn&#8217;t want to feel left out. Now, with everyone supposedly single, there was no need to keep up the act.</p>



<p>&#8220;But can we just confess now? In that celebratory atmosphere, can you say, &#8216;<em>Actually, we were just pretending to be a couple</em>&#8216;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It might turn the atmosphere into a funeral, but you have to tough it out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the one to tell them&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Don&#8217;t give me that reluctant look. You sowed the seeds yourself.</em></p>



<p>&#8220;I get that it&#8217;s hard to bring it up, but it&#8217;s better to come clean sooner rather than later. That way, the impact will be less severe.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But how do I explain this? And remember, I can&#8217;t mention the offline meetup. It&#8217;s a secret that we&#8217;re otaku.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then just say, &#8216;<em>I asked him because he seems kind.&#8217;</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright&#8230; It was kind of a mess I created, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. Good luck.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>With the plan sorted, we returned to the shop. They had just cut the cake. On Momoi&#8217;s cake, there was a plate that read, &#8216;Congratulations Maho-chan&#8217;.</p>



<p>Despite her awkward expression, Momoi started to speak.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, well—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right! Let me give you this now!&#8221;</p>



<p>Interrupting Momoi, Takase took a wrapped box from her bag.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Open it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi hesitantly unwrapped the package to find bath salts inside.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-why bath salts?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a celebration! Our best friend got a boyfriend! I splurged and got this just for you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I see. Thanks. But actually—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be gifting a photo album.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even Aoi-chan&#8230; Wow, this is massive.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It can hold up to 600 photos. I&#8217;d love for you to capture many memories with him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-Thanks, but, you see—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And from me, it&#8217;s a tea set!&#8221;</p>



<p>They must had coordinated this. Amidst the flowing stream of congratulations, you could hear the sound of a heart breaking. Momoi looked like she was about to cry as the difficulty of broaching the subject increased.</p>



<p>Kotobuki and the others looked at Momoi&#8217;s face with worry.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;You don&#8217;t seem too happy. We tried to choose something you&#8217;d like&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t like the rose-scented bath salts?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re more into digital photos&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>Seeing the concern looks from her friends, Momoi hurriedly shook her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no! It&#8217;s not like that at all! My best friends put their hearts into choosing these gifts for me. I&#8217;m happy, really! I might even cry!&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi had succumbed to the celebratory mood. While I wanted her to hold strong, I couldn&#8217;t complain since I understood her feelings.</p>



<p><em>Well, now it&#8217;s up to me to say&#8230;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, it&#8217;s great that Maho-chi&#8217;s boyfriend is Fujisaki-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, Fujisaki-kun is reliable.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Plus, he has a sister, so he won&#8217;t have any weird fantasies about girls. I&#8217;ve known him since middle school, and despite his appearance, he&#8217;s not the type to make girls cry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think Fujisaki can protect Maho.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. You can trust Fujisaki-kun with Maho-chi! Make sure to make my best friend happy, alright?&#8221;</p>



<p>Now, I was the one who couldn&#8217;t say anything. I had confidence in my mental strength, but I didn&#8217;t have the courage to shatter this celebratory mood.</p>



<p>In that case, I had to stick to the original plan. Since I knew Takase didn&#8217;t have a boyfriend now, there was no need to rush to make myself single.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what I convinced myself while sipping Kilimanjaro coffee.</p>
