<h2>Final Interlude: Online Gaming Coupleâ€™s Chat Log</h2>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> So, the anime I&#8217;m most looking forward to next season has to be<em> &#8220;The Bare-Chested Returnee&#8221;</em></p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Exactly! I thought you would definitely like it when I watched the PV! You do love those isekai anime!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Absolutely! And it&#8217;s directed by Takeoka, no less! This is practically a guaranteed masterpiece!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Takeoka always twists the story around. It&#8217;s like a setup, development, twist, twist, twist, and resolution!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Call it the Takeoka rollercoaster! Remember how the story swung wildly in <em>&#8220;Me vs. Myself&#8221;</em>? His works always have such dramatic shifts!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Right! Especially the intense developments in the last two episodes! I never expected that ending when I was watching the first half!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> We had quite a few speculations, didn&#8217;t we?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> And we both got them completely wrong lol</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Predicting that ending was impossible lol</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Anyway, I&#8217;ll make sure to check out <em>&#8220;The Bare-Chested Returnee&#8221;</em>!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> What&#8217;s your top pick for next season, Mahorin?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> It&#8217;s &#8216;<em>My Second time in The Heian period!&#8217;</em></p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Ah, the one you mentioned before?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Yep! I was worried because there was no news for over a year after the anime adaptation was announced. Thought the project might have been scrapped.</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Didn&#8217;t the original have around 26 volumes out?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Volume 27 is coming out next month! It&#8217;s incredibly captivating, so I highly recommend it!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> I&#8217;ll grab the first three volumes for now!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> It&#8217;s a bit awkward if you stop at three, better go for four to reach a good stopping point!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Got it! Well, I think it&#8217;s time to call it a night.</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Oh, wait a sec!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>What&#8217;s up? Still itching to chat more?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Just a bit. Jet Black-kun, do you remember the talk about <em>&#8220;Passionate Warrior Princess&#8221;</em> art exhibition?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Of course! It&#8217;s finally opening the day after tomorrow! Kotomi was super excited about it and said she&#8217;s planning to go on the first day!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Right after it opens!?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>She&#8217;s really pumped up lol</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> You&#8217;ve got to move fast to get the entry perks!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>And the merchandise! Seriously, every item is god-tier!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Especially that <em>&#8220;Everyone Together&#8221;</em> tapestry. You must really want that, Jet Black-kun!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> It&#8217;s a given lol</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>So, Jet Black-kun, you&#8217;re coming too, right?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Heeey?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Jet Black-kun?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Oh, sorry. Are you asking if I&#8217;m going to this art exhibition too?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Well, yeah. Why did you think you wouldn&#8217;t?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> I just assumed you and Kotomi were going together.</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Why would you think that?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> I figured it would be more fun for girls alone. That means you wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about me, right? Not that I wouldn&#8217;t appreciate you being considerate, and I really do, but I don&#8217;t want to steal your enjoyment. I mean, I&#8217;m super interested in the exhibition, but my ideal scenario is for you to have fun, Mahorin.</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Don&#8217;t worry! I won&#8217;t leave you out, Jet Black-kun!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Huh, really? I&#8217;m not being left out? I thought from now on, you and Kotomi would enjoy your otaku activities together. I&#8217;m genuinely surprised if it&#8217;s not like that!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Let&#8217;s continue enjoying otaku activities together, the three of us!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Absolutely!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>I&#8217;m looking forward to the exhibition the day after tomorrow! We&#8217;re meeting at Koigi Station at 8:00, so don&#8217;t be late!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>I&#8217;ll do my best!</p>
