<h2>Interlude 1: Online Gaming Couple’s Chat Log</h2>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> So, my top pick for this season has to be &#8220;Isekai Homeroom.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> You still really like isekai, huh?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Of course! Mahorin, aren&#8217;t you still into the hot-blooded warrior princess?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Definitely! I&#8217;ve loved her since the first episode! It stays intense and exciting from start to finish. Even when things get serious, she breaks them down with passionate energy, making the show enjoyable and reassuring!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Both the story and the animation are seriously solid. And isn&#8217;t it amazing that Oriani is continuing up to the third season? Plus, the excitement level keeps going up with each episode, right?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Exactly! The plot twist of the enemy team in the second season becoming allies in the third is so exciting! And above all, the opening in the third season are just too good! </p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> I totally get that! I mentioned &#8220;Isekai Homeroom&#8221; as my favorite earlier, but when it comes to the OP, the warrior princess beats it by a mile. I&#8217;m generally more of a melody person, but the lyrics in the third season&#8217;s OP are just phenomenal.</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Totally! The song is overflowing with love and feelings towards the warrior princess&#8217;s companions. It&#8217;s a passionate song that makes you feel like crying!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> It even has elements that link directly to the story for fans to speculate!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Wait, wait!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Don&#8217;t give any spoilers, okay? Your theories are always right and you might spoil it!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Got it. By the way, I was listening to the OP just now, and man, it&#8217;s so good.</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>I was listening to it too! Well, singing it, actually lol</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>I can&#8217;t sing in my room; the walls are thin here, I&#8217;d get scolded by my family lol</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Guess you have to go to karaoke then!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> I&#8217;m really feeling like going now lol</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Alright, let&#8217;s go together!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Hey!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Jet Black-kun?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Sorry, sorry! The OP was so amazing I got lost in it! By the way, I was thinking, instead of renting a room for karaoke where you pay based on the number of participants, wouldn&#8217;t it be more cost-effective to go for solo karaoke?&#8221; </p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> But isn&#8217;t it more fun to sing together?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> I totally get what you&#8217;re saying, Mahorin! But, you know, I&#8217;m the type who sings more obscure anime songs. I enjoy it, but it might not be the same for you.</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> I like to listen to songs I don&#8217;t know.</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Oh, really?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Hey, I just checked, and it seems there&#8217;s a collaboration room for &#8220;Isekai Homeroom&#8221; on BigVoice!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>No way! Oh, but it&#8217;s on BigVoice, huh? So, you&#8217;re a BigVoice fan, Mahorin. I&#8217;m more of a ManekiNeko person myself. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m picky or anything, but my first karaoke experience was at ManekiNeko, and there&#8217;s a sort of loyalty or affection there. Not that I have anything against BigVoice, but I&#8217;m just more into the self-anime song challenge. ManekiNeko has a great selection of anime PVs!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>I&#8217;m a ManekiNeko fan too!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Hello?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>What&#8217;s up?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Do you feel like you don&#8217;t want to go to karaoke together?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Sorry, sorry. I forgot I was boiling water and got up. And no way I wouldn&#8217;t want to go with you, Mahorin! Going together would undoubtedly be fun! It&#8217;s just that, I&#8217;m pretty good at singing, so if we go together, I bet you&#8217;ll get all captivated and ask me to sing more. Even if you were to sing, I&#8217;m the type to naturally do otagei<sup data-fn="e1b9163b-d7a2-4399-b7a4-207a52a226e9" class="fn"><a href="#e1b9163b-d7a2-4399-b7a4-207a52a226e9" id="e1b9163b-d7a2-4399-b7a4-207a52a226e9-link">1</a></sup> (otaku performance) when I hear an anime song. Then your focus will break and it&#8217;ll be hard. Plus, I&#8217;m the type who doesn&#8217;t want to let go of the mic! Then you won&#8217;t be able to sing, right?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>You can sing as much as you want.</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Thanks.</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>How about meeting at ManekiNeko in front of Kinjo Station this Saturday at 1:30 PM?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Sure.</p>
