<h2>Chapter 5: My Sister Playing With Her Online Wife</h2>



<p>It was a little past 10 the next morning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we walked towards Koigi Station, Kotomi who was beside me asked hesitantly, &#8220;Do I really not look weird?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I told you, you don&#8217;t look weird.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really, really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, really.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi was concerned about her appearance. Her hair was tied in the usual two knots, and her outfit comprising pants resembling a long skirt with a blouse. While she didn&#8217;t care much about her hairstyle, she was particularly worried about her attire—probably because she was meeting the fashionable Momoi.</p>



<p>&#8220;For starters, Momoi isn&#8217;t the type to nitpick about someone&#8217;s clothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Well, I did get told a thing or two about my casual wear. Like, <em>&#8220;If that&#8217;s your idea of casual, it&#8217;s so damn tacky.&#8221;</em> But now, looking back, I realized I had looked like a thug.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless, Momoi was exceptionally kind to girls. There was no way she&#8217;d say something like <em>&#8220;Your outfit is lame&#8221;</em> to Kotomi, who was trembling like a small animal.</p>



<p>&#8220;Besides, that outfit suits you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mom picked them for me&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mom has a good eye. Hmm&#8230; But have you been shopping together recently?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Two years ago. This is my only outfit.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite a while ago&#8230; Haven&#8217;t you bought any clothes since starting high school?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No. My money disappears quickly with anime, manga, and games. Mom bought these clothes for me because she couldn&#8217;t stand it anymore. I think she will do it again soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make Mom worry too much&#8230; Hey, why not ask Momoi? She can find clothes that suit you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you think it won&#8217;t be a bother?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not at all. After all, she even picked clothes for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>At the mention of clothes, Kotomi seemed to recall something.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, do you mean the outfit from yesterday? It looked stylish.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Right? Momoi chose the shirt and trousers for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>While the initial aim was to become a cool guy that Takase would inadvertently fall for, I liked the outfit so I turned it into my regular wear. I wore something different from yesterday, but if possible, I wanted to go for that look again today.</p>



<p>If going to a clothing store with Momoi alone was hard for Tokomi, then I would tag along. I&#8217;d also like Momoi to help me find some summer clothes along the way.</p>



<p>&#8220;Momoi-san has great taste, huh? She&#8217;s really fashionable&#8230; She won&#8217;t think I&#8217;m lame because I come in pants, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no rule saying pants equals lame.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t a skirt cuter than pants?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you want to be seen as cute?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I just want to avoid being seen as weird.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t need to worry. You&#8217;re not weird.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really, really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, really.&#8221;</p>



<p>As we circled back to the same conversation, we gradually approached our destination. On the other side of the road, Koigishi Station came into view.</p>



<p>Special Land Station was in the opposite direction from Momoi&#8217;s nearest station, Kinjo Station. To meet up, she needed to get off at Koigishi Station. If the schedule wasn&#8217;t disrupted, she should have gotten off the train by now.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Ah.&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, Kotomi&#8217;s steps became heavy. Her face tensed.</p>



<p>She had spotted Momoi. Even from this distance, Momoi had a striking presence.</p>



<p>Her blond hair glinted in the sunlight, and her off-shoulder dress showcased her slender legs. She carried a tote bag in her right hand and played with her smartphone in her left.</p>



<p>&#8220;Momoi-san looks really stylish&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be nervous. Despite appearances, she&#8217;s a hardcore otaku. She&#8217;s your beloved Mahorin.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Momoi-san is&#8230; Mahorin&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Momoi is Mahorin.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My beloved Mahorin, the one I&#8217;m always talking about&#8230; My wife…”</p>



<p>&#8220;How are you feeling now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Better than earlier, maybe.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. Just take it easy. Talk to her whenever you feel comfortable.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a nervous nod, Kotomi followed the advice. As we got closer, Momoi noticed us and stowed her smartphone in her shoulder pouch.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry for making you wait.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I just got here. Hello, Fujisaki-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Momoi greeted her warmly, Kotomi mumbled a shy &#8220;&#8230;H-hi.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Good job, Kotomi. You said it. Now I&#8217;ll help foster a conversation.</em></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Fujisaki too, so why not try calling her by her first name?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I usually differentiate with &#8216;Haruto-kun&#8217; and &#8216;Fujisaki-san,&#8217; though.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m Fujisaki too. If you call me &#8216;Fujisaki-san,&#8217; I would react a bit.&#8221;</p>



<p>Calling each other by their first names should increase familiarity.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it okay if I call you by your first name, Fujisaki-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;y-yes&#8230;don&#8217;t&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a muffled response. Unable to catch it, Momoi glanced at me, silently asking, &#8216;<em>Which is it?&#8217;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright. Then, I&#8217;ll call you Kotomi-san. Feel free to call me whatever you like.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi nodded. After the greetings, we headed into the station. Passing through the ticket gate, we waited on the bustling platform for the train.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, I noticed Kotomi glancing at Momoi&#8217;s tote bag. It could be a good starting point for conversation.</p>



<p>&#8220;What did you bring?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a surprise for later.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was really curious now, but if she said it was for later, I couldn&#8217;t push it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the tote bag topic was off-limits&#8230; how about talking about clothes? We had been discussing it on the way here so Kotomi could easily join in.</p>



<p>&#8220;That outfit suits you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks. It&#8217;s my favorite. You seem a bit warm in that attire, Haruto-kun. Wouldn&#8217;t shorts be more comfortable since it&#8217;s already June?”</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like wearing shorts because people can see my leg hair.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why not just shave?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I consider it a defeat if I do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hehe, who are you competing with?&#8221; Momoi chuckled with a hint of disbelief.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The atmosphere was calm, and now was the right time for Kotomi to join the conversation without feeling too tense.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>Glancing briefly, I noticed Kotomi, who was still hidden behind my large frame, staring intently at Momoi&#8217;s feet.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Don&#8217;t keep staring down there. Although looking at her face was nerve-wracking, at least lift your gaze to her chest or something!</em></p>



<p>If clothes weren&#8217;t a good topic, perhaps bringing up anime would be a good move. But the issue was if Kotomi remained silent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My anime knowledge couldn&#8217;t match up with Momoi, and I risked raising suspicion from her. It was probably wise to avoid bringing up anime casually.</p>



<p>Besides, today&#8217;s destination was the amusement park. Having fun should boost our spirits. The tension would naturally dissipate if the mood elevated.</p>



<p>I tried to convince myself as we boarded the train.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Beneath a sky dotted with thin clouds, we arrived at the amusement park. After purchasing tickets that included a free pass, we walked through a gate adorned with flashy decorations and entered the area.</p>



<p>Perhaps due to it being a Sunday, the park was bustling with activity. People of all ages were present, but families were particularly noticeable with children shouting energetically as they played.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, this is a real amusement park&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi&#8217;s blue eyes sparkled with anticipation as she looked around the park. She looked genuinely thrilled as she was about to experience the amusement park she had always longed for.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>On the other hand, Kotomi was quiet. She stayed close to me like a cat on the train and had been trailing behind me since we got off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we came with our family, she would act more her age and happily played around. But I guess it was different depending on who she came with.</p>



<p>Well, I expected as much.</p>



<p>If dispelling tension on her own was proving difficult, then let&#8217;s rely on the power of attractions.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, what do you want to ride?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Can I decide?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. It&#8217;s your request that brought us here, after all.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s ride them all! &#8230;But, is there enough time?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No problem. But we should decide on the order if we&#8217;re riding everything.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;True. Any recommendations, Haruto-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Recommendations? Hmm&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The last time I visited Special Land was four years ago, and my memory of the attractions was fuzzy at best. Even if asked for recommendations, nothing immediately came to mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a sec,&#8221; I said, unfolding the pamphlet we received at the entrance gate.</p>



<p>&#8220;Show me too,&#8221; Momoi leaned in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our shoulders touched, and with her off-shoulder outfit, her exposed skin briefly caught my eye.</p>



<p>&#8230;Momoi&#8217;s skin was excessively beautiful. On top of that, there was this scent wafting from her, probably shampoo or perfume.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>Seemingly sensing Momoi&#8217;s scent, Kotomi made a slightly insecure expression, as if questioning, <em>&#8216;is she really a human like me?&#8217;</em></p>



<p><em>Don&#8217;t be discouraged. Your shampoo smells great too. Have more confidence. Momoi is human like you so don&#8217;t get intimidated.</em></p>



<p>While sending silent encouragement, I asked Momoi, &#8220;Did you forget to take the pamphlet?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I got one. I want to keep it in good condition as a commemoration of coming to the amusement park.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even as she said that, her eyes remained on the pamphlet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Where should we go&#8230;&#8221; she excitedly scanned the options, then lifted her face, &#8220;How about starting with the roller coaster?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, that sounds good.&#8221;</p>



<p>When it came to amusement parks, roller coaster was a must. Riding one guaranteed a surge in excitement, it&#8217;d be a fun experience.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kotomi-san, are you okay with thrill rides?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kotomi likes heights. She&#8217;s a big fan of roller coasters. She even rode three in a row during our eighth grade.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wow, it must be so much fun. I&#8217;m looking forward to it!&#8221;</p>



<p>With Momoi&#8217;s cheerful voice, we headed towards the roller coaster ride.</p>



<p>We queued up amidst the lively crowd, and after about five minutes, it was our turn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We stowed our bags in the luggage area and followed the staff&#8217;s directions to the coaster. Since the seats were designed for two, someone would be left out.</p>



<p>Riding together would bring Kotomi closer to Momoi.</p>



<p>&#8220;Should I go alone?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How about siblings riding together?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s scary to have an empty seat next to you on your first experience. Kotomi, ride with Momoi.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-no, I&#8217;ll ride alone&#8230; It&#8217;ll be more reassuring for Momoi-san if she&#8217;s with Haru-nii.&#8221;</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t tell if she was being considerate or just shy, but this was probably her longest sentence today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I wished they could interact more, but just being together seemed to ease the tension.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks for being considerate. Can I borrow your brother for a little while?&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi expressed her thanks with a smile and took her seat.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s surprisingly cramped.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just big.&#8221;</p>



<p>After sitting side by side with Momoi, we lowered the shared safety bar. Perhaps because my body had gotten bigger, it felt more constricting than before.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is quite tight.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d be dangerous if it&#8217;s too loose. Does it hurt?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can endure this much. This is my first roller coaster, after all. Unlike VR, this one has real intensity.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>VR, huh?</em> I knew about that. Kotomi mentioned that it was like goggles to play games. I remember she once asked Dad, <em>&#8220;Every household needs VR goggles in the future!&#8221;</em>. But he rejected it, saying,<em> &#8220;It&#8217;s bad for your eyes.&#8221; </em>Kotomi was pretty down after that.</p>



<p>&#8220;VR&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>There was an envious voice from behind. Once Kotomi got closer to Momoi, maybe she&#8217;d let her play too.</p>



<p><em>Riinnngg—!</em> The buzzer sounded, and the coaster started moving, slowly climbing the rails and gradually building up the anticipation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, it goes up pretty high, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Are you scared? You live in a high-rise building, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s different. A high-rise building doesn&#8217;t move.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s higher, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;True, it&#8217;s thirty floors up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thirty floors? That&#8217;s amazing. Must have a great view.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. You can see fireworks beautifully even from the room. I was so impressed when I first moved to Japan.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You must be used to it now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;When you see it every year, yeah. But I prefer watching fireworks with friends.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You mean with Takase and the others?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Exactly. Not at my place, of course, but at the festival grounds.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi was a hidden otaku. She probably couldn&#8217;t casually invite friends over because they would see her otaku merchandise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that regard, Kotomi was an otaku too. Once they became good friends, I&#8217;d love Kotomi to visit her place. From behind, Kotomi still seemed envious as she was murmuring &#8220;V&#8230;R&#8230;&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fireworks are definitely better when you see them live. The vibrations in your belly and the sense of unity in the venue when the sky lights up, I can&#8217;t experience that from my room.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just like fireworks, you can&#8217;t feel the intensity of a roller coaster with VR. Be careful not to bite your tongue.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I will.&#8221;</p>



<p>As we chatted, Momoi&#8217;s fear seemed to fade, and she looked ahead with a bright expression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the coaster reached the top and rapidly descended.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ahhhhhhhh!&#8221;</p>



<p>The coaster went through rapid ascents and descents, sharply turning left and right. In no time, the journey concluded at the finish line.</p>



<p>&#8220;That was exhilarating&#8230; more than I imagined. I thought I&#8217;d be thrown off for sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi&#8217;s immediate commentary proved she enjoyed the roller coaster. After confirming that Kotomi was still behind us, we collected our belongings and left the area.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Ah mou</em>, I took the time to style it and now it&#8217;s all messed up&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Using her phone&#8217;s front camera, Momoi tidied up her tousled blonde hair. When I searched for our next destination in the pamphlet, Momoi looked at me with a smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks for earlier.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;For what?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;For talking to me the whole time to put me at ease.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if you did notice, don&#8217;t say it out loud.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, are you being shy?&#8221;</p>



<p>She peeked at my face with mischievous eyes, making me even more self-conscious. <em>Don&#8217;t tease me in front of my sister. It&#8217;s embarrassing.</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Whatever. Let&#8217;s decide where to go next.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Momoi said, looking into my pamphlet.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Kotomi fixated her gaze on Momoi&#8217;s feet, a somewhat envious glint in her eyes. Was she admiring Momoi&#8217;s slender legs?</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided. Let&#8217;s go to the haunted house.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The haunted house? I&#8217;m serious, it&#8217;s really scary; you might want to reconsider.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, scared, are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine because I know the setup, but the first time can be traumatizing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be okay. I&#8217;ve experienced horror games in VR. I quit pretty quickly, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Momoi, you&#8217;re not good with scary stuff, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, I can&#8217;t exactly say I&#8217;m good at it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then why do you buy horror games?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It came as a set with the VR goggles. I regret playing out of curiosity. Want me to lend it to you next time?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;—!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An inaudible voice of joy reached my ears. When I looked back, Kotomi was nodding enthusiastically. While I&#8217;d prefer to decline since borrowing the game meant I&#8217;d have to play it myself, but…</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks, I&#8217;ll borrow it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll lend it to you next time. But you have to clear the &#8216;<em>Shrine Maiden of the World Tree</em>&#8216; first. I want to discuss our thoughts on it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it. So, to sum it up, Momoi is also not a fan of haunted houses.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better than horror games. Besides, it won&#8217;t be scary with three of us &#8230;How about you, Kotomi-san? Do haunted houses bother you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi responded with a slightly cheerful tone. Her excitement apparently had risen at the prospect of borrowing the VR game. And indeed, she was quite good at horror-themed stuff.</p>



<p>&#8220;Great. Then, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>



<p>The three of us walked to the haunted house.</p>



<p>Eventually, we saw a large building resembling a tunnel. A car covered in blood and rust was parked at the entrance. The place was called the &#8216;<em>Haunted Spot Tour</em>,&#8217; featuring a conveyor belt that took you around the inside.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s different than I expected.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Want to skip it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve come this far. We can&#8217;t back down now.&#8221;</p>



<p>We followed the staff&#8217;s instructions and got on the wagon. It could accommodate three people. The interior was modified to allow three in the front row, with acrylic protective panels added to the cluttered rear seats.</p>



<p>I took the driver&#8217;s seat, Kotomi in the passenger seat, and Momoi in the middle. The conveyor belt started moving.</p>



<p>The tunnel-themed interior was dominated by dim lighting, providing poor visibility.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite dark. Turn on the lights, please.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s broken.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, right. Well, never mind. Whatever comes out, it won&#8217;t get inside anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The door isn&#8217;t locked.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Lock it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s broken.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, how about bright music to lighten the mood―&#8221;</p>



<p><em>*BANG!*&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>A bloodied woman pounded on the driver&#8217;s side window.</p>



<p>&#8220;KYYAAAAAAAAAAA!!!&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, quit that—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Quick, quick! Escape quickly, hurry, hurry!”</p>



<p>&#8220;S-Stop shaking, stop shaking!&#8221;</p>



<p><em>*BANG!* *BANG!*</em></p>



<p>&#8220;No, no! I can&#8217;t take anymore! I hate this!&#8221;</p>



<p>While Momoi was frightened, the woman who had been pounding on the door disappeared. Momoi unconsciously gripped my wrist tightly, her body trembling.</p>



<p>&#8220;How much longer till we get there?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;About five minutes?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is going to be the longest five minutes of my life&#8230;&#8221; she said with an almost-cry voice. She then took a deep breath to calm her racing heart.</p>



<p>Suddenly, another bloodied woman appeared right in front of us.</p>



<p>&#8220;KYAAAAAAAA!!&#8221;</p>



<p>The woman climbed onto the hood, banging on the windshield.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, no, no, noooooooooo!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi clung to my neck. A soft object pressed against my shoulder. It was a bit like a back hug when we pretended to be lovers, but this direct contact was a first. The sensation of her chest was seriously overwhelming.</p>



<img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/1000010364.png">



<p>&#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re too close&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, no! I don&#8217;t want to let go! It&#8217;s scary! Too scary!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit hard to breathe&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be mean! Endure it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kotomi, say something to her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uh, um&#8230; The woman is probably new. You can see embarrassment on her face.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, look closely, Momoi. She&#8217;s blushing!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, no! I don&#8217;t want to see her face! I&#8217;ll have nightmares!&#8221;</p>



<p>Maybe feeling awkward or done with her role, the woman left after our comments.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, how much time has passed?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;About four minutes?&#8221;</p>



<p>Before we realized it, we had reached the halfway point and and now we were heading back the way we came. Momoi saw the light from the entrance, she breathed a sigh of relief—</p>



<p><em>*BANG!*&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The acrylic protective panel was struck, and a bloodied woman reflected in the rearview mirror. Apparently, she had been hiding in the back seat from the beginning.</p>



<p>&#8220;NOOOOO, SHE&#8217;S COMING IN! SHE&#8217;S COMING IN!”</p>



<p>I could endure it since I knew what to expect, but Momoi was genuinely terrified. She was clinging to me with even more force than before, and I seriously thought I was suffocating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We somehow managed to reach the end. When the staff opened the door, Momoi pushed her way out.</p>



<p>She stepped out into the sun and crouched down right on the spot.</p>



<p>&#8230;I quickly averted my eyes, but for a moment, I caught a glimpse of her underwear. Between the sensation of her chest and the accidental exposure, my heart couldn&#8217;t stop pounding.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m definitely going to dream about this&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it is what it is. Let&#8217;s just overwrite it with a fun memory.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; I want to have some fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Uttering those words weakly, Momoi stood up. I expected her to be scared, but I never thought she&#8217;d be this frightened. Seeing her in such a state earlier surely left an impression on Kotomi as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi was still looking down. Looks like she was still too nervous to face Momoi directly. In that case, let&#8217;s try to relax both of them.</p>



<p>It was almost noon. It&#8217;d be better to grab lunch now before the place gets too crowded. A good meal should soothe our nerves.</p>



<p>&#8220;How about having lunch soon?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sounds good. Is there a plaza or something around here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re looking for a picnic area, there&#8217;s one, but&#8230; don&#8217;t you want to go to a restaurant?&#8221;</p>



<p>In response to my question, Momoi proudly lifted her tote bag.</p>



<p>&#8220;I brought lunch!&#8221;</p>



<p><em>So, the thing she said to look forward to is the lunch box!</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Did you really make these? You didn&#8217;t have to go through the trouble&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, since you came with me to the amusement park, I thought I should express my gratitude.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I see. Thanks.&#8221;</p>



<p>No, I genuinely appreciated the sentiment. We could save on food costs, and there was refreshing feeling when eating outside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the taste…</p>



<p>&#8220;What did you make, by the way?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fried rice. It&#8217;s your favorite, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah. I really love your fried rice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear that. I made plenty, so make sure to have some too, Kotomi-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-yes. Thanks, Momoi-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi, oblivious to the situation, expressed her gratitude sincerely. However, I couldn&#8217;t let her eat it. Our taste buds were so similar that she&#8217;d be in for a surprise if she tried it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Considering Kotomi&#8217;s personality, she&#8217;d end up eating it all because she couldn&#8217;t&nbsp;turn down the goodwill. I had to step in.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry, but could you give all the fried rice to me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? Haru-nii, you&#8217;re going to eat it alone?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be greedy. I made enough for two people.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to eat as much of your cooking. But, why is it enough for two?&#8221;</p>



<p>We had three people here.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, you see, I&#8217;m not that great at cooking. After tasting it, I thought, <em>&#8216;This is no good.&#8217;</em> But Haruto-kun seemed to like it, and since siblings often share similar tastes, I thought Kotomi-san would like it too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She probably will, but I&#8217;ll be eating all the fried rice. You two enjoy the park&#8217;s food.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You really like my cooking, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi looked happy. I&#8217;d have to eat it convincingly to avoid hurting her feelings.</p>



<p>Anyway, bringing our lunch into the restaurant would be inconvenient. We decided to buy their lunch at the stalls and headed there after checking the location on the pamphlet.</p>



<p>During lunchtime, the area around the stalls was bustling with people.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are quite a few options.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi&#8217;s voice was full of excitement. Not just about the crowd but likely the variety of the menu.</p>



<p>From soft-serve ice cream to juice, crepes, shaved ice, hot dogs, sandwiches, and a wide range of bento boxes, the selection was outstanding. Children pressed their faces against the display, and adults discussed what to buy while looking at the posters of the dishes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you buying anything, Haruto-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of getting an orange juice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve already decided. I might take a bit longer; is that okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No worries. Take your time choosing so you won&#8217;t regret it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then Momoi earnestly examined the food posters with a serious expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, there are at least a dozen options for bento.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The hot dogs have this crispy sausage. It&#8217;s really delicious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Ah, mou</em>, just when I finally narrowed it down to bento&#8230; Don&#8217;t make me second-guess again. By the way, how about soft-serve? Is it good?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The vanilla is rich and incredibly tasty, but let&#8217;s save soft-serve for later.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;re right. It&#8217;s time for a meal!&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps enticed by the sweet aroma, Momoi shook her head to dispel the temptation and continued contemplating the bento posters.</p>



<p>Ten minutes passed.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Have you decided yet?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just a little more. I&#8217;ve narrowed it down to two.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why not get both?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll gain weight if I eat two.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you worrying about gaining weight when you&#8217;re already skinny?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My skinny figure is the result of hard work. I do exercise regularly.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you go to the gym?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I do fitness games with a boxing workout.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, that sounds interesting.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought it would be a hassle at first, but surprisingly, it has a good storyline so it&#8217;s enjoyable. &#8230;Okay, I&#8217;ve decided. I&#8217;ll go with the hamburger bento.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Have you decided, Kotomi?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go for the seaweed bento.”</p>



<p>With our orders settled, we walked towards the queue. Soon enough, an older man lined up behind us. He didn&#8217;t look like someone enjoying an amusement park alone, so maybe he came to buy something while the kids were busy with the attractions.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, by the way, in the boxing workout game, you can choose a trainer. And guess what, MioMio-chan&#8217;s voice actress is one of the options.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although I was a bit startled with a sudden anime topic, I could handle it as long as it was about Driste.</p>



<p>&#8220;No way! Taniguchi-san is also doing a role there?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, and the trainer acts exactly like MioMio-chan! It&#8217;s like being cheered on by MioMio-chan herself!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That should boost the motivation!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Exactly! And she sings a birthday song on your birthday too!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d want every day to be my birthday at that rate!&#8221;</p>



<p>Speaking of which, what was Kotomi up to? We were talking about her favorite Driste here, she should join in on this conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I wondered if she was secretly eyeing Momoi&#8217;s legs again, but I was surprised to find Kotomi looking up.</p>



<p>&#8220;U-um! P-please stop that&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>She let out the loudest voice of the day. It wasn&#8217;t a murmur, but a statement that was directed towards the older man behind us. Even though Kotomi wasn&#8217;t type to intimidate others, she somehow managed to make the older man flustered.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-what are you talking about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;S-since a while ago, you&#8217;ve been taking pictures, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Huh, taking pictures?</em></p>



<p>The people nearby turned their attention to us, and the man&#8217;s face grew even tenser.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-what are you saying all of a sudden? I&#8217;m going to sue you for defamation!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi flinched at his yell. Still, without retracting her statement, she pointed at the ground with trembling fingers.</p>



<p>&#8220;U-um, that&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi pointed at the old man&#8217;s shoes. Bathed in sunlight, a small hole at the tip twinkled. No way—</p>



<p>&#8220;A hidden camera!?&#8221;</p>



<p>In the next moment, as I spotted what seemed to be a small camera, the old man bolted.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, wait!&#8221;</p>



<p>I chased after him with all my might. I was confident in my athletic abilities. There was no way I&#8217;d lose to a chubby middle-aged man!</p>



<p>I caught up in no time, firmly grabbing his arm and glared at him.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-what are you doing!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my line!&#8221;</p>



<p>Whether he didn&#8217;t expect to be yelled back at or only now noticed my physique and face, the old man looked scared.</p>



<p>&#8220;P-please, spare me! Let me go!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Spare you? After you&#8217;ve been secretly photographing my friend? No way!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;ll delete them later! I&#8217;ll turn myself in!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Like I&#8217;d believe that!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let go! Please let me go!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop resisting!&#8221;</p>



<p>Once he realized persuasion wasn&#8217;t working, he desperately tried to escape, but I had the upper hand in strength. Little did I expect that my middle school days&#8217; weight training would come in handy like this. You never know what life would throw at you.</p>



<p>After struggling for a while, he was either realizing he couldn&#8217;t escape or simply running out of energy. The old man began to calm down. Soon after, someone must had called for help as a security guard rushed over.</p>



<p>&#8220;This guy was secretly photographing with a camera in his shoe.&#8221;</p>



<p>I pushed the old man forward and informed the security guard who approached with a stern expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that true?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>As the guard checked the shoes to confirm and found the camera, he sighed in exasperation.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re over fifty, right? What are you doing at your age?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m truly sorry&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good grief. Anyway, come with me to the security office.&#8221;</p>



<p>The old man lowered his head, concealing his face from the onlookers and was quietly escorted away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun, are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you get hit&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi and Kotomi rushed over, there was concern in their voices.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank goodness&#8230; But really, Haruto-kun, you were so brave. You chased after him without knowing what he might do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haru-nii, you looked like a police officer. That was cool!&#8221;</p>



<p>Getting praised by both of them simultaneously made me feel a bit embarrassed. However, I couldn&#8217;t hog all the credit.</p>



<p>&#8220;The real hero is Kotomi. Not everyone would notice a tiny camera like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>While it was natural to be suspicious if someone stood behind you on the street, it was common to line up in an amusement park. Moreover, since I was talking to Momoi, I couldn&#8217;t have noticed his legs under her skirt.</p>



<p>&#8220;I-it was just by chance. I happened to be looking down, and then I saw that man&#8217;s leg under Momoi-san&#8217;s skirt&#8230; But, I was worried about what would happen if I was wrong, so it was hard to say anything&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>“But you had the courage to point it out.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you scared? If you whispered it to me, I would have said it for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was scared, but I didn&#8217;t want to interrupt your conversation&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to be so considerate.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But Momoi-san looked like she was having so much fun&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Momoi smiled kindly at Kotomi, who was glancing down with a shy look.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s fun talking to Haruto-kun, but I&#8217;d also like to have fun chatting with Kotomi-san. We&#8217;re friends, after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; Kotomi lifted her face as if surprised, &#8220;Friends&#8230;?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re playing together at the amusement park. That makes us friends, right?”</p>



<p>&#8220;Momoi-san and I are&#8230; friends.&#8221;</p>



<p>She savored the words, rolling them around in her mouth, and a slow, joyous smile spread across her face.</p>



<p>This marked the moment my sister gained her first real friend. I&#8217;d love to take a photo to commemorate this, but it would be intrusive. I&#8217;d just etch this moment into my memory. <em>Really, I&#8217;m so happy for you, Kotomi!</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Feel free to talk to me anytime from now on, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; I will. I want to.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a happy nod, Kotomi glanced at Momoi&#8217;s shoes. Even though they had become friends, looks like conversing while making eye contact was still a bit nerve-wracking for her.</p>



<p>Just as I was pondering this, Kotomi mustered the courage and asked;</p>



<p>&#8220;Those shoes, they&#8217;re from the collaboration with the <em>Passionate Warrior Princess</em>, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi&#8217;s face lightened up instantly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes! Exactly! It&#8217;s the Binetsu-chan model from the &#8216;<em>Passionate Warrior Princess</em>&#8216;!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew it! I&#8217;ve been wondering if they were! Whoa, you managed to snag the collaboration sneakers! And it&#8217;s the most popular Binetsu-chan model, no less!&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi looked at Kotomi with expectant eyes as Kotomi enthusiastically raised her excitement.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have another collaboration item&#8230; Can you guess what it is?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know! It&#8217;s the tote bag! It&#8217;s Chieatsu-chan model, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Exactly! It&#8217;s the exact same tote bag Chieatsu-chan used in the series!&#8221;</p>



<p>By the way, it featured an illustration of a cat with a cooling sheet on its forehead. In my eyes, it was just a cute bag, but for those in the know, it was unmistakably a collaboration item.</p>



<p>I see. So that&#8217;s why Kotomi frequently glanced at Momoi&#8217;s shoes. It wasn&#8217;t that she was too shy to make eye contact; she simply wanted to strike up a conversation.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you noticed, Kotomi-san. Haruto-kun never points these things out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;M-My bad. I didn&#8217;t notice. I was focused on your clothes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a collaboration item, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know. I just thought it was a nice outfit. Right, Kotomi?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. It&#8217;s really cute.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks. Your outfit is cute too, Kotomi-san. You&#8217;ve got a good sense of style.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My mom actually picked this out for me&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Instead of simply accepting the compliment, Kotomi looked hesitant as if reluctant to snatch credit from our mother.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, really? Don&#8217;t you shop for clothes yourself?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hardly ever. I don&#8217;t really know much about fashion&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then, how about I help you pick some?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure thing. There&#8217;s a mall nearby, we can make a little detour on our way back.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, alright. I&#8217;d like that. And I&#8217;d like to stop by the bookstore too. The new volume of <em>Psychic English</em> is out today.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh right! I need to grab one too! I always stick to physical copies to avoid spoilers!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Me too! I&#8217;m excited to see who passes the survival arc!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi, who was reserved just moments ago, now spoke with lively enthusiasm. On the other hand, Momoi was genuinely enjoying the otaku talk.</p>



<p>With this atmosphere, it seemed like they could become close friends in real life as easily as in an online game.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, want to exchange contact info?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, please!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And, how about going to the <em>Passionate Warrior Princess </em>art exhibition together sometime?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in! Totally in!&#8221;</p>


<img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/1000010377.png">


<p>The plan for their next outing was already in the works. Although Momoi enjoyed the meet-up with me, she&#8217;d even have more fun exploring her interests together with Kotomi.</p>



<p>From now on, they&#8217;d probably go out to anime stores, have tea at collaboration cafes, and host anime song karaoke competitions together. Although the thought of not joining them was a bit sad, staying up all night to accumulate anime knowledge was seriously difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;d savor the sense of liberation for now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks, Haru-nii! You really pushed me forward!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to thank you too. Because of you, I&#8217;ve gained an otaku friend!&#8221;</p>



<p>Both of them expressed their gratitude with beaming smiles, and my cheeks naturally loosened.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;As a thank-you, I&#8217;ll make you fried rice again sometime!&#8221;</p>



<p>I wanted to commend myself for not letting my cheeks twitch.</p>
