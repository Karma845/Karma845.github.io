<h2>Interlude 2: Online Gaming Couple&#8217;s Chat Log</h2>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> That&#8217;s why, the new release I&#8217;m really looking forward to is Magical Momochi 2!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Finally, the release date is confirmed!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> It felt like forever since the announcement until now </p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Gotta review the previous installment before it comes out!!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Definitely. But seriously, too many amazing games are dropping at the same time! My wallet&#8217;s in trouble lol</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Ironically, I envy you! I only want Magical Momoji 2 during this period</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Urbat 2 seems like another god-tier game, right? Do you know Urbat?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Yeah, I know. You told me about it before. After that, I checked out the PV afterward</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>How was it?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> It looks interesting, but also a bit challenging. I&#8217;m not great with action games. Although I watch various anime, I seek relaxation in games.</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Come to think of it, Mahorin, you always bring up slow-life games. And mostly indie ones</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>True, but isn&#8217;t it impressive that you can keep up with the discussions? Your knowledge base is ridiculously wide, haha</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> I just know them as information, lol</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Really?</p>



<p><strong>Jey Black Yasha:</strong> Well, games cost money! I sell any game I finish playing unless I really liked it. Even then, it&#8217;s not enough. I wish my backyard produced oil or something.</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> So, you&#8217;re into physical copies, Jet Black-kun?</p>



<p><strong>Jey Black Yasha:</strong> Are you more into downloads?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Yep. Oh, but for my favorite games, I buy the physical copy for the special bonuses ~</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> I totally get that! Choosing where to buy Urbat was a real struggle. The store bonuses were amazing!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>You&#8217;re really hyping up Urbat, lol</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Seriously, it&#8217;s an awesome game! By the way, what&#8217;s your absolute favorite, Mahorin?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> I highly recommend the Shrine Maiden of the World Tree!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Oh, the one you mentioned before. I thought about buying it, but it was crazy expensive</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Then I&#8217;ll lend it to you!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Let&#8217;s also play Urbat together!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Hellooo? Jet Black-kun?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Sorry, sorry. Do you play Urbat at home?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Yeah</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Does it have to be at home?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Do you want to come to my house?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:&nbsp;</strong> Not like that. I looked it up, and it seems you can play games at an internet cafe</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Is that so?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>As far as I found. You have to bring your own console, but it&#8217;s not much to carry. They also have unlimited drinks, all-you-can-eat ice cream, and air conditioning. Doesn&#8217;t that sound perfect for gaming?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong>&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never been to an internet cafe, so I wouldn&#8217;t know</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> That&#8217;s surprising. You can also read manga as much as you want there</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Those places are a bit scary to go alone, lol</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>What if there are two of us?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Sure. Which internet cafe?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Didn&#8217;t we go to the collaboration cafe last month? How about the internet cafe on the first or second floor there?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> It&#8217;s finally time to do infiltration, lol When are we going?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Whenever it suits you</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>How about tomorrow at 1pm?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Got it</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> It&#8217;s decided! I&#8217;m so excited! I&#8217;ll go to bed early for tomorrow!</p>



<p><strong>Jey Black Yasha: </strong>Good night</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Good night~!</p>
