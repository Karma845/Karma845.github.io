<h1>Chapter 4: Battling My Younger Sister’s Online Wife</h1>



<p>It was early June, Friday night.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haru-nii! Haru-nii!&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite achieving my best ranking ever—second in class and eighth in the grade during midterms—I remained focused on studying for the upcoming final exams when I heard the door was vigorously pounded.</p>



<p>With a sense of foreboding, I opened the door to find Kotomi standing there, her face on the verge of tears. This could only mean one thing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it related to Mahorin again?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about Mahorin! Please, Haru-nii, chat with her for me!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re at that point already?&#8221;</p>



<p>When Kotomi asked me for karaoke, I had informed her that if she got invited to the next offline meetup, she should ask me to chat in her stead. Following my instructions, she ran to me immediately. It was a significant improvement compared to the last-minute request for a stand-in at the first offline meetup.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hurry, hurry!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi grabbed my hand and led me to her room.</p>



<p>Although I had helped her clean up after exams, the room was messy again. The air conditioner hadn&#8217;t been cleaned in a while, probably due to her reluctance to let maintenance workers in. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if she fell ill.</p>



<p>I suppressed the urge to nag and sat on the gaming chair as directed.</p>



<p>The monitor displayed a game screen I hadn&#8217;t seen before, apparently it was called &#8220;Life of Farmer.&#8221;</p>



<p>As expected from a slow-life game, peaceful music played in the background. An attractive man and woman sat side by side on a sofa by the fireplace, with the chat log visible at the bottom.</p>



<p>After skimming through a few lines, it seemed Kotomi had been invited to the game but hadn&#8217;t accepted yet.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is declining not an option?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-no! If I decline, she&#8217;ll hate me&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>Even if she did decline, Mahorin wouldn&#8217;t hate her&#8230; Well, disappointment might set in. I could feel Momoi&#8217;s excitement through the text as well. The past two offline meetings must be really fun for her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, alright. I won&#8217;t say no.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, accepting Momoi&#8217;s request as it was wouldn&#8217;t be feasible. If Momoi showed up instead of Mahorin, Kotomi would likely realize her true identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the chat logs, Mahorin&#8217;s goal was to play the game together. The location shouldn&#8217;t matter.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kotomi, do you know any places where we can play games?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Like internet cafes?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, could you look up the one near Kinjo Station?&#8221;</p>



<p>While Kotomi was searching on her phone, I confirmed with Momoi if it was okay to choose a place other than my house. Just as Momoi asked, <em>&#8220;Do you want to come to my place?&#8221; </em>Kotomi showed me her phone screen.</p>



<p>&#8220;Looks like you can bring your own games to that internet cafe.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the search results, aside from being able to bring your games, they also provided free drinks and ice cream. It was like a paradise for manga enthusiasts.</p>



<p>I quickly listed the benefits of the internet cafe and successfully got Momoi excited about the idea. Since we were only playing games, the time didn&#8217;t matter. When she suggested tomorrow at 1:00 PM, I immediately agreed.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Got it,&#8221; </em>I typed, and after exchanging goodbyes, the beautiful avatar disappeared from the screen, presumably logging out.</p>



<p>All that was left was to play games with Momoi tomorrow. Because we weren&#8217;t watching anime, I could get through this without being exposed as a stand-in.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry, Haru-nii, for taking up another weekend&#8230;&#8221; Kotomi looked downcast, genuinely apologetic.</p>



<p>I had no intention of blaming Kotomi.</p>



<p>It might be excessive to be unable to refuse a request just because you didn&#8217;t want to be disliked, but on the flip side, it showed how much she cared about Mahorin. Involving her brother might be a bit much, but I wanted to respect her feelings about valuing her friendship.</p>



<p>&#8220;No worries. It&#8217;s way better than the last two times.&#8221;</p>



<p>During the collaboration cafe and karaoke, I ended up staying overnight to binge-watch anime.</p>



<p>This time, we would just play a game together. I wouldn&#8217;t need to stumble through anime conversations, and we could even switch to manga midway, using the fact that we were in an internet café as an excuse.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright then, I&#8217;ll get back to studying. Make sure you don&#8217;t stay up too late, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, you&#8217;re going to study?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why does that surprise you?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Stop making that face; it&#8217;s giving me a bad feeling.</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Well, because you&#8217;re going to play Urbat tomorrow. Don&#8217;t you need to practice?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you setting unnecessarily high standards again, like you did with karaoke?&#8221;</p>



<p>Back then, there were unnecessary high standards like &#8216;good at singing,&#8217; &#8216;otaku performance,&#8217; and &#8216;never letting go of the microphone.&#8217;</p>



<p>Though there was no mention of such things in the chat logs, maybe such topics had come up in the past.</p>



<p>Kotomi shook her head, &#8220;Mahorin doesn&#8217;t delve much into Urbat topics, so we haven&#8217;t talked much about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really? You&#8217;re not boasting about being at a &#8216;pro level&#8217; or anything?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good, then&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But, it&#8217;s a bit unnatural to move like a beginner.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a point. How long does it take to no longer look like a beginner?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Urbat has simple controls, so you can get the hang of it in about three hours. Just try moving all the characters for now, pick your main, and clear that character&#8217;s story mode.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s all&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>It was just past 9 PM. Even with practice, I should be able to get to sleep before the date changes. Compared to the last two offline meetups, this was much more manageable—</p>



<p>&#8220;Also, you need to watch all episodes of the Urbat anime!&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Not again, damn it!</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Urbat has an anime!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s technically based on a manga. I don&#8217;t have the manga, and I don&#8217;t have money to buy it, so watching the anime is the only option. Don&#8217;t worry; I&#8217;ve confirmed it&#8217;s available for streaming.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But, Mahorin isn&#8217;t interested in Urbat, right? Do I really need to watch the anime?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She hasn&#8217;t played the game because she&#8217;s not good at action, but she said she likes Urbat. If you play the game, the conversation will definitely shift to the characters.&#8221;</p>



<p>As usual, the only option was to watch the anime to keep up the pretense.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;How many episodes are there? Twelve? Twenty-four?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Two hundred.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way I can make it in time!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi flinched.</p>



<p><em>Come on, don&#8217;t make that teary-eyed face. If anyone wants to cry, it should be me.</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Um, I was about to say it&#8217;s impossible, but Haru-nii immediately typed &#8216;Got it,&#8217; &#8230;W-What should we do, Haru-nii?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What should we do? It&#8217;s pretty clear that two hundred episodes are impossible. Even if we assume each episode is twenty-five minutes, that&#8217;s eighty-three hours.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It would take about three and a half days&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t naturally exclude my sleep time. If we stretch it, two weeks at most, or heck, give me a whole month.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Does that mean the plan will be postponed…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no other choice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No, that&#8217;s not good. Mahorin is looking forward to it&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t want to suggest a postponement either. It wasn&#8217;t even 9 PM yet, and Momoi was already saying about going to bed early for tomorrow. She was probably lying in bed right now, feeling excited. It&#8217;d be difficult to bring up the idea.</p>



<p>However&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t postpone, I&#8217;ll be lacking in knowledge.&#8221;</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t even know if &#8220;Urbat&#8221; was the full title or an abbreviation.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ll teach you the controls and explain the characters while we play. If you play the story mode with the main characters, you&#8217;ll get the hang of the story&#8217;s flow. We&#8217;ll manage somehow.&#8221;</p>



<p>Facing an offline meetup after an all-nighter was worrisome, but looking back, I always got through them with makeshift solutions.</p>



<p>If there were two hundred episodes, the story was bound to be so lengthy that there must be parts she only vaguely remembered. An all-nighter could work.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be pulling an all-nighter too, Kotomi. Is that okay with you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m totally fine. I&#8217;m actually happy because I get to play games with Haru-nii!&#8221;</p>



<p>I hadn&#8217;t played a game with Kotomi since we were kids. I remembered bringing a fighting game to Grandma&#8217;s house, getting beaten badly, and quickly throwing the controller.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then, let&#8217;s play Urbat.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah! I&#8217;ll set up right away, so wait for me!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi eagerly prepared for the game, her voice brimming with excitement.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>And so, the following Saturday arrived.</p>



<p>Five minutes before our meeting, I reached the Kinjo Station. The sky, though clear, couldn&#8217;t shake off the muggy air that enveloped me as soon as I left the station. The dry May weather felt oddly nostalgic&#8230;</p>



<p>Battling both the heat and the drowsiness threatening to knock me out, I entered the multi-purpose building. There, in front of the door to the internet cafe, stood Momoi.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I got here a minute ago. You&#8217;re running late today.&#8221;</p>



<p>If this were a date with Takase, I&#8217;d be here thirty minutes early, but this was Momoi. Moreover, it wasn&#8217;t even a date. Just showing up before the agreed time should be more than sufficient.</p>



<p>&#8220;My bad for making you wait a whole minute.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Your words have a bit of an edge. You could be gentler, you know, like the other day?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;At that time, I was the one who insisted on participating in the study session. I felt a bit guilty for that. Anyway, how&#8217;d your exams go?&#8221;</p>



<p>I hadn&#8217;t heard anything about Momoi&#8217;s test scores. We still didn&#8217;t interact at school. We were having this conversation now for the first time since watching Maison de Night together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I knew Takase managed to avoid failing a subject because she quietly thanked me, saying, <em>&#8220;Thanks to you, I got 52 points.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Momoi looked pleased, &#8220;Thanks to you, I got a good score. My grade shot up by twenty positions in one go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. If you ever need help with studying again, feel free to ask.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you sure it&#8217;s not a bother?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not at all. Teaching helps me review, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, you&#8217;re unexpectedly kind. I&#8217;ll count on you next time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alright. This way, I could have another study session with Takase. I&#8217;d show her that I was even more reliable than last time and earn some favorable impressions!</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, shall we go in?&#8221;</p>



<p>We walked through the automatic door into the internet cafe. Unlike the karaoke place where I scared the staff, perhaps thanks to the clothes Momoi picked, the staff welcomed me with a smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome. A party of two, I presume? How would you like your room?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Any recommendations?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s room where you can comfortably play games.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, the website says you can bring your own games, is that true?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. In that case, I recommend the sofa room.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, let&#8217;s go for that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Understood. How long will you be using the room?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;About three hours, is that okay with you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, that sounds good.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s your first time, we&#8217;ll need you to create a membership card&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, might as well create one.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pass.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, I&#8217;ll do it then.&#8221;</p>



<p>With the procedures smoothly done, we received a card key with the room number and proceeded down the aisle lined with manga shelves.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my first time here, but the selection is incredible. This is like heaven.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you liked it that much, you should&#8217;ve made a membership card.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No need. I only come here with you, anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You were saying it&#8217;s scary even yesterday. Are you worried about getting hit on?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. I mean, look, I&#8217;m cute, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you really have to say that about yourself?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Being modest with this appearance is more like sarcasm. Besides, the only guys at school who doesn&#8217;t think I&#8217;m cute is you, Haruto-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re cute; it&#8217;s just a matter of preference.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, really? You find me cute then?&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though Momoi didn&#8217;t like the idea of me being attracted to her, she still looked happy. Well, being praised still made anyone feel good, after all.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, what&#8217;s your type, Haruto-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then let me guess. Hmm&#8230; based on your track record, it&#8217;s probably girls like Nayuta or Yayoi, right?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Don&#8217;t use anime characters as examples.</em> I had no clue who they were. And I didn&#8217;t want to have this kind of conversation with a girl. It was just plain embarrassing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, found it. Here&#8217;s the room.&#8221;</p>



<p>Luckily, we found a room at just the right time, thus diverting the conversation. I unlocked the door with the key card and we entered.</p>



<p>Perhaps because the sofa was too big, it felt cramped for two people. The distance to the monitor was short, and staring at it for too long might strain our eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll grab some drinks; get the game ready.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks. I&#8217;ll have orange juice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>I left my bag with the game and exited the room. Returning with cola and orange juice, everything was already set up. Momoi was holding an unfamiliar controller.</p>



<p>&#8220;You brought your own?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This one feels more familiar.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re really into this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I came to win today. Hey, want to make a bet?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Like buying drinks if you lose?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Drinks are free here so that won&#8217;t work. How about this: if you win ten times and I get just one, the winner can make any request to the loser. How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too much in your favor.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a beginner, you know? I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be bad for you if I have a little advantage.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sure, I was a beginner too, but I practiced all night. There was no doubt I was better than Momoi.</p>



<p>As Kotomi said, the controls were simple, but it took me three hours to go from beginner to intermediate. Since we were only staying at the internet cafe for three hours, Momoi wouldn&#8217;t be able to get past the beginner stage. In other words, there was no way I could lose.</p>



<p><em>But still&#8230;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really have anything to ask of you, Momoi.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, if you win ten times, I&#8217;ll make you bento for a week.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, bento!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ll discreetly hand it over so no one gets the wrong idea. How about it? Are you feeling motivated now?&#8221;</p>



<p>If anything, I almost wanted to lose. But I couldn&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t want to eat her cooking because it&#8217;d hurt her.</p>



<p>&#8220;That sounds like a hassle. If I win, you&#8217;ll have to grant me another request.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to hold back. Well, fine. Is the bet on?&#8221;</p>



<p>I nodded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I practiced a lot yesterday. In the end, I couldn&#8217;t win a single match against Kotomi, but she praised me with a, &#8216;<em>You&#8217;ve got potential</em>.&#8217;</p>



<p>On the other hand, Momoi was a beginner. Moreover, she claimed that she was bad with action games. There was no way I could lose!</p>



<p>We started the game and reached the character selection screen. I chose the protagonist, Axel, without hesitation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, Axel, huh? Then I&#8217;ll go with Rocket!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, a showdown between master and student, huh? Just like in an anime.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That development was amazing! Axel tried to infiltrate Dr. Punk&#8217;s hideout alone to rescue the kidnapped Oil-chan, and Rocket wanted to stop him because it&#8217;s too dangerous! A clash between men!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Axel barely won, but in reality, Rocket wasn&#8217;t giving it his all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, he was tough on Axel, but deep down, he thought of him like a son!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;After sensing Rocket&#8217;s true feelings, Axel whispers, &#8216;<em>Thank you</em>, Dad,&#8217; as he leaves. That scene was epic!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And when Axel was about to lose to Dr. Punk, Rocket rushed in. That&#8217;s when you finally witness the true strength of the master!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Such an unbeatable scene! That was so intense!&#8221;</p>



<p>In Axel&#8217;s story mode, his master Rocket would ultimately get defeated by Dr. Punk and died after pushing the enemy forces to the brink of destruction. I thought I was going to cry at that point because it was late at night and Kotomi was sobbing next to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;And then, when Axel vows revenge for his master, we enter the second part! His design with a fallen dark style was tickling the inner adolescent spirit. It&#8217;s so cool!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The part where he takes on an apprentice like Rocket did back then was incredible! I&#8217;m using Engine next!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aaah, I wanted to use him too!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s first come, first served.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then next time, I&#8217;ll bring in the dark Axel for a second master-student showdown!”</p>



<p>While getting fueled with the knowledge we gained from story mode, we selected our characters and the battle began.</p>



<p>I chose Axel, who was wielding a dagger as a speedy type before his fall into darkness. In contrast, Rocket swung a greatsword as a power type.</p>



<p>Having cleared Axel&#8217;s story mode, I had already experienced the master-student showdown. I had overcome my master once. I knew Rocket&#8217;s strategy inside out.</p>



<p>Rocket had strength, but his movements were slow. Facing him head-on would lead to a disadvantage. The best approach was to employ hit-and-run tactics, swiftly seizing opportunities while keeping a safe distance.</p>



<p>Slicing through the air like a butterfly and striking like a wasp, Axel made his moves.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hn! Hn! Take that!&#8221;</p>



<p>Then, Momoi began rapidly tapping buttons and vigorously shaking the controller from side to side. It was distracting as hell&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, stop moving—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Opening spotted!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, wait!&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Shing!</em> Rocket&#8217;s special move landed a clean hit. Axel&#8217;s health bar was significantly depleted, and he collapsed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yay! I win!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That was cheating! Stop moving your body!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped. My body just moves on its own.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even so—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I mention it in the chat before?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, right, you did. My bad. If that&#8217;s the case, I guess it&#8217;s unavoidable.&#8221;</p>



<p>Damn. I couldn&#8217;t come up with a retort. I had no choice but to accept the challenge knowing Momoi would move her body.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, what do you want me to do?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you later, all at once.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>All at once…</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Are you planning to ask for something every time you win?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the plan.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I never agreed to that!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, for a beginner like me, it&#8217;s not a big deal, right? Anyway, you can just win. Don&#8217;t you have confidence?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Darn it.</em> She was trying to provoke me. I had been trained by Kotomi; I couldn&#8217;t afford to lose any more!</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, I accept that challenge!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in high spirits. I like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>True to her earlier declaration, Momoi chose the dark Axel. I opted for his disciple, Engine.</p>



<p>Engine was a descendant of ninjas and excelled in projectile attacks as a speedy type. On the other hand, the dark Axel had increased power but lost speed compared to before. As long as I could keep my distance, victory would be mine.</p>



<p>The second round began, and I unleashed a barrage of shurikens. This tactic, which had never worked on Kotomi, seemed to have no counter for the beginner Momoi as my character steadily chipped away at her health bar.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s unfair! Come over here!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Declined. This is Engine&#8217;s strategy!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh! I don&#8217;t remember raising a disciple like that! The original story has been lost!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The great thing about Urbat is that you can enjoy a story that is different from the original!”</p>



<p>Although I didn&#8217;t know the original story, I played Engine&#8217;s story mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Engine tried to infiltrate the hideout to rescue his sister captured by Dr. Punk, but Axel stopped him, deeming it too dangerous. The master and disciple then engaged in a battle where Engine emerged victorious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Axel actually lost on purpose. He was unable to go all out against his disciple, whom he secretly considered like a son. The remake of the first part, where Engine expressed his gratitude with &#8220;<em>Thank you</em>, Dad,&#8221; as he left was emotionally moving.</p>



<p>I also loved the scene where Axel rushed to rescue Engine when he was about to lose to Dr. Punk in the hideout. The moment Axel defeated his arch-nemesis and surpassed his master Rocket was genuinely thrilling. At that moment, my sleepiness just vanished.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, I lost! It&#8217;s different from the original!&#8221;</p>



<p>The second round ended in my victory. Despite being distracted by her movements, I could beat the opponent if I concentrated on the monitor.</p>



<p>&#8220;How about that? Did you realize Engine&#8217;s strength now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not sticking to the original story is a disgrace! I&#8217;ll beat you with Oil-chan next!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll be Dr. Punk.”</p>



<p>And so, the third round began, resulting in another win for me. The following fourth and fifth matches continued with victories on my side.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, <em>mou ~</em> ! I can&#8217;t win at all!&#8221;</p>



<p>After my triumphant streak of ten wins, Momoi finally let go of the controller. It was as if I was watching myself being beaten up by Kotomi. However, unlike my past self, Momoi also appeared to be enjoying herself even though she was frustrated.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you angry?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Angry? Why would I be?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been beating you up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no big deal. I&#8217;m just having a good time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you enjoy losing?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course not. It&#8217;s just that losing can be fun too. This is the first time I&#8217;ve played a game like this together.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although she usually played [Life of Farmer] with Kotomi, the term &#8216;together&#8217; here probably meant &#8216;in the same space.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you play games with Takase and the others?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why not? Though I don&#8217;t know about Aoki or Kotobuki, Takase seems easygoing. They would probably join, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They might, but I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;d enjoy it. Aoi-chan only has interest in what she likes, while Ran-chan and Naru-chan prefer physical activities.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They might surprisingly enjoy it if you invite them.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even I, who initially didn&#8217;t expect much from the Urbat game, ended up enjoying it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t invite them. Naru-chan, Aoi-chan, Ran-chan, well, all my friends, none of them are into otaku stuff. If I invite them to play games, they will probably think I&#8217;m an otaku.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But you are an otaku.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am, but I don&#8217;t want non-otaku people to see me as one. If they find out, they&#8217;ll make fun of me…”</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s not true.”</p>



<p>“That happens. Back in middle school, girls used to mock otaku boys.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not saying that everyone will accept otaku hobbies warmly. But Takase and the others aren&#8217;t the type to make fun of their friends&#8217; hobbies.&#8221;</p>



<p>Takase was the one who approached a tough-looking dude like me and said I was &#8216;cool&#8217; with a smile. She didn&#8217;t have any prejudices. As long as your hobbies weren&#8217;t bothering anyone, she most likely would accept it with a smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;But&#8230; it&#8217;s scary to even think about. That&#8217;s why I keep it to myself. Besides, I&#8217;m still having a good time without telling them,&#8221; she said, her cheeks softening with a delighted expression as she looked at me, &#8220;Because you accompany me in my otaku hobbies, Haruto-kun.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, if you invite me, I&#8217;ll tag along. But having two otaku friends is better than one, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true. Ideally, I&#8217;d like to get along with a female otaku too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Only female?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If I get along with a guy, he might start treating me like an otaku princess. I just want to have fun without getting into a romantic situation.&#8221;</p>



<p>In other words, it&#8217;d be okay if they were girls. This was a golden opportunity to help Kotomi make friends.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you know I have a sister?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fujisaki Kotomi, right? Of course, I know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just between us, Kotomi is an otaku too. Can you try to get along with her?&nbsp; I could be the middleman.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s impossible.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Huh, an immediate refusal?</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Do you dislike my sister?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, sorry. It&#8217;s not that. I&#8217;d actually love to become friends if it were possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then why did you say it&#8217;s impossible?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because she doesn&#8217;t seem interested in becoming friends. I&#8217;ve approached her a few times. I invited her to social events, offered to help carry her books, even asked her to be my partner in P.E. But every time, she would look scared and keep her distance.&#8221;</p>



<p>I could vividly picture those scenes. I wondered why Momoi, who was so nice to all the girls, ignored Kotomi, but I guess she was just being considerate. Momoi was indeed a good person.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; sorry about my sister. But she&#8217;s not doing it on purpose. She&#8217;s just incredibly shy. It&#8217;s been that way since elementary school. Kotomi has accepted being a loner, but deep down, she wants friends&#8230; that&#8217;s why I want to help her make some.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re such a good brother.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi looked impressed, but then added;</p>



<p>&#8220;Regardless of what you or I think, unless Fujisaki-san wants to become friends, it won&#8217;t happen.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I get it. Forcing friendship won&#8217;t last. I just want to give her an opportunity to make friends, at least.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, if Fujisaki-san does want to, I&#8217;d like to be friends too&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks. Just hearing you say that means a lot.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi did have the intention to be friends. Now it all depended on Kotomi&#8217;s feelings.</p>



<p>Kotomi had rejected the idea to watch Maison de Night together, not because she disliked Momoi, but because she was uncomfortable around glamorous girls. If I could make her understand they shared the same interests, that discomfort might fade.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome. So&#8230; about the wish, what do you want? Do you want the bento?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No, making a bento is too much trouble, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if you say that, I can&#8217;t help but worry. So&#8230; how about this? Next time we have a study session, teach me English.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks. And, what&#8217;s your request?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, my request is&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps it was an embarrassing request as Momoi lowered her gaze shyly. She peeked at me from beneath her bangs, her blue eyes focused on my reaction.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I want to go to an amusement park.&#8221;</p>



<p>She looked reluctant to bring it up, so I braced myself for an outrageous request, but it turned out to be nothing of the sort.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s unexpected.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;D-did it sounds childish?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not childish, just didn&#8217;t peg you as the type who&#8217;d want to go to an amusement park.&#8221;</p>



<p>With her mature appearance, real otaku nature, and wealthy background—there was a mismatch between the image I had of Momoi and amusement parks.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always longed to go to an amusement park. Have you ever been to one?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;With who?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;With my family, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8230;Oh, right. She mentioned it the other day. Her father traveled around the world for work. It was understandable that she couldn&#8217;t casually ask her busy parent to take her to an amusement park.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why not go with Takase and the others?&#8221;</p>



<p>Even with their club activities on weekends, there should be enough time to go to an amusement park.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get hit on if it&#8217;s just us girls. It was crazy when we went to the beach last year, or when we were at the pool, festivals, or bowling. Although I&#8217;m used to it, I want to play without being disturbed for my first time at an amusement park.&#8221;</p>



<p>In other words, she wanted to avoid pick-up attempts. If that&#8217;s the case, I should definitely go. If I could successfully serve as a men deterrent, maybe I could also tag along to the pool, festivals, or bowling with the rest, doubling as Momoi&#8217;s boyfriend and bodyguard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I really wanted to see Takase in a swimsuit.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s go together!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes! You really are easygoing!&#8221;</p>



<p>With the decision to go to the amusement park, Momoi smiled happily.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>After thoroughly enjoying the internet café, I watched Momoi leave in a taxi and headed straight home.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m home.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I was climbing the stairs, Kotomi appeared from her room. It seemed like she&#8217;d been at home all along, she was still in her pajamas.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome back. How was the offline meeting? Did it go well?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was a blast.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite my initial reservations, today&#8217;s offline meeting turned out to be the most fun compared to the previous two. I might not be inclined to watch a 200-episode anime, but I was open to playing the game version of Urbat again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Here, take this.&#8221;</p>



<p>I handed Kotomi a backpack with the game inside. With this, today&#8217;s mission was accomplished. Returning the backpack lifted the load on my shoulders. I should hit the bath right away and wash off the fatigue.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, by the way, Mom and Dad went to Grandma&#8217;s house. They&#8217;ll be back late.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t in the mood to cook, maybe I&#8217;d make a ramen after taking a bath. Then I&#8217;d go to bed early.</p>



<p>After retrieving my pajamas from the room, I headed to the bathroom. While waiting for the bathtub to fill with hot water, I decided to relax in the living room. As I sank into the sofa, drowsiness gradually crept over me.</p>



<p>&#8220;You look sleepy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just as I was about to drift off, Kotomi&#8217;s voice brought back my fading consciousness.</p>



<p>&#8220;Staying up all night to play games will do that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, how about I give you a lap pillow?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her unexpected suggestion dispelled my sleepiness.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why a lap pillow?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because you look really sleepy. I&#8217;ll wake you up when the tub is full, so go ahead and sleep.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In that case, just let me sleep like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to be so reserved.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about being reserved.&#8221;</p>



<p>We were high school students, for crying out loud. Getting a lap pillow from my sister at this age was embarrassing. It&#8217;d be difficult to fall asleep.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, um&#8230; How about I cook dinner tonight?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No need to go through the trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>I declined not because Kotomi was a terrible cook. She wasn&#8217;t particularly skilled, but she could handle simple dishes—similar to me. Perhaps it was because we were twins or grew up in the same household; our taste preferences aligned.</p>



<p>However, I was exhausted today. I just wanted to eat quickly and get to bed. I hated the time it took to wait for food.</p>



<p>&#8220;In that case, how about I clean your ears?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can clean my own ears.&#8221;</p>



<p>While I was talking, the sound of water filling up the bath reached us.</p>



<p>Seemingly disappointed, Kotomi was left in the living room as I went to the bathroom alone. I quickly shampooed my hair, intending to wash my body when—</p>



<p>&#8220;Haru-nii, I&#8217;ll wash your back!&#8221;</p>



<p>A call came through the bathroom door.</p>



<p>First a lap pillow, then offering to cook, and now this. Today, she was unusually eager to take care of me.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Is she watching too many maid anime?</em> Though it wasn&#8217;t as prevalent now, in the past, she easily got influenced by anime.</p>



<p>She&#8217;d show me illustrations of knights, make me read isekai novels, or even engage with me using her &#8220;Dark Shadow Wizard&#8221; persona. When I pointed it out, she&#8217;d blush and scream, <em>&#8220;Noooo!&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Today&#8217;s pampering might end up becoming a part of her dark history later.</p>



<p>Whether that&#8217;s the case or not, I wished she hadn&#8217;t offered to wash my back. Because it was just plain embarrassing.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine. We&#8217;re already high school students.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m wearing a swimsuit.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;s naked.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have your swimsuit too, Haru-nii. Look.&#8221;</p>



<p>A men&#8217;s swimsuit was pressed against the frosted glass of the door.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you going this far&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because&#8230; I had a dream.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A dream?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. A dream where you hated me. I&#8217;ve been causing you trouble lately, so&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Ah, she was concerned about the offline meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, I was initially irritated that she dumped such troublesome matters on me, but now I wasn&#8217;t really mad. It was a bit of a hassle that I had to learn otaku knowledge to avoid being exposed, but I didn&#8217;t mind hanging out with Momoi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was no need for Kotomi to go out of her way appeasing her brother…</p>



<p>&#8220;Pass the swimsuit.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi was worried that I might dislike her. As her brother, I wanted to help alleviate her concerns. Otherwise, my already introverted sister would become even gloomier when she was at home.</p>



<p>The door creaked open slightly, and a swimsuit was tossed in my direction. I quickly put it on.</p>



<p>&#8220;Can I come in now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I replied, and the door opened tentatively.</p>



<img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/1000010345.png">



<p>Kotomi was in a school swimsuit. Swimming lessons started this week, but due to the school&#8217;s consideration, the lanes for boys and girls were separated.</p>



<p>Moreover, under the watchful eye of the teacher, guys couldn&#8217;t openly stare at the girls—though I did catch a glimpse of Momoi because she stood out, I couldn&#8217;t spot either Kotomi or Takase.</p>



<p>If my sister could fix her posture, she&#8217;d be on par with Momoi in terms of body development. Seeing Kotomi in a swimsuit after several years didn&#8217;t evoke any particular emotions, but it could change the impression boys had of her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Can I wash your back now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Go ahead.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi whipped up some foam with a body towel and began scrubbing my back.</p>



<p>It had been years since I bathed with my sister. Who would&#8217;ve thought I&#8217;d be bathing with her at this age? I should say something since it was awkward if we stayed silent.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you play Urbat well?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I was searching for a topic, Kotomi initiated the conversation.</p>



<p>&#8220;I won all matches except the first one.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, Mahorin won one. Was she good?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not really. She moved on instinct more than skill. I got distracted and lost.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, Mahorin mentioned that. How her body moves on its own. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s related, but she doesn&#8217;t like action games much.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is she more into the slow-life genre?”</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Oh, by the way, did you borrow the &#8216;<em>Shrine Maiden of the World Tree</em>&#8216;?</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in the backpack I handed over earlier. You can play it first.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you going to play it too, Haru-nii?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. If she asks me for my thoughts when returning it, she&#8217;ll be suspicious if I can&#8217;t say anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. I have to ask you when returning it&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;d rather not end up pulling an all-nighter watching anime again, but meeting up is not a problem. In fact, it&#8217;s kind of fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you turning into an otaku too?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not really. Mahorin is a good person, so being around her is surprisingly fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221;</p>



<p>And suddenly, Kotomi looked quite proud. Her reflected face in the mirror was beaming with joy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mahorin is really awesome! She likes the same anime as me, appreciates my analyses, and stays up late talking about anime with me!&nbsp; It&#8217;s not reluctantly; she genuinely enjoys our talks!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You really like Mahorin, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah! I like her! She&#8217;s my one and only friend!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, how about meeting her in person?&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi&#8217;s face in the mirror suddenly clouded.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it because talking face to face makes you nervous?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; also, I can&#8217;t suddenly say, &#8216;<em>I&#8217;m the Jet Black Yasha&#8217;</em> now&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asking you to reveal everything right away. If you&#8217;re okay, I&#8217;ll keep acting as your stand-in.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But&#8230; won&#8217;t you hate it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I told you, didn&#8217;t I? It&#8217;s fun hanging out with Mahorin even though I&#8217;m not an otaku. But I&#8217;m sure Mahorin would enjoy spending time with you even more than with me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi looked down with a troubled expression.</p>



<p>Well, I didn&#8217;t expect an immediate answer. If she could meet Mahorin right away, she wouldn&#8217;t have asked for a stand-in in the first place. Even though she knew that spending time with Mahorin would be fun, nervousness was holding her back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there was a crucial difference between when she first asked for a stand-in and now.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asking you to meet her alone. I&#8217;ll be there with you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unlike before, I could mediate this time. As long as it wouldn&#8217;t be just the two of them, meeting should be doable.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can just start with nods. Talk whenever you feel like it, I&#8217;ll make sure to handle the rest.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But&#8230; won&#8217;t Mahorin feel bothered having me around if I don&#8217;t talk?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not at all. Honestly, I&#8217;ve already told her your personality, and she said she&#8217;d like to be friends if possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve already introduced me to her?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, &#8216;introduced&#8217; is not the right word&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi seemed more positive about the meetup now. Once she met Mahorin, she&#8217;d realize Mahorin was actually Momoi. It&#8217;d be better to inform her beforehand than for her to find out later.</p>



<p>The problem was knowing Mahorin&#8217;s true identity might make Kotomi shy away from chatting.</p>



<p>Although it could be seen as meddling and there was a possibility Kotomi would lose her emotional support, if she could overcome this, she would be able make a real friend.</p>



<p>Momoi was a good person. If they met and talked, they would surely become friends.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kotomi, would you still like Mahorin no matter what kind of person she is?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. Because Mahorin is my friend.&#8221;</p>



<p>That was an instant response. It showed how much she valued Mahorin. If her words were genuine, she should be able to accept Mahorin even after learning her true identity.</p>



<p>&#8220;Actually, Mahorin is Momoi.&#8221;</p>



<p>The moment I revealed it, Kotomi&#8217;s eyes widened. A ripple of shock slowly spread across her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;M-Mahorin is&#8230; M-Momoi-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Th-that Momoi-san?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The one and only.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi was visibly flustered.</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I see. So that&#8217;s why Momoi-san visited our house the other day…”</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I know I&#8217;m being persistent, but really, Momoi is a nice person. That&#8217;s something you probably already know best, right? If you two can be close in the chat, you&#8217;ll get along in person too. You only need a bit of courage.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;B-but&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi&#8217;s eyes wavered with uncertainty.</p>



<p>&#8220;Momoi-san is beautiful, outgoing, has tons of friends, fluent in English, excels in sports, and popular with guys&#8230; The world she lives in is just too different from a plain, introverted girl like me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Different world? I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How can you say that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you and Momoi live together as a married couple in the &#8216;Life of Farmer&#8217; world? Your compatibility speaks for itself over those two years.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Momoi-san and I are&#8230; compatible?&#8221; Kotomi muttered, looking down.</p>



<p>When she lifted her face a bit later, determination sparkled in her eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;ll meet Momoi-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Because deep down, I wanted to go to a collaboration cafe, sing anime songs, and try playing Urbat. I wanted to watch anime together and discuss our impressions.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, absolutely! Once you become friends, you can enjoy all those things together!&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Great. Kotomi had gathered her courage.</em></p>



<p>Even though she was nervous to meet Momoi in person, taking this significant step forward was what mattered.</p>



<p>While it would be ideal to become friends in a single meeting, if Kotomi could reduce her discomfort towards Momoi even slightly, that would be a huge win.</p>



<p>&#8220;So&#8230; when will we meet?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tomorrow.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tomorrow!? That&#8217;s&#8230; pretty sudden, isn&#8217;t it?”</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m going to the amusement park with Momoi tomorrow.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi said there was no rush, but the rainy season was just around the corner. Rain was forecasted for the upcoming weekend, and we couldn&#8217;t be sure about the weather the following week. Beyond that, final exams were looming.</p>



<p>Moreover, the temperature had been rising lately. Tomorrow was expected to be clear, and the temperature wouldn&#8217;t be too high. If we&#8217;re going to the amusement park, tomorrow was the perfect day.</p>



<p>&#8220;But why the amusement park? We&#8217;ve got &#8216;Special Land&#8217; around here, right? Did they do an anime collaboration or something?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t heard about any anime collaboration.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, you just want to have fun at the amusement park?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Does that sound a bit childish?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not necessarily childish&#8230; it&#8217;s just that it doesn&#8217;t quite match the image I have of Momoi-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>I chuckled at Kotomi&#8217;s straightforward opinion.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right? Momoi isn&#8217;t the person you think she is. Sure, she looks flashy, but inside, she&#8217;s an ordinary girl. Oh, and she&#8217;s a hardcore otaku too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Seems like Kotomi&#8217;s concerns about Momoi were somewhat alleviated.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t I be a bother if I tag along?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nope, not at all. I&#8217;ve already told Momoi about you. She said if you decide to come, you&#8217;re more than welcome.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>So, what are you gonna do?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Kotomi looked into my eyes through the mirror.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go &#8220;</p>



<p>She nodded with a firm expression.</p>
