<h2>Prologue: Online Gaming Couple&rsquo;s Chat Log</h2>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m convinced the little sis is the final boss.</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Hmm, I see. That&rsquo;s an interesting theory. The little sis as the final boss concept, I like it!</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Right? Well, it&rsquo;s just a guess. If things go as expected, Schneider would be my bet for the final boss.</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Either way, it sounds exciting! I can&rsquo;t wait for next week!</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> The preview practically guarantees an epic episode! I&rsquo;ll log in right after watching. Let&rsquo;s share our thoughts right away.</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Looking forward to it!</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Alright, I&rsquo;m logging off now. See you tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Ah! Wait a minute.</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> What&rsquo;s up? Still want to chat a bit more?</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Just a bit. Hey Jet Black-kun, do you remember the Driste anime?</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Oh, how nostalgic lol. Dream Stage! That was the summer anime from two years ago, right?</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Yep, that&rsquo;s the one. They&rsquo;ve started a collaboration cafe for it.</p>

<p>Jet Black Yaksa: I know, I know. I checked the menu and it&rsquo;s impressively faithful to the show.</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> You already looked into it! Impressive.</p>

<p>Jet Black Yaksa: I was really into Driste, even sang character songs in the bath sometimes.</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Really?! Which character?</p>

<p>Jet Black Yaksa: MioMio! Once I start with one of her songs, I can&rsquo;t help but sing all of them. I&rsquo;m a MioMio fan!</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> You&rsquo;re getting too excited here lol.</p>

<p>Jet Black Yaksa: My family scolded me for that because I took the bath too long, lol.</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> They must have been worried. Sounds like a nice family. By the way, did you know about the special perks at the collaboration caf&eacute;?</p>

<p>Jet Black Yaksa: Of course, I&rsquo;ve checked them all. The store sticker from visiting is cool, but the acrylic stand is the best. It&rsquo;s an exclusive design and you get it free with orders over 4000 yen! Practically a steal!</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Fans gotta hurry before they run out!</p>

<p>Jet Black Yaksa: Right? The hype might have faded, but there&rsquo;s a lot of die-hard fans, and I&rsquo;m one of them, lol</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Jet Black-kun, have you already been to the cafe?</p>

<p>Jet Black Yaksa: Not yet. I really want those special perks, but going to places like that alone takes some courage. Well, the acrylic stand is tempting, so I&rsquo;m considering it if I can muster the courage.</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Then how about we go together next time?</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Heeey?</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> What happened? Did you fall asleep?</p>

<p>Jet Black Yaksa: Sorry sorry, I was in the bathroom. You mean, going together? Like an offline meeting?</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Yep. We&rsquo;ve known each other for almost three years, and it&rsquo;s been over two years since we got married. I think it&rsquo;s about time we meet in person. What do you think?</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m against it, but considering the collaboration cafe is happening in ten cities nationwide, wouldn&rsquo;t it be more convenient if we went somewhere close to both of us?</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> I don&rsquo;t mind the travel costs, so I&rsquo;d go even if it&rsquo;s far. Jet Black-kun, which cafe is closer to you? Can you tell me the nearest station?</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Hello?</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Jet Black-kun?</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Sorry, sorry. I completely forgot which station is the nearest. I&rsquo;m not the type who uses trains much.</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Got it. Phew&#8230; I was worried I might&rsquo;ve weirded you out by suddenly asking about your nearest station.</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> I&rsquo;m really sorry for making you worry! It&rsquo;s just that I was surprised. We&rsquo;ve been married for two years but you&rsquo;ve never brought up real-life stuff before, so I thought you were one of those people who keep a clear line between gaming and reality.</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> I initially intended to keep it strictly a gaming relationship, but I figured if it&rsquo;s with you, we can enjoy talking even in real life.</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> I see.</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> By the way, do you finally remember the station&rsquo;s name?</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> I doubt it would ring a bell, but it&rsquo;s Kishi Station&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Really!? Amazing! That&rsquo;s near my nearest station!</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> No way! Can this really be a coincidence? But hey, there might be another Kishi Station! Which prefecture is the one you&rsquo;re talking about, Mahorin?</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Well, when I checked, there&rsquo;s only one Kishi Station in the whole country.</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Oh, I see. So, are we really going to have an offline meetup?</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Yup, if you&rsquo;re okay with it.</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> I&rsquo;m totally fine with it! Chatting with you is seriously fun, and I&rsquo;ve been wanting to talk in real life too!</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Really? I&rsquo;m glad I mustered the courage to invite you then.</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Thanks for mustering the courage for me! Thank you so much!</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> &#8203;Oh, but you know, I once saw a web survey asking, &ldquo;Was it worth attending an offline meetup?&rdquo; And the percentage of people who answered &lsquo;yes&rsquo; was zero. Of course, I&rsquo;m all for it, and I think chatting with you about otaku stuff in real life would be super fun. But considering we already enjoy our chats and if the fun in real life and online gaming is equally satisfying, then opting for gaming and saving time on travel might be a more efficient choice.</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> But then we won&rsquo;t get the special perks, right?</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> True.</p>

<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Can we meet on Saturday at 10 AM?</p>

<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Sure.</p>

<p>Translation notes:</p>

<p>The Kanji name is &#28422;&#40658;&#22812;&#21449; which turn to romanji as Shikkoku Yaksa. But I went ahead to translate it as &lsquo;Jet Black Yaksa&rsquo;.</p>
