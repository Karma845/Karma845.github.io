<h1>Chapter 7: Seeds of Rekindling</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">*Step, step, step,
step*.......</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the hospital
attached to the Gloaurum Institution. Shina Juliel and Razward were making
their way down the cold, quiet, white corridor.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Their destination was
a certain hospital room. Once they arrived at their destination, she slowly
regulated her breathing. There was a nameplate on the door with the name of
Nozomu Bountis written on it. She put her hand on the doorknob and opened it
noiselessly. Long black hair could be seen through the gap of the door.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Irisdina-san,
you're here."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh, Shina-kun,
huh......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Despite it being early
in the morning, Irisdina had already visited the hospital room.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">On the table beside
her were trays of replacement bandages and disinfectants, as well as tubs of
clean water and towels. Nozomu, wrapped in bandages all over his body, was
lying quietly on the only bed in the hospital room.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Both Nozomu and Ken
were swallowed by the raging waters, but Nozomu was able to be found.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was thanks to the
communication earring he was wearing.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Originally, it was a
magical device made of a special stone called a curbstone. Combined with the
fact that there was a communication link, they were able to quickly locate him
as he was swallowed by the raging waters.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was also fortunate
that Shina, who had sensed Nozomu's situation, immediately sent Razward to his
rescue.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Razward rushed into
the water supply through the exit from which Irisdina and the others had
escaped. He pushed aside the rushing water with his wind spirit power and
tracked Nozomu. As a result, they were able to rescue him not long after he was
swept away by the waters.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Incidentally, the
water that had flooded up to the water supply managed to be drained out by the
emergency drainage mechanism installed. However, in exchange, the water supply
in the residential area was completely cut off. It was estimated that it would
take more than a week to restore it.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After being rescued,
Nozomu was rushed to a hospital room in the Gloaurum Institution.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And several days have
passed. He still has not regained consciousness.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Irisdina-san,
how is Nozomu-kun's condition......?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"He still hasn't
woken up. At this rate, who knows when he's going to wake up...... Even
Fadrey-dono cannot bring back Nozomu's consciousness."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">According to Fadray,
there are parts of the human body that can be restored to normal and parts that
cannot. This is especially true for the functions related to the head, and he
cannot do anything about this part.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Raz......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Chichichi...... (It's
not working, after all. I can't seem to connect the link directly to wake it
up).]</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina gently placed
her hand on Nozomu's cheek. The heat that gradually transmitted from the palm
of her hand told her that he was still alive.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That's why it was so
frustrating, and sadness stirred deep in her heart.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that moment, the
door was opened and Norn entered the room.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Good morning,
you two. I see you're here again today."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes, I'm sorry,
Norn-sensei, for asking you to do something unreasonable......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't worry
about it. You guys are just concerned about him, right?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu was currently
not allowed to have visitors, and only a limited number of people were allowed
in this hospital room.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This was done on
Jihad's instructions and was a measure to protect Nozomu's safety. Irisdina and
the others were only allowed in this hospital room because Norn, the doctor in
charge, suggested that it was necessary to ensure his safety.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Thank you."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, let's get
on with the morning checkup, shall we? Ah, right. We have someone to assist us
today."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Come in."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As though responding
to Norn's call, the door to the hospital room was opened again.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There stood Lisa
Hounds, one of the main culprits.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">†</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While Norn was
examining Nozomu, the three of them stood side by side and looked at Nozomu
lying on the bed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The only sound in the
hospital room was the clinking and clattering of the examination instruments.
An awkward atmosphere filled the room.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa had been
manipulated by Mefi, so the reason she was in this hospital was to diagnose
whether or not she had any aftereffects of being manipulated by the spirit.
Fortunately, there was no bad aftereffects and she was able to be discharged
from the hospital.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I hear you're
being discharged from the hospital today."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Y-Yeah......
Irisdina-san and Shina-san, have you two been ...... umm ......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes. They've
been assisting with Nozomu's medical examinations. They don't have the
expertise, so they can't do much, but I asked Jihad-sensei for
permission."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-I
see......."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Okay, done. I
don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but there is no change in
his condition. Now we just need to change the bandages. Can you guys give me a
hand?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Hearing Norn's
instruction, Irisdina and Shina approached the bed and turned Nozomu, who was
lying there, sideways.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu suffered
various injuries, both major and minor, during the incident, the worst of which
was the stab wound to his abdomen.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To counter the full force
of Mefi and Ken's attack, he used his treasured sword, [Mumei], to perform a
ritual act of self-inflicted injury. Although he stabbed himself so as not to
damage his internal organs, the wound itself was still deep.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa, you too,
hurry up."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, yes......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Urged on by Norn, who
was putting away the examination equipment, Lisa also approached the bed a step
behind.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But just before Lisa's
outstretched hand touched Nozomu, it froze and stopped.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her breathing became
ragged all at once, and sweat broke out on her forehead. Her hands were
shaking, and one could see her hesitation and agitation at the thought of
touching him.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Irisdina-kun,
Shina-kun, sorry, but can you switch places with her? </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa-kun, help me with
the preparations over here."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"B-But......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You can't do
anything if you're hesitant to touch the patient. Just help me over here."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa's shoulders
slumped at Norn's strong words, as she helped Norn put away the examination
equipment.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Meanwhile, Irisdina
and Shina swiftly changed Nozomu's bandages and even changed the bedsheets.
Lisa watched them with a distant look in her eyes.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa-kun, don't
space out."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, Y-Yes!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even though Norn
warned her to concentrate, Lisa's eyes naturally focused on him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The ugliness of herself
further stirred up her guilt. What shallow feelings I am harboring now, she
thought.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that moment, Lisa's
and Irisdina's gazes crossed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa reflexively
looked away as Irisdina's deep jet-black eyes met hers.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina just kept
staring at her. Her expression was like a Noh mask. However, contrary to her
expressionless face, the depths of her eyes were shaking.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">†</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After Nozomu's medical
examination, Irisdina and Sheena returned to the academy a step ahead of the
others.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa, on the other
hand, was brought to the next hospital room by Norn.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was an empty room
with only two beds, a desk, and two round stools.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Norn gestured for Lisa
to sit down and then she left the room. A few moments later, she returned with
a teapot and two cups.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Sorry, please
stay with me for a bit."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After saying this, she
quickly finished her chanting and invoked her magic. She quickly turned the
water in the teapot into hot water and poured the brewed tea into the cups.
This magic only alters the state of the water in the pot, rather than boiling
it with heat. It was an advanced, yet quite wasteful use of magic.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"When I'm busy
with a lot of things, I tend to become lazy. Well, just pretend you didn't see
it. In return, I'll keep my mouth shut about your morning classes."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a wry smile, Norn
placed a cup of steaming tea in front of Lisa and sat down opposite her.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"U-Umm. What do
you-......"</span></span></p>

talk to you for a bit. You seem to have a lot on your mind."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Being pointed out by
Norn, Lisa looked down. The amber-colored surface of the water reflected her
expression. Her face was as clouded as the dark clouds that covered the sky.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm sorry, I was

to worry about it. Looking after the students' emotional well-being is also my
job."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Norn spoke in a light
tone as she took a sip of her cup.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa, on the other
hand, looked down and seemed unable to even touch her cup.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was understandable.
Even though she had been manipulated by Ken's schemes, she had stabbed her best
friend, and had driven her childhood friend, who had always cared for her, into
such a state.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It would be impossible
not to be tormented.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In fact, she was so
tormented that she even hesitated to touch the unconscious Nozomu.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's true that
there is still a lot of conflict between you two. It's not an easy problem to
solve, but fortunately, both Nozomu-kun and Camilla-kun are still alive. I
think it's still too early to give up in despair."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Contrary to Norn's
concern, Lisa's reaction was not good. She looked down and could not even make
eye contact with her. Her face, reflected in the steamy tea, was stiff and
tight-lipped.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I know you're going
through a lot, but don't do anything rash. If something happens, come to the
infirmary. We can at least talk as a distraction."</span></span></p>

thought that this would be enough to ease her depression.</span></span></p>

continue to reach out to her. Even if she did not respond.</span></span></p>

such a mental state, the best thing that a third party can do is not to leave
them alone.</span></span></p>

on her face, Lisa stood up and turned away, as if to get away from Norn.</span></span></p>

already? Since I went to the trouble of brewing it, why don't you at least

refusal, Lisa left the room.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The door slammed shut
and Norn, left alone, began to put away the tea, which was untouched, with
regret. While placing the cups on the tray, Norn called out to the door.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Come on

silence, the door was opened hesitantly.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In front of the room
stood Camilla Vecnose, a girl with dull crimson hair.</span></span></p>

she was standing firmly on her own feet, it was hard to believe that she had
been seriously injured just a few days ago. The reason for this remarkable
recovery is that the wounds were able to be sealed at an early stage thanks to
proper first aid and the medical treatment provided by the Gloaurum
Institution's advanced magic.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla is a former
noblewoman of the Cremazzone Empire and Lisa's paternal cousin. However, due to
the special circumstances of having fled from the Empire, she was blackmailed
by Ken into helping him to bring down Nozomu and the others.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But you are

to the daughter of her benefactor and her personality, and that was her genuine
intention.</span></span></p>

The reason I couldn't see Lisa earlier or help take care of Nozomu was because
I was scared."</span></span></p>

lived in fear. Even when she was a child, her life was in danger and she was
constantly being hunted.</span></span></p>

she also understood. If there is something she truly wants to protect, she must
not run away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After all, there are
only two ways to go. Either to walk away and never be seen again, or to go see
her, prepared to be chastised.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In her stiffened

Camilla's legs were shaking. Her body was still not completely healed. Even
though she was healed with magic, her lost strength has not yet been restored.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But in her eyes, a
strong fire of will, unbefitting her pale, sickly face, burned brightly.</span></span></p>

Camilla bowed deeply to Norn.</span></span></p>

time since Camilla has felt such an uplifted mood. Smiling at each other's
lighthearted comments that leaked out unintentionally, Camilla quietly left the
room. Her steps were steadier than she had expected.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After seeing her off,
Norn was left alone in the empty room and looked down at the cup that was left

street to the academy like a tortoise. She stopped again and again, feeling
guilty as if someone was pulling on her back, and each time she would start
walking again and again to shake off her self-loathing. Eventually, the school
building of the academy drew nearer.</span></span></p>

deployment of guards for a major arrest. There was no way it could be kept
hidden, and everything but the most classified information had already been
made public. The fact that a considerable number of people were injured in the
process also became public knowledge.</span></span></p>

gossip. Unwitting malice. Considering that she is allowed to come to the
academy, one should be able to guess that the city's public safety organization

Such words were almost bursting out of her throat, but she bit her lip and
swallowed down the words that kept welling up in her mouth. She knew that even
if she tried to argue, the people around her would not listen to her. She knew
that very well. After all, she herself was one of them before.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, she had

they did not say anything as bluntly as the underclassmen, the piercing stares

gazes of those around her, Lisa took her own seat and, turning her head
downward as if to escape, simply waited for the time to pass.</span></span></p>

The teacher's voice and the sound of quill pens scraping paper echoed through
the third-grade, second-class classroom.</span></span></p>

morning classes, Shina's mind was elsewhere.</span></span></p>

Irisdina, she kept her composure relatively calm.</span></span></p>

was linked to stop him from going out of control during the battle with [Cracked-Crown
Giant Centipede] is still intact. Normally, that path should have disappeared
long ago, but Shina kept pouring magic power into it, little by little, so that
the people around her would not notice.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The path opened little
by little, absorbing the magic power like withered plants drinking water. As
she did so, color faded from Shina's vision, the sound faded, and then she fell
into a pitch-black, silent space.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A darkness that would
make a normal person feel uneasy. She proceeded through it without hesitation.</span></span></p>

the magical path. She gently expanded it, as if she was opening a closed flower
petal. The first thing that reached her was Irisdina's emotions which acted as
an intermediary.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Longing, frustration,
and self-loathing toward oneself. Shina involuntarily pressed her chest as she
caught a glimpse of the negative emotions that had been piling up since he fell
into a slumber.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(I knew it,

heart ached when confronted with Irisdina's emotions, but then she switched her
mind and headed further down the magical path.</span></span></p>

...... Her heartbeat raced. And the darkness pulsating in tandem with it.
Eventually, with the sensation of breaking through the clouds, her vision
cleared at once.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What caught her eyes
was the azure sky and the mirror-like shining surface of the lake. In the
cloudless blue sky, several strands of lines were running in a fan shape.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She followed the lines
cutting through the sky and walked along the surface of the lake, aiming beyond
the horizon. As she kept moving forward, trailing the ripples that emerged with
each step, the shape of the lines in the sky soon became clearly visible.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Chains with a dull
luster. It was a network of chains that stretched to the end of the sky without
any support.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The chains, which were
growing denser and denser, were stretching toward a point on the horizon.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Upon closer inspection,
she could see that the chains were also extending beneath her feet before she
knew it. Heavy, dull, and shiny, yet somehow not overbearing. She headed toward
the end of it.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And finally, Shina
reached the source of the countless chains.</span></span></p>

chains, perhaps a dozen times bigger than Shina's body.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A cluster of steel
rings, overlapping one another, layer upon layer. A faint light was leaking
from deep within.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She touched the sphere
of chains. A warmth, unlike that of metal, was felt in the palm of her hand.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You're here,

Nozomu's presence at the end of the chains. Shina looked up at the chain sphere
once again.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Fine, I'll wait

letting the warm yet cool sensation on her back soothe her.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She could see his
heart through the gap between the chains. Sensing Tiamat's presence and danger
in her soul, what she feared most was that Nozomu's spirit would be devoured by
the giant dragon.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But Nozomu's spirit is
safe. It is just sleeping. She breathed a sigh of relief at this fact.</span></span></p>

the chains on her back made her feel lonely.</span></span></p>

even though he was near. He won't look at her, and he can't hear her voice.</span></span></p>

irresistible desire welled up. Even if he doesn't answer her, she wants to stay
here forever. ...... She can't get his smile out of her head.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah......."</span></span></p>

words of her best friend resurfaced in Shina's mind.</span></span></p>

with humidity. A young man was lying on a platform in a dark, dimly lit room
lit only by candlelight. It was Ken, who had been swallowed by the raging
waters of the previous incident and had gone missing.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His face was pale and
he looked like a corpse. However, his chest, which was rising and falling

him.</span></span></p>

supposed to have already lost interest in Ken. But then, in the depths of its
glassy, inorganic eyes, lit up with interest at the slight possibility that Ken
had shown.</span></span></p>

shadow pulled out a box from his pocket and placed it on the table.</span></span></p>

seamless, square box.</span></span></p>

traced the top surface of the box, where the boundary between the upper lid and
the lower box was not discernible, with a finger lit with magic power. At
first, he moved his finger slowly in a circular motion, then swiftly moved it
in a second time. Then, a letter resembling a [</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">ト</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">] appeared, and the top surface opened like a blooming
flower to reveal a brilliantly colored stone.</span></span></p>

the stone, which radiated an extremely colorful radiance.</span></span></p>

stone against Ken's chest and smiled with satisfaction at the sight of the
stone as it greedily consumed the Qi, magic, flesh, and soul of the dying Ken
in front of him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The colorful stone
sunk into Ken's cold body. The stone ate through his skin and ribs, and when it
was halfway into his body, Ken, who had been in a comatose state, opened his
eyes.</span></span></p>

resistance to the foreign object entering his body, the stone was able to
burrow deeper and deeper into his flesh. Like a parasite devouring the flesh of
its host.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And just the other
day, she was about to leave the city after ten years of fun, but she was
stranded in an unexpected place.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In front of her was a
drainage canal leading out of the city. A small amount of magical power is
being emitted at its exit to prevent demonic beasts, but as a supernatural
being, she should be able to breach it without any difficulty.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, for some
reason, Mefi repeatedly walked right and left in front of the emitted magical
power.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Eventually, she
willingly jumped into it, but her body was repelled as if she was being
obstructed by an invisible wall.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[It's designed so that
only I can't get through. This is definitely that guy's work......]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As if reacting to
Mefi's irritation, her compound eyes turned red.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What flashed through
her mind was the person who had been Ken's backer so far. He was one of the
most powerful people in the city, but at the same time, he was an anomaly whose
mind Mefi could not read at all.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He looked down at Mefi,
an existence rarely seen by humans, with inorganic eyes, not even seeming
surprised when he saw her, and was the first person she thought, [I don't want
to be involved with this person].</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[What a jerk!]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She exploded her own
source elements out of frustration that things were not going the way she
wanted them to. The flowing wastewater splashed out and cracks spread across
the surrounding walls. The magic circle for releasing the magical power was
also cracked, but there was no change in the released magical power.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It seemed that
something other than the magic circle on the wall was still functioning.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, from the back of
the passageway that Mefi had passed through, the sound of someone's footsteps
echoed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The time was already
midnight. It was not the time for workers to visit the canal.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mefi slowly turned
around to see who was approaching from behind, and then let out a surprised
cry.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Hee, what a surprise.
You're still alive, huh?]</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"............"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There stood the toy
that Mefi had played with for ten years and then discarded.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His faded blond hair.
His uniform was in tatters, and he cast his eyes down, so it was impossible to
see the expression on his face.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But Mefi was surprised
to see that the toy was still alive, her mouth twisted into a grin as she
transformed herself into a little girl.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Huh? Are you perhaps
mad at me? But it's your fault for being weak and stupid, you know? If you
think of it normally, there is no way a spirit would lend its power to a mere
human, ahahaha!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">　</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></span></p>

was distorted hideously and she let out a vulgar laugh.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The reason she went to
the trouble of changing back into human form was to thoroughly humiliate Ken.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Combined with the
irritation that had been building up earlier, her voice was completely tinged
with her hideous true nature.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[But it's just
perfect. If I borrow your body, I can slip through this damned barrier.]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Right now, she was
blocked by the magical power being released into the canal, and she was unable
to leave the city. But if she could get into this toy body, she might be able
to use it as a cover to slip through.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Besides, I was
getting irritated. Since you're here, why don't you let me hear you scream to
kill time?]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In a bit of
mischievousness, Mefi suddenly turned her palm toward Ken and released the
source element. She wanted to stimulate Ken's sense of pain and enjoy the sight
of him writhing in pain as he was being assimilated.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The released source
elements instantly enveloped Ken and increased his sense of pain 10,000-fold.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The pain was so
intense that even the strongest of minds would succumb in an instant. The water
spirit's eyes lift up in excitement at the thought of the former contractor,
whose face would be contorted in anger, wet with tears and snot, and thrashing
about on the ground in an ugly manner.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[......Huh?]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Immediately after, the
source elements that had enveloped Ken were scraped away. Unable to comprehend
the scene that had just flashed before her eyes, Mefi let out an involuntary
gasp and let her gaze wander between her hand and Ken's.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Did I make a
mistake?</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"> A momentary doubt crossed her mind, followed by an indescribable chill
running down her spine. Something was wrong. As if to shake off her doubts,
Mefi once again released her source elements toward Ken.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken, on the other
hand, opened his mouth wide in the face of the onrushing stream of source
elements.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Aaa~! His mouth opened
like a child taking a big mouthful of candy, and then closed with a loud
*clunk! sound. At the same time, the source elements that should have been
approaching Ken disappeared again.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[W-What the heck is

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While Mefi, having
been shown the unbelievable sight twice, let out a cry of fear and agitation,
Ken's mouth moved in a mawkish motion as though he was chewing. It was a bizarre
behavior for a human being.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And then, *ooze*......
dark particles of light oozed out of Ken's body.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was as if all the
world's poisons had been boiled and concentrated into a dark sediment.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[A!?]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The moment Mefi saw
this, the chill that had been running down her spine swelled up. Her fake face
was stained with surprise and fear, and she rushed to distance herself from
Ken, trying to flee at once.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I won't let you

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But Ken caught up to
her in less than a second. The back fist he shot out struck Mefi hard.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The strike, clothed in
a foreign source element, slammed her small body against the wall, inflicting
intense damage on the supposed spirit. Along with a short scream, new cracks
were carved into the damaged wall.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[A, gah......, wait,

influence of the source element exuding from Ken, Mefi wobbled and trembled.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She sounded weak, a
sharp contrast from earlier, but Ken mercilessly dismissed her pleas.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Shut

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A carelessly swung
down knife-hand slashed both of Mefi's legs from its base.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A screech like ripping
silk echoed through the drainage canal, and the lesser water spirit collapsed
on the spot. From the base of both slashed legs, pale source elements spurted
out like blood and scattered into the dim darkness.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Furthermore, Ken
grabbed Mefi's wings as she screamed in extreme pain and threw her directly
against the opposite wall.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Aa, gi.......]</span></span></p>

throw ripped off the wing that had been grabbed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mefi skipped over the
waterway and slammed into the wall again, literally gasping for breath.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken's mouth contorted
into a grin at the sight of the dying spirit that had tricked and deceived him,
and he crushed the remnant of the wing in his hand. But that smile of delight
soon disappeared.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm,

in a childlike manner and looked down at Mefi's legs, which were lying on the
floor. Her legs, which had been cut off, still retained their original shape,
though the source elements that made up her body were scattered about. Ken then
picked up one of the shiny blue legs, threw it into his mouth, and began to
chew.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">*Munch-munch*,
*chew-chew* ....... The eerie sound of chewing flesh and bone echoed through
the drainage canal.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">*Gulp*....... He
gulped and smiled in satisfaction. He devoured another leg as well and walked
closer to Mefi, who he tossed over to the other side of the canal.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Between them was a
fast-flowing stream of water. Ken, however, did not pay the torrent in front of
him any mind and proceeded on his way. Under normal circumstances, he would
have sunk into the stream of water and been swept away to drown.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But instead of
sinking, Ken's feet stayed where they were, as if the torrent had never
existed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">*Splish, splash,
splish, splash*...... Ken continued to move quietly through the vigorously
flowing water, as if he were walking on shallow water.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, standing in
front of the fallen Mefi, he picked up her small body.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Stop...... Forgive

The trembling of her body and the pleas that followed. Ignoring all of them,
Ken bit into Mefi's body head first.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">*Crunch, crunch,
gulp*....... Ken devoured Mefi's body in the blink of an eye, as though he were
eating a small grilled fish. At the same time, the black miasma exuding from
Ken's body thickened in color.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa,

his two childhood friends, Ken threw himself into the flowing water stream.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His body disappeared
into the murky current. All that remained was the sound of the rushing water,
echoing through the canal.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>‡</strong></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After finishing her
morning classes, Lisa was alone, making her way to the back of the school
building. Leaning her back against the building, she sat down. She cast her
eyes downward and exhaled heavily, her stiffened body and mind relaxing just a
little bit.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No matter where she
was on the school grounds, there would always be a contemptuous look directed
at her whenever someone was around. Combined with the continuous gossip behind
her back, her heart grew increasingly despondent. That was why she wanted a
place where she could be alone, even if only for a little bit.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She raised her head
and looked up at the early summer sky. It was a blue sky without a single
cloud. The wind caressing her cheeks felt pleasant, but at the same time, her
heart was once again dyed a gloomy color.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu has been

Lisa raise her head reflexively.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From the shadows of
the school building, six people, five boys and one girl, stared at Lisa with
creepy expressions.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What do you guys

that they were students from the third to fifth classes of the third grade. The
girl with the highest rank among them stepped forward with her arms folded.
Lisa recognized this girl. She had been in the first class until her second
year.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her name is Bellaluna
Haltim. She is a member of the Cremazzone Empire's Count family.</span></span></p>

wicked smile, and feeling a chill, Lisa stood up and tried to hurry past them.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It is about your

I believe he died about ten years ago. Aren't you curious about what he was
hiding from you?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa choked up, and
the days of traveling with her parents when she was a child flashed back to her
mind.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was before she
traveled to the Oire village. Her parents, active as adventurers, had protected
many travelers, and they appreciated them for it. Lisa was proud of them, and
she wanted to be like them someday.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But then, her father
died. She did not know why. But the figure of her father, etched in her mind as
a child, remained, and eventually, she and her childhood friends left the
village and came to Arcazam, the place her father had talked about.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Looking at you,
you really don't know anything, huh? Neither about your own situation nor about
that cousin of yours."</span></span></p>

her father's death. However, she had been told by Inda-sensei that Camilla was
her cousin, but only after she had escaped from the sewers.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her memories of the
time she was being manipulated have also been restored. However, it did not
mean that she had fully accepted everything that had happened. Even after two
weeks, she still could not shake the feeling of being suspended in mid-air. As
if to disguise her own sense of ambiguity, Lisa asked for more of her father's
story.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......What about

Leanback Hounds, was originally the fifth son of the Arwent family, a frontier
Earl of the Empire. He was even offered to be a son-in-law to a Duke's

Arwent family is a frontier Earl bordering Lake Krausamari, the largest lake on
the Arkmel continent, and one of the most prominent families in the Empire.</span></span></p>

that honor and fell into exile. I don't know the reason. But his name was
erased for disregarding the wishes of his family and the other party. Ten years
later, his sister, who was three years younger than him and was supposed to be
married into another family, followed the same path as his brother and had her
name erased as well."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"And that sister

Camilla Vecknose's mother. Apparently, they had been close siblings for a long
time."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her father's past that
she had never known before. She felt her heart beat faster as she heard this
story.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Even though you

no, Lady Lisa Arwent. If you don't mind, would you like to come with us to the
Empire?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was, without a
doubt, an invitation to go to the Empire.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was an unexpected
offer. While invitations to go to a country as a post-graduation career path
are not uncommon, this invitation was different. What Lisa was being offered
was a chance to return as an aristocrat.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I can't ......

gentle expression disappeared and she grabbed Lisa's hair. Her crimson hair was
pulled with such force that it ripped apart with a snapping sound.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ouch!"</span></span></p>

out an involuntary scream, the girl swung her around and slammed her into the
wall of the school building.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The men around her
were also surprised by Bellaluna's actions. However, Bellaluna dismissed their
hesitation with a single sentence, and with a wave of her hand, she ordered
them to restrain Lisa.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Mmpph!"</span></span></p>

Lisa to the ground and held her limbs down, Bellaluna activated a
sound-isolating barrier.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well then.
Sorry, but I'll have you come with me. A shameless girl who has abandoned her
name as a noble of the Empire and moved to the countryside."</span></span></p>

in turmoil, Lisa reflexively yanked off the male student who was holding her
right leg and kicked him in the jaw. She then kicked the student holding the
left leg at the side of his head with her right foot.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With two of the four
students eliminated in a matter of seconds and the other two flustered, Lisa
tried to move her body to break free of the restraints even further, but.......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Give me a break

by Bellaluna struck Lisa directly in the abdomen, ending her momentum of
resistance.</span></span></p>

electrocuted and unable to move, the men around her held her down again.</span></span></p>

couldn't comprehend what Bellaluna was saying. Seeing Lisa like this, Bellaluna
looked at her with a look of utter dismay.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You really don't
know anything, huh? The Arwent family, which had fought against foreign enemies

This affirmed Bellaluna's words even more.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't ...... you

so she couldn't chant any spells properly. Since that was the case, she decided
to let her magic run wild and blow them all away. Rushed by fear, Lisa intended

disarray, the magic she had garnered fizzled out. Her whole body seemed to
freeze, and she lost the strength to resist.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Bellaluna's mouth
lifted up upon seeing Lisa's eyes widen and stiffen.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a sadistic smile
on her face, she kept sprinkling words like poisonous incense on her.</span></span></p>

robbed Lissa of any energy she was about to muster in her attempt to resist.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The light in her eyes,
which had been wide open, faded away in the blink of an eye.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh, you've gone

you, no? I don't like her."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a
"Hmph!", Bellaluna glanced at Lisa with a disgusted look in her eyes.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Bellaluna is a member
of the Empire's Count household, but her position is the lowest. She is
practically no different from a commoner. She was treated the same way at her
parent's house, where she was left in a shed at the edge of the mansion without
a servant.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her arrogant tone of
voice was born from her obsession under such circumstances.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The same was true for
the men around her. Although they are nobles, their right of succession is even
lower than the fifth and sixth sons, and they have been treated as almost
non-existent.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That was why they
sympathized with Caskell, who was also dissatisfied with being sent to Arcazam,
and cooperated with him. Behind the scenes, they leaked information about
Arcazam to the Empire and their own parents' house without permission, which
brought them to be watched by Starlight.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I won't let

shadow jumped out from the side and swung the staff in its hand toward
Bellaluna.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She dodged it by
ducking slightly and looked a little startled when she saw the intruder.</span></span></p>

a physical strengthening spell on herself, Bellaluna easily stepped into
Camilla's bosom and slammed a powerful palm strike into her lower abdomen.
Camilla's diaphragm convulsed and she crumpled to the ground, temporarily
unable to breathe, gasping for air.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"As I thought,
you can't use most magic except for auxiliary magic. What's more, the effect is

the others were about to pull Lisa up and take her away, a sharp voice rang
out.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Bellaluna, who had her
arms crossed and her smile contorted, reflexively turned around, and upon
seeing the person who had called out to her, her face stiffened. The male
students who had been holding Lisa down also stiffened their entire bodies as
if they had been struck by lightning.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There, in front of
their gazes, was a girl of the same grade walking toward them with the setting
sun shining down on her back.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her jet-black hair
fluttered in the wind, casting a shadow of the same color over them.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Irisdina

gaze shot through Bellaluna, then to the male students around her, and finally
to Lisa.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her uniforms were
blackened and scorched. Irisdina's brow furrowed at this painful sight.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In sync with her
emotions of contempt and anger, a black magic power exuded from her body. Given
her usual self-controlled nature, it was hard to imagine that this thick rage
was surging from her entire body.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Sorry, but could

anything, a magic bullet was shot forth, smashing the ground at her feet.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Bellaluna
involuntarily yelped at the scattering dust.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Seeing her like this,
Irisdina let out a derisive chuckle.</span></span></p>

experienced various challenges would not be perturbed by something at this
level. Especially if they are aware that they bear the name of nobility. In
that sense, Bellaluna is not worthy of being a nobility.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">First of all, they
claimed that it was done in the interests of the Empire, but as far as the
story went, the punishment of Lisa's father and Camilla's mother was supposed
to have been fulfilled with the revocation of their peerage and noble names.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To punish them
excessively would in turn tarnish the authority of those in power.</span></span></p>

Bellaluna and the others' arbitrary decision to kidnap Lisa. Their foolishness
was evident in the way they acted on school grounds, the poor barrier they set
up, and the fact that they made contact with their target on their own.</span></span></p>

shake off the ugly darkness in her mind.</span></span></p>

dark-colored magic bullet into her stomach, forcing her to shut up. Oddly
enough, the scene was like a rehash of Bellaluna and Lisa's earlier scene.</span></span></p>

the magic bullets from the moment she shot them, and continued to fire
follow-up attacks. The bullets landed one after another, and in the midst of
the dust and smoke that danced about, screams like ripped silk were heard.</span></span></p>

all the fired magic bullets were used in actual combat. If she was hit
directly, they were powerful enough to break her bones.</span></span></p>

girl with light yellowish-green hair carrying a staff also appeared.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She is Irisdina
Francilt's best friend and the person with the greatest magical power of her
generation.</span></span></p>

top three students in the school year caused the men's faces to turn purple.</span></span></p>

run away. Shi-jou is currently furious. If you're not careful, you'll get two

lapis lazuli-colored spirit also appeared to block their retreat.</span></span></p>

Razward replied in a light tone, he took the captured students away.</span></span></p>

definitely a crime. No matter how they tried to make excuses, they would not be
able to escape expulsion. Perhaps they might have to eat stinky food in jail
for a while.</span></span></p>

off, Irisdina looked at Lisa. She was still recovering from the shock, and her
body was trembling slightly as she fixed her disheveled uniform.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"T-Thank,

furrowed involuntarily as she heard these words of gratitude.</span></span></p>

felt a dark emotion welling up inside her. She tightened her mouth to resist
it, and then turned on her heel without saying a word.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......You're not

threw such words at Irisdina's back.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina's shoulders
trembled as she turned around.</span></span></p>

as lead and as cold as ice. Her eyes were filled with rage as she gazed back at
Lisa. Her shoulders were tense in anger, moved toward Lisa and grabbed her by
the collar.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't be

Lisa at a distance that was so close that they could almost feel each other's
breath.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa's eyes widen at
the sight of Irisdina's agitated state, which is out of character for her
normally calm demeanor.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tima and Shina, who
were watching what was going on, also looked surprised. Even Tima, who has
known Irisdina for the longest time, had never seen her in such a fit of rage.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But what good
would it do to say it? Even if I say it, it won't wake Nozomu up!
Besides-......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It would be against
his wishes. Irisdina was about to say so, but her expression froze, and she
fell silent.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The curses that had
leaked out. The reproachful words she had uttered.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She intended to remain
silent. She thought that only he, of all people, had the right to blame her. To
begin with, Lisa was also one of the victims. She was only deceived by Ken and
Mefi.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But she couldn't stand
it. The sight of Nozomu continuously sleeping overlapped with her mother who
had died a debilitating death, and her own heart couldn't bear it.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"U~, uu~!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shocked by her own
actions, Irisdina bit her lip, but the sobs she could not suppress began to
spill out of her tightly closed lips. Seeing her like this, everyone present
was rendered speechless.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"~!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina abruptly
pushed Lisa away and turned on her heel to run.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tima called out to her
without a second thought, but Irisdina did not stop and disappeared into the
shadows of the school building.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Tima-san.
Leave this place to me and go after Irisdina-san."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"U-Un!
Alright!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina took a quick
glance at Tima and urged her to chase after Irisdina.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tima was looking
around, wondering what to do, but then nodded at Shina's words and started to
run after Irisdina.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After seeing Tima off,
Shina walked over to Lisa, who had flopped to the ground and remained stunned.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Good grief, I
know you're not a fool either. What did you want to achieve by saying such a
thing?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"............."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa hung her head and
remained silent in response to Shina's exasperated voice. While sighing at her
behavior, Shina began treating Lisa's wounded body. For a while, only the
sounds of healing magic and applying bandages were heard in that place.
Eventually, after she finished treating her, Shina opened her mouth again.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Since no one
punish you, you wanted us to at least blame you ......  Is that right?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps Shina's
assessment was spot on, Lisa's lips clenched into a tight line.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, I
understand how Irisdina-san feel. But we were not with him when he was going
through his most difficult time, and you and Nozomu-kun both fell victim to the
same circumstances. If anyone can blame you then, it's only him."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina's words were
only met with silence.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Besides, he
never wanted that in the first place. Your actions are nothing but an act of
disrespect towards his feelings."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa herself knew,
even if she did not say it. She knew that there was no point in doing this, and
she knew that Nozomu wanted her to get over it.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She was happy that
Nozomu was thinking of her, but envied Irisdina and the others who could be by
his side, and felt ashamed and miserable that she had failed to believe in him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa suddenly raised
her gaze at the elf girl beside her. The wind blowing in the evening breeze
felt ethereal, and the eyes that gazed back at her were filled with a strong,
warm light.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She looked into the
depths of those eyes and saw the color of the yearning she once had for him as
well. She was a little envious of the elf girl who could be so straightforward
about her feelings for him.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You like Nozomu,
too, huh?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Ue!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina suddenly let out
a strange, high-pitched cry, and Lisa tilted her head.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Am I
wrong?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"N-No, it's not
wrong, but ...... you can tell?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah ......
Because I-."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">I liked him,
too</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">. Without saying those words, Lisa swallowed them down with the guilt
still swirling in her chest. Sheena said nothing to Lisa, but instead let a
mischievous smile appear on her face.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Maybe the reason
I can talk about it so straightforwardly is because I have the least feelings
for him. It was only recently that I realized I was attracted to
him......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Watching Shina like
this, Lisa inwardly wondered, "What is she talking about?".</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even though she
realized her feelings late, she firmly understood Nozomu's intentions and was
trying to support him. Her actions spoke more eloquently of her feelings than
ten thousand words.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A-Anyway! If you
really care about Nozomu-kun, you'd better stop acting rashly. You don't want
to betray him again, do you?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina's snow-white
cheeks turned vermilion as she spoke, and Lisa nodded her head in a small but
clear gesture.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I have
betrayed Nozomu so many times. As that female student said, I may no longer be
worthy to be by his side.</span></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But I don't
want to betray him anymore. I don't want to disregard his feelings.</span></span></i></p>

fire in Lisa's heart.</span></span></p>

then. Camilla-san, I leave the rest to you, okay?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh?"</span></span></p>

stunned voice as she was suddenly asked to take care of the matter. Lisa's gaze
also turned to her.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">An awkward atmosphere

worry about it. After what happened earlier, I'll stay a little further away
just in case."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla thanked Shina
as she was leaving the place. And when she reached a reasonable distance where
Lisa's and Camilla's figures were hidden among the trees, Shina suddenly
crouched down on the spot, holding her face.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ugh, I'm so

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Not only her cheeks,
which peeked out from between her fingers, but also the tips of her ears were
stained bright red.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"L-Like, she
says....... Other people have found out that I like Nozomu-kun. Auu, I'm so
embarrassed......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She had just recently
become aware of her love for Nozomu, and now her feelings for him were suddenly
revealed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Wrestling with the
awareness of love and shame, Shina shook her head so much that it almost
snapped her neck a thousand times. Each time she did so, her long azure hair
would bounce like a wagging tail.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As the silent trees
stared down at her, the elf girl continued to writhe in agony.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She just kept running.
As if to escape the urge to rip out her own chest.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With her ragged
breathing, she headed for the medical facility of the Gloaurum Institute, where
he slept.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She opened the front
door with a force that could have destroyed it and dashed into the white
corridor.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oi, stop right
there!"</span></span></p>

Wha, wait!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The facility's staff
members widened their eyes upon seeing the beautiful dark-haired girl running
at such a high speed, but Irisdina paid no attention to them. She ignored the
guards who tried to stop her, and even Inda's voice as she passed by.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When she reached
Nozomu's hospital room, she opened the door violently.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The room was shrouded
in silence. On the bed, Nozomu was still sleeping peacefully.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He was breathing
softly as usual.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa, haa, haa,
haa... Nozomu." </span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina walked over
to the bed, not bothering to calm her rough breathing.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As his name leaked out
of her mouth, it melted away into the quiet of the hospital room.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">*Creak, creak* .......
Her heart was creaking. She squeezed her chest and bit her lip as if to endure
the pain that ran through her. The white hands turned even whiter and wrinkles
were carved into the clean uniform.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Come on, wake
up. You've been sleeping a little too much, you know? If you don't get up soon,
you'll have a hard time keeping up with the class."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The aching did not
subside. Instead, it seeped out of her chest like a leaking rain.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a hoarse voice,
she shook Nozomu, who was lying on the bed. But there's no reply......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Somia, Shina,
and the others are worried about you, too. And, and......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The smile that she
managed to put on her face was distorted into an ugly smile. Trying to escape
the pain that stirred in her chest, she kept rocking the sleeping Nozomu.
Although she tried to hold back her tears, her uncontrollable emotions
continued to overflow.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wake up, please
wake up......! Let me hear your voice......!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her mind replayed the
memory of her childhood, when she clung to her mother, who had passed away and
become a mere husk.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The image of her
mother on her deathbed and the image of Nozomu sleeping overlapped. Exceeding
her limits, Irisdina's eyes became moist and a single tear trickled down her
cheek. She could not suppress it anymore.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Gu~. Uu.......
Uuu......!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tears flowed like a
broken dam, and Irisdina clung to Nozomu's chest. She squeezed the futon so
hard that she could almost tear it off, buried her face in it, and sobbed
incessantly.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a dry clicking
sound, the hair ornament Nozomu had bought for her detached, and tears streamed
down to wet Nozomu's chest. When she raised her face, she saw his sleeping face
right beside her.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His face has no
particular distinguishing features. But when he smiled, she felt warmth from
the bottom of her heart. But now.......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hic, hic .......
Nozomu......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Bringing her face
closer and gently touching Nozomu's cheek, she pressed her own lips against
Nozomu's.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">First kiss.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She recalled the time
when they fought the Cracked-Crown Giant Centipede. Shina kissed Nozomu to calm
him down when he went out of control.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just wanting Nozomu to
wake up, Irisdina kept pressing her lips against his.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, her wish was
in vain, and Nozomu's eyelids did not open.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The hair ornament that
fell on his chest caught her attention.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was the gift he had
bought her the first time they walked the streets together.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The pain that was just
welling up deep within her chest suddenly disappeared. All that remained was a
gaping hole and a fierce chill.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"............"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina gently raised
herself up and left the hospital room in a daze.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She walked through the
corridor with unsteady steps and went straight outside.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was already dark
outside. A chilly breeze caressed her cheeks.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ai!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Tima......?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Suddenly, she was
hugged from behind. The familiar voice of her best friend was calling out
Irisdina's name.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even though the name
was being shouted in her ear, the voice sounded somewhat distant.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Why are you
here......?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A question came out of
reflex amid her not-so-well thought process. Tima did not answer but kept
hugging her as if wrapping her from behind.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm okay. I'm
...... perfectly okay."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She repeated the same
words as if parroting them back, but her choked voice had no power, no
persuasive power at all. Tima's arms tightened as if to comfort Irisdina, who
looked as if she would break at any moment.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't worry,
everything is fine .......uu~"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The warmth rekindled
Irisdina's frozen emotions.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At the same time, the
tears that should have dried up began to well up again. Tima shifted her body
and wrapped Irisdina's face in her chest as if to hide the sobs that were
beginning to leak out.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Uuu~, aaa~

of her best friend, Irisdina began to weep again.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The surrounding people
cast their eyes at her to see what was going on, but she was no longer bothered
by such things.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Guu~, uu~!

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ai......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tima just kept hugging
the weakened Irisdina and accepting her raging emotions.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">How anxious had she
been? How much vexation had she been holding back?</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her heart was nearly
breaking at the thought of the person she loved not waking up, and she was
jealous of that person's former girlfriend. She tried desperately to suppress
those emotions ...... but failed.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her best friend, the
one she could always count on. The only time she showed such weakness was when
the butler of the Waziart family almost took her sister's soul, which was
dearer to her than her own life.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She must be so
attracted to him that she felt so stirred emotionally like this.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(Ah......)</span></span></p>

this, the sound of footsteps rushing toward them came from the end of the
hallway.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When Tima turned her
eyes toward the direction of the sound to see what was going on, Inda, who
should be observing Nozomu's condition, came running toward them. As Tima
tilted her head at the somewhat desperate figure of Inda, she was hit by a
strong chill.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-What!?"</span></span></p>

source elements. It was coming from the forest area of the central park. It was
originating from the place where Lisa and the others had just been.</span></span></p>

their entire body. They looked at each other and ran toward the source of the
power.</span></span></p>

two cousins remained silent as they faced each other.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla's gaze wavered
as she searched for the right words to say, and Lisa remained downcast, not
even looking at the other party's face. In the silence, the only sound was the
night wind rustling the trees. Camilla was the first to speak.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm
sorry......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The words of apology
were so faint that they were drowned out by the sound of the wind, but they
carried a heavy toll as though she was squeezing them out of her mouth.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The moment Lisa heard
it, she became furious.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"~! Why, Why
now......!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her face turned bright
red and she reflexively grabbed Camilla by the collar.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For two years she had
been deceived, and as a result, she kept humiliating the person she loved with
her own hands.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her guilt and remorse
toward Nozomu whom she had hurt indelibly. Lisa went straight to slam Camilla's
body into a nearby tree with all her might.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ugh ....... I
know that no matter how much I apologize, I will never be forgiven. I did
something that cannot be undone. To you, Lisa, and to Nozomu, as
well......."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's too late,
everything, everything is ruined! Everything!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla choked up at
the impact on her back, but continued to speak.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa, on the other
hand, couldn't have been more devastated, her eyes widening and filling with
tears as she pushed Camilla further into the tree. The magic power in response
to Lisa's fury envelops her body, naturally enhancing her physical abilities.
Camilla's body began to creak and scream.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that moment, a
cold, sticky sensation spread across her abdomen.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa dropped her gaze
and saw a red stain that had seeped out from under Camilla's clothes and stuck to
Lisa's uniform.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That was where Lisa
had stabbed her. The disgusting sensation of her hand piercing flesh came back
to her and she reflexively pulled her hand away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla crumpled to
her knees. But her face was still firmly facing forward, looking up at Lisa.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey Lisa, do you
remember? The first time we met at this school. At first, I used to give
everyone I met the cold shoulder. I came to this city to hide myself after
all......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Fear has imprinted on
her since childhood. The only person she could rely on was her mother. Because
she grew up in such an environment, Camilla has always been lonely.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Fortunately, her
mother gave her letters and the necessary knowledge. However, her loneliness
became even stronger when she came to Arcazam. Although her grades were high,
she was naturally isolated from the other students in her class.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In this situation, it
was only Lisa who approached her.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I recognized you
right away. You're uncle's daughter. You had eyes just like his. Kind, strong,
and full of curiosity......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From then on, the two
became close enough to be called best friends.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Because Lisa did not
know her father's origins, Camilla could not tell her that she was her cousin.
But how much support did she receive from Lisa, who had the same eyes as her beloved
uncle and had no hesitation in becoming an adventurer?</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her personality has
not changed, as she is inevitably wary of strangers. She has always been afraid
to talk about her origins. Still, thanks to Lisa, Camilla's world has gradually
grown. But .......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm the one who
blinded you. If it helps you get back on your feet, I'll do anything.
So......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla, sitting on
the ground, stared at Lisa with pleading, yet strong-willed eyes. Lisa averted
her eyes away from such a gaze.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla had the resolve
and strength to do so, which scared Lisa, and at the same time, she felt
miserable about herself for being so shaken up.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa,
wait......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Stay away from
me!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla reached out
for her, but Lisa unintentionally shoved her away. The impact further opened up
the wound in Camilla's abdomen. The crimson color spreads. The sensation of
stabbing someone is getting worse.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa's face froze and
her body trembled upon seeing Camilla involuntarily hold her lower abdomen. She
then tried to turn on her heel as if to run away .......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Please, don't
run away. It's fine if you want to hurt me. But please. Don't run
away......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla's fading plea
stopped her in her tracks. When Lisa turned around fearfully, Camilla stood up
on shaky legs and slowly walked over to her. Then she extended her hand and
hugged Lisa.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's okay,
everything will be okay......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla hugged Lisa
with her weak hands and slowly, really slowly, began to stroke Lisa's hair. Her
gentle movements were like a mother comforting her daughter. Lisa's eyes
widened and her trembling body slowly began to relax.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm so sorry.
And thank you......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Upon hearing these
quiet, gentle words in her ear, Lisa finally reached her limit, and tears
trickled down from her eyes. Emotions overflowing like a raging stream. She
began to weep in an inarticulate voice.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"U~,
~......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No matter how hard she
clenched her teeth and tried to suppress the tears, they wouldn't stop. The
pent-up emotions that had accumulated in the depths of her chest were being
washed away. For a while, Lisa just kept crying.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, at that
moment, a low, raspy third-party voice drifted into their ears.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Found, you
......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The voice made them
turn around reflexively. From the depths of the darkness peeking through the
trees, a figure emerged.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was a blonde-haired
young man wearing the uniform of the Solminati Academy. His entire body was
drenched with water, and his face was downcast with no expression visible.
However, there was a strange aura emanating from his entire body.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A black shadow like a
mirage. It covered Ken's entire body and swayed like a mirage every time he
took a step forward.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ken......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As Lisa was stunned by
the appearance of her childhood friend, who appeared with a strange aura, a jet
of pitch black source element suddenly erupted from Ken's body. The murky
source element, reminiscent of the muddy stream of sewage, swirled and rose
into the sky.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken, who had been
downcast, raised his face. His wide, crimson eyes fixed on the two of them.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, an arrow flew
from the sky. Shina, who had been waiting nearby, rushed to their aid.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The arrow was easily
knocked down by Ken's arm, which was swung carelessly.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Meanwhile, Shina's
eyes widened at the strange presence that Ken was giving off. It was the
presence of an abominable being that she herself knew very well.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This is that
evil beast's...... both of you, run!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla, reacting to
Shina's voice, took Lisa's hand and ran away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, as if to
block their way, a huge white wall of light rose up from the ground.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The translucent wall
towered in a circle, trapping Ken, Camilla, and the others inside.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This is, a
barrier!? (Raz, can you hear me!?)"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(Shi-jou, what the
hell is going on?......)</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Suddenly, black source
elements erupted from Ken's body and swallowed the three of them in an instant.</span></span></p>
