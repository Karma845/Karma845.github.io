<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jihad-sensei is
quite capricious, huh? That guy might be a bit lucky and managed to survive the
Special Comprehensive Exercise, but there's no way he'll ever be a match for a
hero like Jihad-sensei, no matter how hard he tries......"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A section of the
waiting area, protected by a barrier of light. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the place where the
1st-class had gathered, Ken was snickering as he looked at Jihad and Nozomu,
who were facing each other.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Next to him, Lisa
gazed at Nozomu standing in the arena with an empty expression on her face.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"In the first
place, it's strange that that lousy bastard was chosen to be Jihad-sensei's
opponent. It's as if that bottom-feeder qualified to be the representative of
our grade."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, you can
say that again......"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Even this
morning, he suddenly ambushed me in the girls' dormitory, just like a stalker.
I wonder why he hasn't been expelled yet."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa's cold words were
uttered along with her lifeless gaze. The other students around her began to
whisper and make a fuss over her words, all of which were generally in
agreement with Ken's words.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Certainly, Nozomu's
reputation was briefly swayed by his attempts to confront Lisa before the
Special Comprehensive Exercise, but it soon fell to the ground again. This was
the result of Mefi's manipulation of Lisa's memories of the Spasim Forest.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A dark glee welled up
in Ken's chest.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, if one were
to say whether he was able to completely ruin Nozomu's reputation ...... it was
not the case.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......What a
load of crap."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The buzzing atmosphere
was cut short by a dignified voice.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The attention of the
surroundings then focused on the owner of the voice, Irisdina.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"B-But,
Irisdina-san. Lisa-san is his childhood friend, so-......"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"How many of you
here have actually spoken to him? How many of you know who he really is? Even
she, as his ex-girlfriend, doesn't know who he actually is."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">One classmate spoke up
timidly, but Irisdina brushed off her words without even making eye contact.
Her eyes were fixed on Nozomu, who was in the arena, and they were filled with
intensity and light, something that Lisa, who was being manipulated by Mefi,
lacked.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Complete trust and
immense credibility. She paid no heed to others' frivolous talk. Seeing her
appearance, all the students who had been gossiping fell silent.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The tension increased.
Inevitably, the atmosphere of the place turned vague and ambiguous.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken gnashed his teeth
inwardly at the reaction of those around him.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Recently. Especially
after the recent Special Comprehensive Exercise, whenever Irisdina and the
others heard bad things about Nozomu or rumors that had been circulating, they
kept denying them.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As a result,
gradually, the number of students who began to doubt the rumors spread by Ken
has been increasing again.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(But this is just the
right time. Let’s make him unable to recover himself here. Mefi......)</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(Sure~~, but I can't
do much with this girl's mental restraints, is that okay?)</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(No problem, as long
as we can make it look like an accident, that's all that matters.)</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(I'll leave it to
me......~!?)</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, right after
hearing Mefi's words, the image of a blue-haired elf girl and a small lapis
lazuli-colored bird popped into Ken's mind. They were with Nozomu when they
fought against the [Cracked-Crown] Giant Centipede. Apparently, they were
keeping an eye on them. This meant that he could not use Mefi's power. Ken
clicked his tongue and gave up on the idea of conducting a backstage operation
here.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He then turned his
attention to the two standing in the center of the arena with his arms crossed.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A confrontation
between a hero and a student. Almost everyone who came to this Martial Arts
Garden, including the rest of the students, let out a disappointed sneer at
Nozomu's lack of reliability.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But Ken was aware of
it. Nozomu, facing Jihad, was bewildered, but not nervous.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In his mind, the scene
of his abominable childhood friend fending off the [Cracked-Crown] Giant
Centipede resurfaced.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken gritted his teeth
to stifle the frustration that was rising up within him.</span></span></p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>‡</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad stepped forward
and completely killed the distance that had been open in an instant.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">An ultra-fast flash
step, reflected in his enormous amount of Qi. A perfect step with no hint of
any movement.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The great sword swung
downward from above and fell toward Nozomu's head at such an extraordinary
speed that it was hard to believe it was being controlled with only one hand.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu twisted his
body and shifted himself out of the sword's trajectory. The sword strike flew
past him and grazed his cheek.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the next instant,
the muscles in Jihad's arm bulged, and the blade of the great sword slashed out
horizontally.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"~!?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As soon as he could,
Nozomu bent his upper body while leaning backward.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The blade grazed his
chest, popping the buttons of his clothes and leaving a single tear in his
uniform coat.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With cold sweat
running down Nozomu's cheeks, Jihad drew back his great sword, which he had
flung out further, and released a thrust.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A gust of wind
accompanied the thrust, and in an instant the tip of the sword was right in
front of Nozomu's eyes.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu, however, did
not show any signs of weakness. He relaxed his knees as he crouched down.
Jihad's great sword passed right over Nozomu's head. Nozomu slammed the sheath,
which still held the katana within, into the belly of the great sword. Then,
while Jihad's right arm was still fully stretched out, Nozomu slid into his
feet.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hm......!?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Sei!"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu unsheathed his
katana and drew it. He ran past Jihad and delivered a sharp slash to Jihad's
exposed flank.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">*Clang!* Along with a
high-pitched metallic sound, a hard feeling was felt back on Nozomu's arm.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His slash was blocked
by the tower shield that Jihad deftly slid into place.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The tower shield is a
huge curved shield. It boasts overwhelming defensive power, but because of its
weight and poor maneuverability, it was not originally intended for use in such
one-on-one battles.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Despite using such a
shield, Jihad's defense was surprisingly swift.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nuuun!"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad rushed forward
with his shield at the ready. He swung his greatsword at Nozomu with a mighty
force befitting his outward appearance. Nozomu, although in an unstable
posture, attempted to deflect Jihad's slash by raising his katana.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Gah!"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The moment the katana
and the greatsword made contact, a powerful shock struck Nozomu's entire body.
It was a pressure he had never felt before. He managed to prevent the blade
from making a direct hit, but there was no way that Jihad's offensive would end
with just a single sword strike.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ugh......!"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A huge shadow loomed.
Nozomu, still staggered backward, was directly hit by a blow from the tower
shield.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While his vision was
distorted by the impact of being hit and slammed to the ground, Nozomu
desperately moved his body and jumped back. Immediately afterward, Jihad's
greatsword pierced the ground where he had fallen.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You dodged it
well."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa, haa......
I'm used to being blown away......"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Penetrating sword-Qi
and a sense of tension. The overwhelming difference in ability, shown in the
few moments of attack and defense.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A smile naturally
appeared on Nozomu's lips. Seeing him like this, Jihad's cheeks loosened slightly.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You seem to be
enjoying this."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I see, so it's
subconscious. Nevertheless, you have a good eye. You also have a great instinct
for reading the flow of battle. You are a good swordsman. As expected of the
great swordsman's last disciple."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"T-Thanks......"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But it's not
enough. Show me a little more. Here I go."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With those words as a
signal, an unbelievably vast amount of Qi was concentrated at Jihad's feet.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A blast resounded
through the air. Jihad, having once again activated his [flash step], rushed
toward Nozomu once again.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Zei!"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The greatsword was
swung out at a speed so fast that it was hard to believe it was a one-handed
swing.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu ducked with a
gliding body movement, but the barrage of slashes kept on coming.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A combination of a
backhanded right cleave, a downward and upward slash, a diagonal slash, and a
thrust.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">These are all based on
accumulated experience and solid technique. The harmony of his blessed physique
and swordsmanship woven by his unrelenting training, he quickly drove Nozomu
into a corner.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Kuh......"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu focused his
concentration. Predicting his opponent's movements based on his line of sight
and the movement of muscles throughout his body, Nozomu devoted himself solely

remained at the school was not because he wanted to be praised. Nor did he want
anyone to appreciate him. He was just simply running away.</span></span></p>

able to withstand Shino's reckless training was, at its core, an escapism. It
was not a reason to be praised. But the honest praise from someone who is
called a hero and respected by many struck Nozomu's heart.</span></span></p>

filled Nozomu's heart. But he shook his head. He has not yet given it his all. As
if to say so, Nozomu swung his katana with all his might and intercepted the
approaching greatsword. He stepped forward at once.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmm!?"</span></span></p>

disappeared.</span></span></p>

had already seen the technique once, lowered his own waist before Nozomu could
get under him, pressed forward, and launched an upward kick.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu's momentum was
stopped before he could slip under Jihad's armpits, and he was almost pushed
back at once in the opposite direction.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Fuu......."</span></span></p>

no pushover. Instead of forcibly resisting the intense pressure on his entire
body, he spun his body halfway around while keeping his left foot in front of
him. He then circled around to Jihad's rear by letting Jihad's kicking momentum
flow through his body.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, with their back
facing each other, Nozomu picked up the scabbard strapped on his sword belt
with his left hand and pointed the butt of the scabbard at Jihad's back. The
katana, which had been held in his right hand, spun and pointed toward the
scabbard</span></span></p>

behavior sounded an alarm in Jihad's intuition. Based on his years of
experience, the war hero turned around and slid the tower shield between
himself and Nozomu.</span></span></p>

inserted blade combined with the explosion of Qi caused Jihad to almost drop
his shield.</span></span></p>

for Nozomu. Using [Breaking Strike]'s momentum, Nozomu rotated his body like a
spinning top while keeping the katana in its sheath. He then poured his Qi back
into the blade he had sheathed, sharpening it to the extreme.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad, on the other
hand, forced his numb arms to move, readjusted his shield, and infused an
enormous amount of Qi into it.</span></span></p>

the tower shield and exerted pressure on Nozomu as if a huge wall had been
erected. The way he stood with both feet planted firmly on the ground and his
shield poised, it was as if he was saying, "Come at me!", and
eloquently expressing his determination.</span></span></p>

escaped from Jihad's mouth. The tower shield was supposed to have enough Qi in
it to protect against even advanced-tier magic. But despite this, the shield
was easily damaged.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Seeei!"</span></span></p>

surprised, Nozomu threw a returning strike. The reverse strike once again
carved a scar on the shield.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Kuh......!"</span></span></p>

screamed accompanied by dancing sparks, Jihad raised the greatsword in his
right hand. If this continued, the shield would be destroyed. Then the only
thing to do is to render the opponent incapable of combat before the shield is
destroyed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Fortunately, the
advantage of using a shield and a sword is that the attack and defense can be
switched instantly. Nozomu, now mounted on a clear offensive intent, would not
be able to immediately parry as he had done earlier.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad decided to outdo
his opponent's next attack and slam his greatsword the moment the katana was
being swung out. Jihad also determined to make a fatal blow, and readied himself
for Nozomu's third attack.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, at the next
moment, Jihad's attention was dyed white by the swelling sword Qi beyond the
shield.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-What the

out from behind the shield, caught sight of Nozomu, who was pointing the tip of
his katana at him and holding it up as if he were drawing a crossbow. His sharp
eyes caught Jihad, who was hiding behind the tower shield, and the blade he was
holding up had extremely compressed Qi which was incomparable to anything Jihad
had ever seen before.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A chill ran down
Jihad's back. It is a defensive instinct that creatures feel when they are in
danger. It is a feeling that death is close at hand, a feeling that has not
existed since he came to this academy, but that he had felt as a matter of daily
routine twenty years ago.</span></span></p>

the sharpened blade was released. Like a flash of lightning, the thrust
approached the tower shield in a straight line.</span></span></p>

the shield toward Nozomu and raised his greatsword as if to interrupt the
trajectory of Nozomu's blade as it was being thrown at him. The tip of [Mumei]
locked on the center of the cross-shaped scar on the shield, and at the same
time, the Qi-blade, sharpened to the utmost limit, was released.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A figure overcoming
the past and looking forward. A small fire was lit in the chest of a girl who
had been consumed by the darkness of despair.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Unaware that his
friends were trembling with fear at the killing power of the [Core Piercing]
they were being exposed to, Nozomu simply let out a sigh of exasperation.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"He is unharmed,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad emerged from the
dancing remnants of Qi and shattered pieces of metal. Although there were
numerous scratches and cracks on the greatsword in his hand, he himself has no
noticeable wounds.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Due to its nature, the
penetrating power of the [Core Piercing] was reduced when the Qi-Blade
exploded. In fact, Nozomu's[Core Piercing] exploded in front of the greatsword
raised by Jihad, and as a result, it was unable to penetrate his defenses.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"My shield was
pierced, and even my sword was shattered, huh? Looks like I'm getting
old."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nevertheless, the
damage done to the greatsword was serious. The Qi-blade that exploded at close
range had deeply gouged its thick blade.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad threw away the
greatsword, whose blade had been cruelly gouged out.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The blade, which had
reached its limit, snapped in half the moment it fell to the ground.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad, who looked
apologetically at the now-shattered greatsword, suddenly looked down at the
armor he was wearing. The silver-white mithril armor had numerous scratches on
it caused by the aftermath of the [Core Piercing].</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Moreover, it's

his face, Jihad patted his armor. The clacking sound drifted through the quiet
Martial Arts Garden. Jihad himself probably did not expect to have his weapons
shattered and his armor scratched by a student. In fact, not only Irisdina and
the rest of her classmates, but also the distinguished guests in the spectator
seats, the upperclassmen, and even the teachers were not entirely prepared for
this outcome.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I never expect

hand, was already using one of the most powerful techniques in his arsenal. He
had unleashed three different types of Qi-jutsu in a row, and yet Jihad was
able to survive unscathed. As expected, Nozomu was feeling a little depressed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To make matters worse,
Nozomu had consumed a lot of Qi in the battle so far, and he was beginning to
feel a sense of weariness in his body.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He cursed in his mind
that it would be nice to at least inflict a scratch on his face, but then he remembered
that he was dealing with a master-class monster and let out another sigh.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'll have to

the huge black sword [Jaw Drop] that was thrust into the ground.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shivers ran through
Nozomu's body. The sense of urgency that he felt in his body made him shake off
the weariness that enveloped his entire body, and he moved toward Jihad at
once. He then swung his katana without hesitation.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, just when it
seemed that his katana would reach Jihad's body, his figure suddenly
disappeared from Nozomu's vision.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A flash cut through
the air.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"~, above,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu looked up and
saw Jihad literally leaping through the sky.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The destination of his
leap was his treasured sword.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For a moment, Nozomu
was transfixed by the impossible leap of a person wearing full body armor, but
quickly regained his composure and fired a Qi-blade toward Jihad's landing
point. The Qi-blade, which flew through the air, landed with perfect timing just
as Jihad was about to plant both feet on the ground.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... No good,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, Nozomu's
Qi-blade never caught Jihad's body. Although the timing was perfect, Jihad
grabbed the hilt of the [Jaw Drop] as soon as he landed, and slipped into the
shadow of the giant sword while pouring in his Qi.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The giant sword, which
has survived long battles alongside the heroes of past wars, easily repelled
Nozomu's [Phantom], which could easily cut through even steel, and stood tall
without a scratch on it.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmm, you sure

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With an impressed
tone, Jihad haphazardly pulled the [Jaw Drop] from the ground and lightly swung
it as if to check its condition. With that alone, Nozomu felt the wind pressure
as if his body was being pushed.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Alright."</span></span></p>

way to the tip of the giant sword. At that moment, [Jaw Drop], which had been propped
up on the ground as if it were a spectator, became a definite participant in
this battle.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad's gaze was
suddenly directed at Nozomu. His sharp eyes were reminiscent of a bird of prey
and along with the [Jaw Drop] in his hand struck Nozomu with a much stronger
sense of intimidation than before.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The fighting spirit
that incomparable to anything he had ever felt before. While cold sweat was
running down Nozomu's spine, Jihad suddenly lifted the giant sword in his hand.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The iron mass, which
was bigger than the user's height, was easily raised like a twig.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The scene was so
unrealistic that even Nozomu was momentarily taken aback.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Nnn!"</span></span></p>

and activated his Flash Step. The speed of Jihad coming straight at Nozomu was
so fast that it was hard to believe that he was carrying such a gigantic sword.
The [Jaw Drop] was swung downward from overhead.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A sense of danger ran
down his spine, prompting Nozomu to jump to the side as quickly as he could.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The giant sword sliced
through the air and struck the ground with a thunderous impact. The impact was
transmitted throughout the arena with a deafening sound.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The pseudo-trees
shook, and a cloud of dust and smoke, blown up by the impact, engulfed Nozomu,
blocking his vision.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Having lost sight of
Jihad, Nozomu tried to focus his concentration and desperately tried to calm
his mind.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The flow of wind felt
by the hairs on his skin, the sound of the ground he stepped on, and the minute
changes in the dust and smoke reflected in his field of vision. Using all the
techniques he had cultivated in that forest, he searched for signs of jihad.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"............"</span></span></p>

center of gravity at all and despite feeling his own katana, which was
gradually becoming heavier on his arm, Nozomu waited patiently for the moment
when his opponent would make a move.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Time passed quietly. A
buzzing sound rang in his ears.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The moment Nozomu's
foot on the ground slightly ruffled the scattered gravel, the wind shifted.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With the slight sound
of the earth being stomped on, a mighty Qi exploded behind him. Then, something
roared out and came at him from the side.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Kuh!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Instantly, Nozomu
crouched so low that his body touched the ground. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Immediately after, a
huge iron mass passed over his head. The shredded air ruffled Nozomu's hair and
stirred it violently.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu looked up to
see Jihad wielding the huge iron block. A cold sweat broke out on his forehead
as he faced the crushing weight of the mass.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A blow swung with
enormous mass. A mere single strike made Nozomu, who was under the influence of
ability suppression, realize that he was not even allowed to confront it. Then
.......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haaaa!"</span></span></p>

crushing blows, Nozomu immediately took a step forward.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Given his inferior
physical capabilities, it would be impossible for him to escape from Jihad's
range of attack. However, it was also impossible for him to parry the blow as
he had done in the previous exchange of blows. If that were the case, he would
have no choice but to counterattack so as not to be swallowed up by his
opponent's momentum, even if it meant consuming what little Qi he had left.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hou~!"</span></span></p>

step forward, Jihad's eyes lit up as he said, "As expected".</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Most opponents falter
before the intimidation of [Jaw Drop] and lose their will to fight when they
witness its power.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But Nozomu, without
the slightest hesitation, struck back. How many people could actually do that,
even if they knew it was the only way?</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a smile on his
face, Jihad drew back the huge sword he had just swung and held it up like a
shield.</span></span></p>

which had overcome hardships with him over the years, caught Nozomu's blade
unscathed.</span></span></p>

two or three times while swearing at the unreasonably sturdy[Jaw Drop].</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu's blades,
infused with Qi, slashed at the giant sword, drawing trails of light, but the
[Jaw Drop], with its extraordinary weight and sturdiness, and also infused with
an enormous amount of Qi, repelled all of his attacks.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Still, Nozomu swung
his blade to stop Jihad from moving. He had no choice but to keep swinging.</span></span></p>

sword he had raised. Nozomu's slashes kept on coming forth. In the midst of
these, Jihad chose one among Nozomu's many slashes and repelled it with a
Qi-infused palm strike. The powerful impact almost made Nozomu drop his katana.</span></span></p>

a blade that can easily cut even metal in two.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, Jihad was
able to do so with the vast amount of Qi he possessed, his eyes and experience
on many battlefields, and his precise judgment. As Nozomu's eyes widened in
surprise, Jihad reached out, grabbed him by the chest, and threw him into the
air.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Kuh!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu was left
defenseless in mid-air, and [Jaw Drop] swung right toward him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a spine-chilling
sense of intimidation, Nozomu frantically tensed every muscle and rotated his
body as the huge blade loomed in front of him. He then slammed his katana into
the side of the [Jaw Drop], as it was swung down with full force.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Sliding sideways due
to the recoil, Nozomu managed to escape the slashing trajectory of the giant
sword.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Immediately after, the
giant sword smashed into the ground, sending a shockwave that scattered in all
directions and blew Nozomu away.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ugh!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu, without a
moment's pause after his successful hair's breadth avoidance, quickly stood up,
taking a defensive stance.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa, haa,
haa......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Rough breathing
escaped from his mouth. It was not from nervousness, but purely because his Qi
and body were approaching their limits.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's about time.
I should say that you've done very well, but it seems that you are nearing your
limit."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was no way the
veteran warrior would have missed such an opportunity.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The [Jaw Drop], which
boasts of being bigger than Jihad's height, continuously attacked Nozomu.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was nothing to
hold back now. Using the mass and inertia of the huge sword, he handled the
sword as if it were a part of his own body, and even if the sword slammed into
the ground, he would still be able to forcefully deliver a series of blows,
gouging out the ground as he did so.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This sword dance is
made possible by his extraordinary strength and Qi, as well as the vast
experience he has gained on the battlefield.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While Jihad wielded
the [Jaw Drop] sometimes like a beast, sometimes like a fluid dance, Nozomu's
movements were noticeably slower than in previous exchanges. His body was no
longer able to move freely. On the contrary, Jihad's slashes gained even more
momentum.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa, haa......
kuh!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Every time the huge
sword gouged out the ground, scattered stones and debris slammed into Nozomu's
body, and his breathing became ragged due to the rapid consumption of Qi. The
Qi-blade attached to the katana also began to flicker unsteadily like a
flickering torch.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Finally, his limit
arrived.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Suddenly, his knees
gave in, his body staggered, and his movements came to a halt. The next moment,
a huge black mass loomed in front of him.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Kuh!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu quickly threw
himself out of his crumpled position and rolled on the ground to duck under the
giant sword.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad's [Jaw Drop]
passed above his head with a thunderous sound. Feeling the gust of wind that
the giant sword generated throughout his body, Nozomu managed to get to his
feet and tried to raise his katana.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But the moment Nozomu
looked upward, he saw Jihad's fist plunging deeply into his abdomen.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Gaaah!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu's eyes widened
and a muffled cry escaped his mouth.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The impact of the blow
to the abdomen caused Nozomu's body to momentarily lift off the ground.
Continuing on, Jihad infused his Qi into the striking fist and released it. The
Qi exploded in close proximity and blew Nozomu away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu, who had blown
away through the air, was repeatedly slammed to the ground, and finally stopped
when he hit the magic barrier at the edge of the arena.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ga, ah, ugh

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Collapsing on his
face, grunting and groaning, Nozomu exerted himself with both arms in an
attempt to raise his body.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But against his will,
his arms trembled weakly like a newborn fawn.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa, haa,
haa......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He managed to raise
only his upper body, and his body was already at its limit. His breath was
ragged, and he could no longer even think properly.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And then, the worst
situation occurred.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A torrent of Qi
erupted in the arena like never before. Nozomu, with a look of shock plastered
on his face, saw Jihad staring at him with a huge sword raised in the air.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Both feet hammered
into the ground crushed it, and the bulging muscles of his entire body made a
creaking sound inside his mithril armor.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The huge sword he held
up was filled with an enormous amount of Qi that made Nozomu himself feel like
a grain of mustard, and it glowed with a dazzling light.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu's instincts
rang a loud alarm, and his heart pounded so fast that it felt like it was about
to burst.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Qi converging on
Jihad's huge sword, raised in the air, seemed to be surging as if it would
explode at any moment.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Faced with this
clearly abnormal sight, Nozomu put all the strength he had left into his legs
and tried to leap away from the place.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, Nozomu's legs
refused to move according to his will, and he fell to the ground, crouching in
place.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then Jihad swung his
[Jaw Drop]. A huge Qi-blade, so huge that it completely enveloped Jihad's body,
especially for a heavy fighter, was released toward Nozomu.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">[Qi-jutsu</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">・</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Single Strike]</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is the only
technique that Jihad has named by himself. It is a simple strike of putting Qi
into the blade and swinging it down, but Jihad's strike with an extraordinary
amount of Qi transforms such a simple slash into an ultimate sword strike.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As if to say that no
need for any unnecessary tricks, the Qi-blade sped in a straight line, crushing
everything in its path into tiny pieces. It has a power that surpasses even
Tima's all-out magic.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Crap......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The moment the
Qi-blade was released, Nozomu knew that it was impossible to avoid it
completely.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Qi-blade was
surrounded by surplus Qi leaked from the Qi-blade itself and a vacuum blade.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even if he could avoid
the Qi-blade by a hair's breadth, he would still be torn apart by the swirling
Qi and the vacuum blades.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Kuh!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even so, Nozomu tried
to resist, squeezing out his remaining Qi and focusing it on both legs in front
of the [Single Strike] that was already in front of him. He threw himself to
the ground, enduring the dizziness and weariness that assailed his entire body.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The next moment, a
shockwave struck him, blasting his body into the air.</span></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The gigantic Qi-blade
destroyed three of the four-layered magic barriers installed in the arena.
Immediately afterward, the spectators' seats were struck by a shock as if they
had been hit by an earthquake.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Eventually, the
billowing smoke cleared up, exposing the arena to the public. Everyone was
speechless at what they saw.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A deep scar was carved
into the ground. The artificial trees were toppled outward, and most of them
were shattered.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And on top of the
collapsed artificial tree, there was the figure of Nozomu. His body, which had
slumped down, did not move even a twitch.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah......."'</span></span></p>

Lisa's mouth. Her eyes were wide open and her face was pale.</span></span></p>

been assimilated into Lisa, was shaken, Lisa's emotions, which she had been
desperately trying to contain, erupted. Lisa's whole body went cold as if she
had fallen into an icy lake, and only her heart was beating rapidly.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A,

the ground. Seeing this figure brought back memories of her father's death in
Lisa's mind.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He had turned white

hand and ran. His pleading-like voice and the noise buzzing in her head were
distant now, and she forgot all the anger, sadness, confusion, and conflict
she'd felt toward Nozomu.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If I don't

quenched the overflowing impulse.</span></span></p>

of Lisa's emotional breakdown, intensified her interference with Lisa's psyche.
She quickly sealed up the memories that Lisa was about to recall along with the
emotions.</span></span></p>

were filled with turmoil, once again caught Irisdina and Shina as they tried to
rush to Nozomu.</span></span></p>

she spun around on her heel and tried to get back to Ken and the others.</span></span></p>

single tear began to well up from her glassy, vacant eyes.</span></span></p>

tried to rush toward the fallen Nozomu, but their way was blocked by the last
magic barrier surrounding the arena.</span></span></p>

desperate cries, Inda ran her finger across the control panel of the magic
barrier. Norn, the infirmary doctor, was standing by the barrier with a

were anxiously waiting for the barrier to be lifted, restlessly pacing left and

collapsed, got up on his own feet, albeit dazed and unsteady.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The uniform he was
wearing was blotched with red spots in several places, and his forehead was
bleeding unceasingly, perhaps caused by a rather deep cut.</span></span></p>

speechless, Jihad's mutterings were heard in the silent arena.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The extreme Qi-blade
ran past Nozomu's side, only to blow his body away. Jihad intentionally missed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, with such
power, the aftermath alone was more than enough to inflict damage. The vacuum
blades that clung to the Qi-blade ripped through Nozomu's body, and the violent
storm certainly severed his consciousness.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But instead of losing
consciousness, Nozomu stood up on his own feet.</span></span></p>

danger, literally ingrained in his bones, moved his body precisely in the realm
of reflex, where there was no room for thought. In that brief moment, he discerned
the gap between the vacuum blades that clung to Jihad's [Single Strike] and
twisted his body forcibly into it.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So stubborn

been so, he would not have become a legendary dragon slayer, and he would not
have been able to defeat one of the Six Bad Omens.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But even if the
current Nozomu is still not really at his full strength, from Jihad's point of
view, this student is already out of the norm.</span></span></p>

of admiration akin to dismay, but Nozomu, on the other hand, did not have the
luxury of responding to the praise.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His whole body
trembled, and his vision began to darken and narrow. He could not hear well.
His senses were no longer functioning properly due to his exhausted Qi and the
damage he had sustained.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The mock combat

through the arena. All those who had been watching this mock combat let out a
deep exhale.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was such a fierce
battle that everyone present forgot to even breathe.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But Jihad still did
not sheathe his treasured sword and did not turn his eyes away from Nozomu.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu, too, clutched
his bloodstained scabbard, sheathed the katana he held in his right hand, and
lowered his waist.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu Bountis!

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Inda's voice echoed
through the arena as though scolding him, but Nozomu did not respond to her
voice at all.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu, with his
outstanding concentration, has his entire attention focused on the powerful man
standing in front of him. He is also in an extreme state of exhaustion due to
the rapid consumption of Qi and his injuries. He is subconsciously shutting out
all information that is irrelevant to the battle.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even if he had heard
it, however, Nozomu would not have backed down.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was not only about
Lisa and Ken that he had been turning away from. He has also been turning away
from the school itself. In fact, Shino once pointed this out to him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But now that he has
decided to face Lisa and the others, he must also face this school as well.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If so, I must

sight of the invisible chains wrapped around his body. As he gripped the
chains, he noticed Irisdina and the others rushing toward the arena.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Their eyes were moist
with worry. He felt sorry for making them look that way, but he was also
overcome with a sense of joy.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even though Tiamat had
misled him, to the point that he had once turned his blade on them with the
intent to kill them. And yet, they are still concerned about him. Just by
knowing that alone, he felt power welling up from deep within his body. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I don't need
to use this power after all.</span></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu then let go of
the invisible chains he had been holding.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The skills he had
cultivated and the feelings he had received from those who had supported him.
To answer them is not to use the violent power hidden within him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, he swiftly
picked up a stone that had fallen at his feet.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A crushed piece of
artificial tree. A sharp piece of stone, pointed like a needle. He poured his
Qi into it and compressed it.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What on earth is he
planning to do? While everyone in the martial arts garden, including Jihad,
wondered so, Nozomu turned around and threw the piece of stone filled with Qi.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The stone pierced
through the last barrier that had become unstable due to Jihad's blow, and
pierced the control panel that stood in front of Inda.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wha......!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the next instant,
the control panel began to explode in a series of small explosions, scattering
sparks. The magic power that controlled the arena's barriers and environmental
control lost its course and went on a rampage, destroying the formulas engraved
inside the control panel.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"To think he

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Inda let out an
inaudible scream, and Jihad also contorted his face.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The next moment, the
forest in the arena where Nozomu and Jihad were standing suddenly collapsed and
began raging like a stormy sea.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was as if an
earthquake and a storm had suddenly struck simultaneously before their eyes.
The ground repeatedly rose and fell, and the magic power leaking from the
arena's underground began to erupt like a geyser. The crumbling artificial
trees that turned into sand were mixed with the spewing magic power and became
a localized sandstorm that engulfed the arena.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While everyone was
shaken by the sudden turn of events, Nozomu kicked the ground.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Stop right
there, Nozomu Bountis!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Faced with Nozomu, who
was surging with fighting spirit as he shook aside Inda's attempts to stop him,
Jihad also readjusted his giant sword and intercepted him. The [Jaw Drop] was
swung out to blow away the approaching Nozomu from the flank.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"~!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, Jihad's giant
sword failed to reach Nozomu. Suddenly, the ground rose up in front of his
eyes, stopping him. Meanwhile, Nozomu, riding on the raised ground, attacked
Jihad from above. The blade being swung down was naturally infused with a
Qi-blade compressed to the utmost limit.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Kuh~!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad reflexively
repelled the blade coming at him from above his head with his mithril gauntlet.
The blade was so sharp that if he misjudged his timing even for a second, he
could have had his arm severed. The skill with which he was able to repel it,
even in the most unexpected circumstances, is remarkable. Then, Jihad swung the
giant sword, which had been dug into the raised ground, forcefully toward
Nozomu, who had landed on the ground. The raised ground was smashed, scattering
dirt and stones.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, the Jihad's
horizontal cleave did not catch Nozomu.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmm......!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This time, the ground
beneath Jihad's feet began to cave in. His feet were caught in the sinking
sand, and the horizontal cleave he swung was momentarily slowed down. In the
meantime, Nozomu leaped. He escaped from the [Jaw Drop]'s blade range and
disappeared into the sandstorm.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A few seconds later,
Jihad turned around as quickly as he could, raising his giant sword at the
Qi-blade that came at him from behind. By that time, Nozomu's blade was already
before him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A metallic clang
resounded. Nozomu's [Mumei] blade slashed and tore Jihad's cheek shallowly.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ugh!"</span></span></p>

escaped from Jihad's mouth. He counterattacked with his blade, only to have it

With Jihad, who had been caught flat-footed, in his vision, Nozomu pounced
three times from the opposite side with his [Flash Step</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">・</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Curved Movement].</span></span></p>

arena is in a state of disarray, repeatedly rising and sinking. In a place
where a normal person would not even be able to stand, Nozomu was running
around freely in all directions.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The story of Nozomu,

whether the ground is raging or a sandstorm covers his field of vision. He
looks like a water strider running on the surface of water, a mountain goat running

gravity. Regardless of his own will, his feet were caught in the raging ground,

applied to Arena. Jihad himself never thought that the aftermath of the attack
would be enough to finish off this skilled swordsman.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But even so, this

not a sword imbued with Qi, but a fist. The sword, which was supposed to have
been infused with Qi, was placed in the scabbard at his waist, and his fist
struck Jihad's giant sword in a swinging motion.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While Jihad was
surprised at the unexpected spectacle, Nozomu drew back his right hand, and
this time he swung his left fist forth. With the same momentum, he rotated his
body and released a spinning kick, then began to attack Jihad in a dance-like
motion, using every part of his body, including elbow strikes and palm strikes.</span></span></p>

circular movements, up, down, left, and right, linked together without pause.</span></span></p>

impressed with Nozomu's movement itself, declared that his judgment was poor.</span></span></p>

concluded that a mere Qi-blade would not work, so he resorted to a deceptive
strategy, but whatever the strategy was, the current Nozomu did not even have
the minimum strength to pull it off. A bad tactic would only endanger oneself.</span></span></p>

themselves are established as ritual magic, and while gathering the magic power
of the surroundings, they invoke an unlimited amount of reinforcement magic on
one's body. Fused with Nozomu's Qi-jutsu, the effect is further enhanced.</span></span></p>

throughout the arena swirled and converged on Nozomu. The sparkling, powdery
snow-like light of magic power was so magical that the scene was like diamond
dust.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu's blows, felt
through the giant sword, soon grew to the point that even Jihad could not
ignore them, and now, his punch sounds were so intense that they seemed to
resonate to the very core of his being.</span></span></p>

still not enough to break through Jihad's defenses. Not that there was anything
wrong with Nozomu's dance itself. The magic power that is now converging in his
body is comparable to the magic power of the best mages.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, the effect of
his Ability Suppression was still significant. The effect of the reinforcement
was so low compared to the magic power he clad himself in that he was unable to
break through Jihad's defenses which were like castle walls.</span></span></p>

dust obscured Jihad's vision. Immediately afterward, Nozomu took another step
forward with all of the magic power he had gained from the ritual body
technique infused in his left hand.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">By interrupting the
ritual body technique midway through, the magic-Qi left Nozomu's control and
lashed out at the user. Although his left arm's skin was ripped and its muscles
shredded, he ignored the pain and slammed his left hand against the [Jaw Drop]
held up by Jihad.</span></span></p>

the magic-Qi that he had been suppressing with his mental power was released.
The released power was like a muddy stream, swallowing Jihad's [Jaw Drop], and
finally caused the huge, rock-like sword to flung upward.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nnnn!?"</span></span></p>

breath, he put as much strength as he could into his leg, and at the same time

the compressed Qi through his elbows, hips, and torso, in coordination with the
interlocking muscles.</span></span></p>

of his arms could not escape from Nozomu's attack range. The moment he realized
it, he felt intense pain in his missing arm.</span></span></p>

out, closing in on him. But just before Jihad's blade seized Nozomu's back, a
myriad of magic circles suddenly appeared between Nozomu and Jihad. The
multi-layered magic circle formed a wall and intercepted Jihad's giant sword.
Jihad's face was dyed with surprise.</span></span></p>

that, the barrier surrounding the arena was lifted, and Irisdina and Inda
rushed toward the arena in a panic.</span></span></p>

hearing remained, finally, Nozomu was able to hear Inda's restraint. He exhaled
in relief and tried to raise his body. However, his whole body was unable to
muster the strength to do so, and he collapsed on the spot.</span></span></p>

Nozomu, and Indah's face tightened when she saw Jihad's severed left arm. In

Qi on his left arm. The blood that was flowing out vigorously was stopped. Then
an elderly man carrying a stone cane walked over to him. It was Fadrey.</span></span></p>

was taken away by Irisdina, Jihad also picked up his severed left arm and left
the martial arts garden with Fadrey. Then, the joint class was postponed due to
excessive damage from this mock combat. Inda, who was left behind, was forced
to deal with the aftermath with a pale face.</span></span></p>

Irisdina and called out to her in a cheerful tone. However, she was silent.
Eventually, her surprised face changed to a blank expression, and anger began

Irisdina grabbed a piece of cloth from a nearby table and threw it with all her

the wall. It made loud noises, and a pungent odor wafted through the air. In
the midst of all this, Irisdina's outbursts did not stop.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She kept throwing
whatever items nearby at Nozomu, who was in a state of panic.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">"</span><span lang="EN-US"> </span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Careful!

bandages, and other small items flew one after another. Unable to move from his
bed, Nozomu shrank back and called out to his friends behind Irisdina for help.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But they take one
glance at the flustered Nozomu and the angry Irisdina, and only let out a big
sigh.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, this is

looked dismayed and Feo teased, Nozomu's eyes caught Irisdina's figure, who was
about to throw a bucket of water this time.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-Wait......!"</span></span></p>

raise his voice, Irisdina threw the bucket at him. The bucket arced down on
Nozomu's head, splattering its contents.</span></span></p>

the treatment room was filled with a strange atmosphere. Nozomu sneezed, water
dripping from his body, and Irisdina turned away at the edge of the room, her
cheeks puffed out.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mars and the others
looked down at the drenched Nozomu with vague expressions on their faces.</span></span></p>

who was being treated with him, is no longer in this treatment room. He was
taken away with his left arm hanging by Inda, who came to confirm that his
wounds had been treated.</span></span></p>

of the medical examination. Bruises of various sizes and torn muscles. His
overall body functions, including internal organs, were severely weakened.
Frankly speaking, it was more difficult to find an unscathed part of him.</span></span></p>

already have an idea of the cause, the last sword drawing technique was
particularly bad. The consumption of Qi was extreme. It was an outrageous act
of drawing out more Qi from your already empty body. As a result, the harmony
of your whole body's movement was momentarily disrupted, and you damaged your
own body in the process."</span></span></p>

with the drawing technique, his muscles were strengthened to an extreme degree.
It is a technique that draws out the maximum power that the user can produce by
synchronizing them. This technique indeed enables the user to perform the [best
sword strike for the user], but if the user fails to control his or her Qi even
a little bit, it can lead to self-destruction.</span></span></p>

up his sleeves, pain shot through his entire body, and his arms were discolored
purple in several places due to internal bleeding.</span></span></p>

scenario, the muscles throughout his body could have been ruptured, and
everything from bones to internal organs could have been destroyed.</span></span></p>

curt, even though he clearly understood the danger.</span></span></p>

drooped and Mars and the others looked rather more subtle. As for Irisdina, the
corners of her eyes were lifted and her whole body began to radiate more anger.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Coupled with her fine
doll-like appearance, the intensity was so great that her best friend Tima, who
was nearby, involuntarily took a half-step away from her.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I've been
thinking about it for a while now, but Nozomu-sama is pretty much the same. In
essence, you are comparable to those muscle-brained fools, you know?"</span></span></p>

nodded in unison at Mena's words. Nozomu, being outnumbered, was scratching his
cheeks while letting his gaze drift in the air as if fleeing. Amidst all this,
Norn once again warned Nozomu.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"In any case, you

words, Irisdina closed in on Nozomu with an angry expression on her face.</span></span></p>

made Nozomu's eyes widen involuntarily.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Where did her usual
calmness go? She scolded him, leaning forward so much that her face was almost
touching his.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The other members of

emotions suddenly dropped at once. Her eyes began to moisten with tears, and
she began to clutch her eyes and whimper.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[A~a~. You made her

teasing voices rang out, and Nozomu panicked for a moment, but their light
words were soon replaced by a heavy silence.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Seeing Irisdina, who
usually maintained a dignified expression, reveal so much emotion, it was easy
to see how worried she was.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That's why Nozomu
could only bow his head.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Umm, sorry,

I won't forgive you."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Seeing Irisdina's face
contorted in pain, while acting sulkily like a child, Nozomu felt a pain as if
he had been shot through the chest.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You even pushed

lying on the ground came back to Irisdina's mind.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although nearly
manipulated by Tiamat, Nozomu was able to overcome the illusion, and was
severely wounded as he fought off one of the [Six Bad Omens].</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Weakened body and
consciousness that would not return. He was in danger of losing the light of
life at any moment.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And even though he
managed to wake up, his five senses, including sight and hearing, were affected
for some time afterward.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The fear of that
moment came back and tightened Irisdina's heart. Then she turned her face down,
holding her arms like a frightened child, her eyes wet with tears.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Maybe this is

Lisa and the others, but from this school as well."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu, feeling pain
in his heart over her appearance, felt he had to at least convey his feelings
to her, so he slowly opened his mouth while looking directly at Irisdina, whose
face was still downcast.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"At that time,
the students of this school were all watching. Now that I had decided to face
them one more time, I didn't want to run away from that."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was a place where
many people were watching. The previous Nozomu would have shut himself up in
his shell and done nothing because of the scornful stares and mindless words of
those around him. He would not have tried to do anything.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That was why I

to Anri, adding that he was surprised when she told him about this mock combat.
She was smiling and giving the V-sign.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Besides, there's
that false rumors that Ken has been spreading again. I can't just let it slide
like it did before. I also needed to act before those unfounded rumors took
hold again."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Rumors that grow over
the years tend to take on a life of their own.</span></span></p>

were never proven to be true, are somehow recognized as the truth and come to
be accepted as such. In fact, Nozomu's bad reputation in the past illustrates
this point.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is not easy to
dispel these rumors, which cannot be proven or disproven. But, on the other
hand, because there is no proof, many others just assume it, and the root of it
remains vague.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And the only two
elements that support Nozomu's bad reputation are [incompetent] and [a man who cheats
on his girlfriend]. This mock combat could be the catalyst to blow one of them
out of the water.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Therefore, I
used the techniques Shishō taught me without hesitation. Well, it was also
largely because I remembered the hand-to-hand combat I had with her. So,
um......"</span></span></p>

Nozomu's head, who was peering at Irisdina's expression.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As she wiped his head,
which was still dripping with water, she glanced at Irisdina.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There's no need
to sulk like that. Surely, it was necessary, considering what's to come."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I
know......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina slowly nodded
to Shina, who shrugged her shoulders.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Besides, it
wasn't a bad idea for him to let loose a little bit this time around. And it
reminded him of the time when he was with someone he cared about."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For Nozomu, who had
usually avoided using Qi-jutsu at school, this was the first time he could use
it to the fullest extent of his ability. Just like when he was training with
his master.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina also recalled
how fondly Nozomu spoke about his memories of his master. That is why it is
understandable why he went all out.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Still, she couldn't
shake off the choking feeling in her chest.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Umm, sorry for
making you worry again......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina began to feel
a bit guilty in front of Nozomu, who kept bowing his head apologetically. She
still had some anguish in her chest, but nevertheless, she was able to hear his
true intentions from his own mouth.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... No, I
should apologize as well. It's true, that Nozomu's reputation at the academy
had hardly changed at all. Considering that, your reasons are valid."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, that
doesn't mean Irisdina herself hasn't done anything so far.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Many people wondered
why she was with Nozomu, and some actually questioned her about it. Each time,
Irisdina denied Nozomu's bad reputation, but even so, she has not yet been able
to overturn people's perceptions of Nozomu that have been ingrained over the
past two years. Aware of her own helplessness, a shadow casts over Irisdina's
face now.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Iris, thank you.
For worrying about me......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, Nozomu's
voice gently dispelled that shadow.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina's face
rapidly heated up as Nozomu smiled in relief.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">*Thump*...... her body
trembled, and a tightening sensation in her chest assaulted her. It was
different from the anguish she had felt earlier when she was worried about
Nozomu's condition, and was accompanied by a sweet numbness that resembled
euphoria.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-It's fine!
Don't worry about it!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmm......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her gaze wandered, and
she unintentionally raised her voice. Shina, who was watching Irisdina like
that, frowned.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Not amusing. With
these emotions welling up inside her, Shina put strength into the hand that was
wiping Nozomu's head.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ouch, ouch!
Shina-san, it hurts!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Hmph!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ignoring Nozomu's
complaints, Shina finished wiping his head, then turned away with a pout and
walked away from the bed. Mimuru and Razward were grinning at her, but when
Shina glared at them, they hurriedly looked away and scuttled back.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Speaking of
which, you said you felt nostalgic, but were you and your master's bouts really
as extreme as that?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"We didn't do
anything that extreme, though. There were times when she would shoot [Phantom]
at me with precision enough that I could just barely avoid it. And when it came
to [Breaking Strike], she would go easy on me to ensure that I didn't
die."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As Mars inquired in
order to change the subject, Nozomu recounted his tearful memories with his
master. He smiled as he watched everyone's cheeks twitch.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Also, although
Jihad-sensei did use the [Jaw Drop], he was quite lenient with me up until the
middle of the match. He didn't even hit me directly with that stupidly huge
Qi-blade......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Is the problem
even on such a level!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, if you're
going to have a mock combat with someone of Shishō's class, you've got to be
prepared for that."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina and the
others were utterly flabbergasted by Nozomu's words. Once again, they realized
the reason why this mock combat was so abnormal.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Anyway, it's getting
late today. I think that's it for today, Irisdina and everyone should go home
now. I'll stay here tonight and keep an eye on him."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I understand.
Norn-sensei, I leave him to you. Well then, Nozomu-kun, you should behave
yourselves."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"At least stay
quiet until your injuries are healed. Don't make a fuss."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Come on, I'm not
a child......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Also,
Nozomu-kun, you will be hospitalized for a few days. You'll be kept under
observation for a few days. So, let's just go straight to the hospital
room."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu was
dissatisfied with Irisdina and Shina's words. Norn took his arm and stood him
up. The way she held his arm tightly looked more like a prisoner being taken
away than an injured person being assisted.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"U-Umm, I can
walk on my own......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After ignoring his
protests, Irisdina and the others took one last glance at Nozomu, who was being
taken away to the hospital room, and then headed back to their respective
homes.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Their faces were
radiant, the complete opposite of when they arrived here.</span></span></p>
