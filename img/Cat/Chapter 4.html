<h3>Chapter 4</h3>


<p>“…………”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>We were in one corner of the living room!</p>



<p>While Ayana and my mom were happily preparing shabu-shabu in the kitchen, I was sitting across from Seina-san.</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>Although there was no longer any tension between me and Seina-san, the sudden visit brought about by my mom… well, it was bound to be like this.</p>



<p>Glancing briefly at the kitchen, where Ayana and my mom were having a lively time, contrasting starkly with the quiet atmosphere between Seina-san and me, it was like night and day.</p>




<p>(But it was so sudden… well, it must be tough for Seina-san too. Her only support, her daughter, is over there.)</p>



<p>Well, I’ve got to do my best!</p>



<p>Steel myself like a samurai facing a battle, I opened my mouth.</p>



<p>“That… was unexpected, right?”</p>



<p>“…..It really is”</p>



<p>“Ah… yeah.”</p>



<p>“…..It really is”</p>



<p>“… yeah.”</p>



<p>I’m… too weak, it makes me want to cry.</p>




<p>When I asked if it was unexpected, the look in Seina-san’s eyes as she turned towards me seemed to say, “You should know by now,” and her voice carried a sense of exhaustion.</p>



<p>While her expression didn’t clearly indicate any distress, it was evident that being in this house was quite uncomfortable for Seina-san.</p>



<p>“Alright…”</p>



<p>If that’s the case, I’ve got to try even harder.</p>



<p>Since my mom is getting along well with Seina-san, and Seina-san had previously mentioned wanting to build a good relationship with my mom, this situation is an excellent opportunity.</p>



<p>“Seina-san, I’m glad we can meet again, even under these circumstances.”</p>



<p>“Towa-kun…”</p>



<p>“I’ve been thinking that we should create an opportunity like this eventually. I know you may not be fully prepared yet, but I believe my mom means well… as her son, let me say that.”</p>



<p>She means well… right? I trust you, Mom?</p>




<p>Well, I’m not really worried about this… but since I brought up the topic, Seina-san’s expression has improved.</p>



<p>“I understand. I thought I’d have to have this conversation eventually, and when I unexpectedly encountered the person I needed to talk to, my heart nearly leaped out of my chest… and when I was suddenly hugged, it reminded me of the past and frightened me, but I also felt that I needed to gather courage.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>I’m sorry, Seina-san.</p>



<p>If you just listen to what she’s saying, it’s entirely my mom’s fault… but despite her words, Seina-san continues with a smile.</p>



<p>“So don’t worry, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Ahaha, that’s a relief.”</p>



<p>Well, then, maybe I don’t need to worry too much… I hope?</p>



<p>Taking a break from talking, Seina-san looks around.</p>




<p>“Is there anything interesting here?”</p>



<p>“…I thought it was a very warm home.”</p>



<p>Ah… that’s incredibly heartwarming to hear.</p>



<p>Even though only my mom and I live in this house, I’ve never felt lonely… I’ve personally experienced the warmth of this home.</p>



<p>Ayana has said similar things before, but hearing it from her mother, Seina-san, made me incredibly happy.</p>



<p>“Ok~ay! Everything’s ready~!”</p>



<p>“Towa-kun and Mom, please join us too.”</p>



<p>Oh, it seems dinner is finally ready.</p>



<p>Hearing my mom’s voice, I noticed that Seina-san’s shoulders shook again, so I took her hand.</p>




<p>“Let’s go, Seina-san.”</p>



<p>“…You’re really kind, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Well, I can do this much.”</p>



<p>Feeling like a knight escorting a princess, I headed towards the table.</p>



<p>I sat next to my mom, and Seina-san sat next to Ayana… meaning, we were seated facing each other with our respective families.</p>



<p>“So, it’s shabu-shabu, huh. Feels like it’s been a while.”</p>



<p>Actually, it’s been a while since we’ve gathered like this with a decent number of people.</p>



<p>Apart from the meat, everything else was already in the pot, simmering and enticing our appetites with its bubbling sound.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, Towa-kun. The pot won’t run away even if you stare at it.”</p>




<p>“No, no, I’m not doing anything childish like that.”</p>



<p>“Eeh? Really? Is that true?”</p>



<p>“…Well, because it looks delicious, what can I do?”</p>



<p>She hit the nail on the head, but I quickly brushed it off.</p>



<p>Not only Ayana, but also my mom and Seina-san, smiled affectionately at me. I couldn’t help it, so I clasped my hands together.</p>



<p>“Let’s dig in.”</p>



<p>“Ara, resorting to force, I see.”</p>



<p>“Shut up.”</p>



<p>You’re the one who created this situation, don’t mock me.</p>




<p>Setting aside my mom, who had been having fun all along, I made my move first and took some meat and tofu, trying to balance it out.</p>



<p>“Alright, uhm…”</p>



<p>As for the shabu-shabu accompaniment, should I go for ponzu or sesame sauce? I’m definitely a sesame sauce person.</p>



<p>So when I reached out for the sesame sauce, it was unexpectedly handed to me by someone.</p>



<p>“Are you into sesame sauce, Towa-kun? Here you go.”</p>



<p>“Ah, thank you.”</p>



<p>It was Seina-san who handed it to me.</p>



<p>Since there were both ponzu and sesame sauce near Seina-san, it wasn’t strange for her to pass it to me… but, how did she know?</p>



<p>“Seems like Seina-san knew you wanted sesame sauce?”</p>




<p>“How did you know, Seina-san?”</p>



<p>“Well…. it was just a hunch.”</p>



<p>For just a hunch, she seemed to know from the beginning…?</p>



<p>Ayana, sitting in front of me, nodded as if she had some idea of what was going on, but when our eyes met, she just smiled.</p>



<p>“It’s strange. Hey, Towa-kun, I’m getting hungry, let’s eat.”</p>



<p>“Right… let’s!”</p>



<p>Well, there are some things I’m curious about, but for now, let’s just enjoy the delicious meal in front of us.</p>



<p>“…Mmm, it’s delicious.”</p>



<p>“It’s so tasty♪”</p>




<p>The flavor of the meat coated in sesame sauce is irresistible!</p>



<p>Of course, not just the meat, but all the other ingredients also complement each other perfectly, enhancing the deliciousness even more.</p>



<p>(…Mom and Seina-san aren’t eating, huh?)</p>



<p>While we kids were enjoying our shabu-shabu, the two adults hadn’t touched the pot yet and weren’t even talking.</p>



<p>Both my mom and Seina-san didn’t have gloomy expressions, but they seemed to be watching each other’s reactions.</p>



<p>(Ayana… she’s not worried at all.)</p>



<p>Returning my gaze to my mom and Seina-san, I noticed Ayana wasn’t showing any signs of being troubled.</p>



<p>She ate her shabu-shabu with relish while occasionally glancing at my mom and Seina-san, seeming curious about what they were talking about.</p>



<p>Probably… she’s not worried at all.</p>




<p>Not worrying isn’t in a bad sense, but rather, Ayana probably believes that my mom and Seina-san can handle it well.</p>



<p>“…. Fue, probing each other isn’t my style. We’re all gathered around the hot pot, so let’s not make it gloomy.”</p>



<p>It seemed like my mother couldn’t bear the silence anymore, so she spoke up. Her words acted as a catalyst to break the silence, and I followed suit.</p>



<p>“The root cause of this is partly due to your actions, Mom. Are you regretting it?”</p>



<p>“I’m not!”</p>



<p>“Don’t say that so confidently!”</p>



<p>I retorted sharply and lightly tapped my mother’s shoulder.</p>



<p>“Ouch?!”</p>



<p>It wasn’t painful enough for her to cry out loud, but at least my jab got her to start talking.</p>




<p>“I didn’t intend to stay silent forever. I was observing you. It’s been a long time since we’ve had a conversation like this.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it has. It feels like it’s been ages since then.”</p>



<p>“Indeed… a really long time has passed.”</p>



<p>Although I was curious about my mother and Seina-san’s conversation, Ayana and I decided to focus on enjoying our meal. In this atmosphere, it didn’t seem like there was any room for us to join their conversation.</p>



<p>“To be honest… just because Towa forgave you doesn’t mean I can forgive everything. But I suppose you’re the more wicked one.”</p>



<p>“No, I’m much the same. I can never say that I did nothing, or said nothing. Even if my mouth were torn apart, I couldn’t say such a thing.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s right. That’s why I headed to where you all were at that time… At that moment, I was so consumed by anger that I couldn’t see anything around me… I even felt like I wanted to kill you all.”</p>



<p>When my mother said she wanted to kill them, her eyes were deadly serious. While my mother genuinely cares for me, her words at that time scared me.</p>



<p>“…?”</p>




<p>At that moment, I noticed that Ayana was trembling. Though neither of us was directly being stared at by my mother, there was an indescribable sense of fear that made my spine tingle. Perhaps Ayana sensed it even more strongly than I did.</p>



<p>I gently stood up and approached Ayana.</p>



<p>“Ayana.”</p>



<p>“Towa-kun…”</p>



<p>I stroked her head reassuringly and embraced her shoulder.</p>



<p>“It’s okay, Mom isn’t angry.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>Yes, my mother’s words were strong, and her aura was intimidating… but she wasn’t angry. I couldn’t explain why, but I just felt that way instinctively. Maybe it’s because I’m her son.</p>



<p>“I told Towa I’m not dwelling on it anymore. But when I remember, it’s not that easy to let go… It’s really troublesome.”</p>




<p>“…”</p>



<p>“But yes… that’s right. Towa… my beloved son is moving forward with determination. So I should also face forward… It’s much better than being dragged down by the past forever.”</p>



<p>After saying that, my mother smiled. The earlier tense atmosphere and ominous words seemed to disappear, replaced by a calm demeanor. Seina-san’s expression softened for a moment but quickly hardened again.</p>



<p>“I…said horrible words just because I didn’t like him. I said words that even hurt my own daughter…I thought about it many times, but I was really stupid. Just like you have a son, I have a daughter…I know exactly how you feel.”</p>



<p>Seina-san might be considering things from the opposite perspective now. If it were Ayana who had the accident instead of me… She’s her precious daughter, so it would definitely be painful, even if the approach was wrong.</p>



<p>“I haven’t directly said it… I’m not trying to make excuses. I’m truly, truly sorry.”</p>



<p>Seina-san bowed her head as she said this.</p>



<p>To be honest, I don’t feel like she needs to bow her head anymore. I don’t want her to go that far. But right now, it’s a conversation between the parents. So, for now, all I can do is watch over my mother and Seina-san.</p>



<p>“Mom… You’ve really changed, haven’t you?”</p>




<p>As Ayana said this, it was clear that Seina-san’s transformation was significant.</p>



<p>Accepting Seina-san’s apology, Mom nodded once, wearing a smile that could charm even her son.</p>



<p>“I accept it. As Towa’s mother, I accept your apology.”</p>



<p>Upon hearing Mom’s words, Seina-san looked up. Tears flowed down her cheeks, threatening to ruin her carefully applied makeup, and she seemed to be biting her lip, trying to hold back her tears.</p>



<p>Perhaps… No, surely Seina-san had been worrying about this all along. By being forgiven as a mother herself, Seina-san was finally freed from the shackles of the past.</p>



<p>“Seina-san.”</p>



<p>I called out to her then.</p>



<p>“Mom and I have accepted your apology. So, this matter is settled now… We’ll have plenty of opportunities to interact in the future, so please, let’s get along.”</p>



<p>“Ah…”</p>




<p>Seina-san was completely undone at that point.</p>



<p>The amount of tears streaming down her cheeks only increased, and she seemed to be trying to hide her face with incredible force using the handkerchief I gave her.</p>



<p>“Mom, it’s okay. You did great.”</p>



<p>“Ah, Ayana…!”</p>



<p>As Ayana gently stroked her back, I couldn’t help but feel warmth. But at the same time, it seemed as if Ayana was consoling her older sister.</p>



<p>(That just goes to show how young Seina-san looks.)</p>



<p>It might be strange to think about such things in this situation, but the fact remains that both Mom and Seina-san… and even Hatsune-san, all looked much younger than their actual age.</p>



<p>While I was lost in these thoughts, Mom clapped her hands.</p>



<p>“Now then! Since we have such a wonderful hot pot in front of us, let’s not waste time sniffling and start eating!”</p>




<p>“Well, you’re the one who created this atmosphere in the first place!”</p>



<p>“Ouch!?”</p>



<p>I gave her shoulder a smack again, just for good measure.</p>



<p>Why do you have to hit me like that? I thought as I returned her gaze firmly.</p>



<p>“Muu… My son is being so cold today.”</p>



<p>Even though she was pouting like a petulant child, it suited her a little!</p>



<p>But, Mom’s words made sense. With such a delicious meal in front of us, it would be a shame to let it sit there untouched.</p>



<p>“Come on, Mom. It’s delicious, so let’s eat.”</p>



<p>“Well… Alright. I’m fine now.”</p>




<p>Encouraged by Ayana, Seina-san, who had finally calmed down, began to eat.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, I just realized something. The fact that beer was served in front of Mom and Seina-san means that Seina-san is staying over tonight, right? </p>



<p>Even if Mom drives her home, she can’t drive after drinking alcohol, but on the other hand, it’s not safe to let Seina-san walk home at this time of night, whether or not she’s consumed alcohol.</p>



<p>“Is Seina-san staying over tonight too?”</p>



<p>“Maybe… It seems likely. Will Ayana-san lend her some clothes?”</p>



<p>If she’s staying over, that would probably be the case… Well, I’ll leave that to Mom.</p>



<p>“Come on, have a drink too.”</p>



<p>“…I’m not really good with alcohol, though.”</p>


<p>“Oh, really? You don’t want to?”</p>




<p>“No, it’s not that I can’t drink.”</p>



<p>Even though she said it was okay, Seina-san reluctantly started drinking her beer.</p>



<p>“You’re still barbaric! Barbaric, but… but a really good kid!”</p>



<p>“Ahaha… Um, thank you?”</p>



<p>In the end, she ended up getting really drunk.</p>



<p>“I’ve never seen Mom like that before. She never drinks at home either.”</p>



<p>“…I feel like she’s a completely different person now.”</p>



<p>“To tell you the truth, I feel the same way. Mom is more of the type to serve drinks to others.”</p>



<p>Ah… I can imagine that.</p>




<p>If I were served drinks by such a beautiful woman, I’d probably end up drinking way too much.</p>



<p>“…But isn’t she a bit too weak?”</p>



<p>After scolding Mom with her face all red, she suddenly started praising her with a face that looked like she was about to cry. Her emotions were all over the place.</p>



<p>Is this the power of alcohol…? I should be careful with alcohol in the future too.</p>



<p>“It’s been a while since I had beer, and it’s delicious… huh?”</p>



<p>At that moment, Seina-san, who had regained her composure, looked towards us with a determined gaze… and then suddenly stood up.</p>



<p>“!?”</p>



<p>“Hii!?”</p>



<p>Humans tend to get startled by sudden movements.</p>




<p>Both Ayana and I were startled by Seina-san’s sudden actions, and I even ended up hitting my pinky toe on the table leg… Ouch, it hurts so much!</p>



<p>While I was writhing in pain, Ayana expressed concern for me, but just then, Seina-san suddenly hugged me.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, I’m a terrible person. To you… to you… Uwaaah!”</p>



<p>Even though she’s weak to alcohol, she’s crying so much!?</p>



<p>“Hey, Mom! Please don’t hug Towa-kun!”</p>



<p>Saying that, Ayana tried to pry Seina-san off, but her hug was so strong that it wasn’t easy to remove her.</p>



<p>But more importantly… there’s something I’m a bit concerned about as a man.</p>



<p>It’s the fact that I’m being pressed against her cheek by the hug, and her bre*sts, which are even larger than Ayana’s… They’re incredibly soft and feel good… I know Ayana would definitely get angry if I said something like this, but I’m just curious, not excited.</p>



<p>(Is that… the smell of alcohol…)</p>




<p>Because the moment I should be enjoying the softness of her large breasts, I’m overwhelmed by the smell of alcohol, which would normally be pleasant.</p>



<p>“Hey! You’re not taking my son!”</p>



<p>Mom joined the fray and hugged us from behind… What is this?</p>



<p>Being hugged by my own mother from the front and my mother-in-law from behind… What is this situation? Help me, Ayana.</p>



<p>And my wish was granted.</p>



<p>“Both of you, stop it! Towa-kun is going to smell like old age!!”</p>



<p>However… it was an incredibly powerful blow.</p>



<p>Upon hearing Ayana’s words about the smell of old age, both Mom and Seina-san froze… Literally, they didn’t move at all.</p>



<p>They stayed like that for a while, but then they slowly let go of me and murmured in defeat.</p>




<p>“…Right. We’re already getting up there in age, huh? Haha.”</p>



<p>“Old age smell… You’re right. I’m like an old hag trying to cover it up with perfume. Haha.”</p>



<p>Watching the two of them laugh like broken machines, Ayana snorted disdainfully… Is this hell?</p>



<p>“Ayana, I think you went a bit too far with that just now…”</p>



<p>“To get Towa-kun back, a little sacrifices must be made.”</p>



<p>“But that’s not just a ‘little’!”</p>



<p>Both of them look like their souls are leaving their bodies!</p>



<p>While there are plenty of hurtful words for women, I guess ‘old age smell’ is a bit too much… Well, not just for women, but for fathers too, it’s probably the last thing they want to hear from their daughters, right?</p>



<p>(Being told ‘You smell like dad!’ and despairing, there’s definitely a dad like that somewhere…)</p>




<p>Anyway, leaving aside the dad situation, Ayana’s words seemed to pierce through the two mothers like sharper than any blade.</p>



<p>Mom and Seina-san, who were hugging me, separated with a dejected air, and instead, Ayana hugged me tightly.</p>



<p>“Punishment complete.”</p>



<p>I thought to myself… Isn’t Ayana the real demon here?</p>



<p>“Now, Towa-kun. Let’s finish the rest of the food.”</p>



<p>“…Yeah.”</p>



<p>Maybe it’s best not to dwell on it too much.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>After a little while, Mom and Seina-san revived, and the lively shabu-shabu party resumed. Needless to say, both Mom and Seina-san, despite dabbling in the shabu-shabu, didn’t stop their alcohol intake… the rest is self-explanatory.</p>



<p>“…Munyaa”</p>



<p>“Suu… Suu…”</p>



<p>Both mothers lay on the table as if collapsing. They had eaten quite a bit and drank just as much alcohol, so it was only natural for them to end up like this. Especially considering that despite already drinking quite a bit when she clung to me earlier, Seina-san’s continued intake of alcohol was incredible.</p>



<p>“I guess Mom will have a hangover tomorrow.”</p>



<p>“Maybe… And they made quite a mess.”</p>



<p>Well, hosting a shabu-shabu party would naturally lead to this kind of situation.</p>



<p>“Mom and Seina-san… they’re beyond saving now, so let’s clean up ourselves.”</p>




<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>So, we started cleaning up, trying not to wake up Mom and Seina-san.</p>



<p>“…It was fun.”</p>



<p>Yeah… Tonight’s dinner was more enjoyable than usual. Usually, it’s just Mom and me having dinner together, occasionally joined by Ayana. So, having just the four of us isn’t that unusual, but it’s been a while since it was as lively as today.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“You look a bit lonely, you know?”</p>



<p>…Yare yare (Good grief), Ayana really knows me well.</p>



<p>“I guess I am… It wasn’t often that it got that noisy.”</p>




<p>“Me too. Even when it’s just you, me, and Akemi-san, it’s not as loud.”</p>



<p>While the three of us can get loud too, it’s not as much as today.</p>



<p>“But, watching the two of them drunk was fun.”</p>



<p>“Fufu, me too. And seeing Mom get drunk like that, I feel a bit relieved.”</p>



<p>“…And you, Ayana.”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>“Was today… a good day for you?”</p>



<p>The answer to that question was obvious.</p>



<p>Even so, I wanted to hear it from Ayana herself. So, I asked her, and she looked at me, smiled, and nodded.</p>




<p>“It was more than just great… It was a day that made me realize I’ve been wishing for this moment for a long time.”</p>



<p>“I see… Haha, that’s good to hear.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>Ayana stopped speaking and paused from washing the dishes.</p>



<p>“Ayana?”</p>



<p>She dried her hands with a towel and then suddenly came around behind me, wrapping her arms around me.</p>



<p>It made washing the dishes a bit awkward, but I didn’t mind. If she wanted to hold me like this, I’d let her.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>




<p>“…Thank you.”</p>



<p>“Ou.”</p>



<p>I wonder what she’s thanking me for… I have too many guesses, but I guess I don’t need to ask. It’s just something that I know.”</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, I love you.”</p>



<p>“I love you too.”</p>



<p>“I love you so, so much.”</p>



<p>“Ah… I guess I feel the same.”</p>



<p>“Say it properly with words.”</p>



<p>“You’re such a spoiled princess.”</p>




<p>“But you think I’m cute, right, Towa-kun?”</p>



<p>“I mean, yeah.”</p>



<p>I firmly affirmed that. In response, her arms tightened around me even more, putting a bit more pressure on my stomach, but not enough to be uncomfortable.</p>



<p>“For me, for you, for Mom and Seina-san… If today was a good day for all of us, then I’m happy.”</p>



<p>As I was about to resume washing the dishes, I caught Mom observing us. Our eyes met, and she quickly averted her gaze.</p>



<p>“What are you doing, Mom?”</p>



<p>“Eh!?”</p>



<p>“Ahaha, busted, huh…”</p>



<p>Mom laughed awkwardly.</p>




<p>“How long have you been awake?”</p>



<p>“I swear! It was just a moment ago!”</p>



<p>“Akemi-san…”</p>



<p>“Ayana-chan, don’t give me that look! I wasn’t eavesdropping on purpose!”</p>



<p>No no, that’s not very convincing, is it?</p>



<p>But, given the circumstances, it’s not surprising she was watching, and I can’t blame her since I thought she was still asleep.</p>



<p>“Mou, what is going on~…”</p>



<p>Due to the slight commotion, Seina-san also woke up. However, she seemed a bit dazed and, after briefly staring at us, promptly fell back asleep.</p>



<p>“Anyway…we are going to cleaning up.”</p>




<p>“Yeah, Mom, please just stay put.”</p>



<p>“Y~es!”</p>



<p>“Acting like a child…”</p>



<p>As I teased Mom, we resumed cleaning up, and with Ayana’s help, we finished quickly.</p>



<p>“Impressive as always, Ayana. You’re fast and accurate.”</p>



<p>“Fufu… This is all part of my bride training. I’ve been doing it happily, reminding myself that I need to be a bride worthy of you, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>Please don’t suddenly say embarrassing things like that… Especially not with Mom watching and smiling… Yes, yes, we get it, just enjoy watching us!</p>



<p>“Towa’s charm strikes again♪”</p>



<p>“Oh?”</p>




<p>“…Sorry.”</p>



<p>“Oh! Akemi-san succumbs to Towa-kun’s greatness!”</p>



<p>“Ayana seems to be having so much fun!”</p>



<p>Their smiles never fade… They never fade, but it’s so exhausting!!</p>



<p>Despite being stared at by Mom with a smile the whole time, Ayana and I completed the chores. Then, I lifted up the sleeping Seina-san.</p>



<p>“Heave-ho.”</p>



<p>It’s what you’d call the princess carry.</p>



<p>Whether this was the best option or not, I figured it would be easier for me to carry her than for the ladies… However, I can’t help but wonder why Ayana and Mom look so envious as they watch me carrying Seina-san.</p>



<p>“I’m jealous…”</p>




<p>“Towa’s princess carry… I’m envious.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>Seina-san will be sleeping in Mom’s room.</p>



<p>Due to the sudden turn of events, we haven’t had a chance to clean the other rooms, and we can’t exactly have guests, especially Seina-san’s mother, sleeping on the living room sofa. Let me handle this.</p>



<p>Upon entering the room, Mom was already preparing the futon. Since the sheets were freshly washed, Seina-san should have no problem sleeping.</p>



<p>“Fue~… I’m going to bed too… zzz…”</p>



<p>“….Eh? You’re already asleep?”</p>



<p>“Zzz… zzz…”</p>



<p>Just as I thought Mom had laid Seina-san down to sleep, Mom herself, with lightning speed, had fallen asleep.</p>




<p>“Isn’t that a bit too fast…”</p>



<p>“Truly a divine skill…”</p>



<p>Using the term ‘divine skill’ for something like this isn’t quite appropriate, Ayana.</p>



<p>Without even taking a bath, both Mom and Seina-san had fallen asleep. Well, considering they didn’t change clothes, there’s nothing to be done about it, but… It’s quite a lesson to see the fate of those swallowed up by alcohol.</p>



<p>“Hey, Ayana.”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>“When we grow up and start drinking, let’s be careful, okay?”</p>



<p>“Fufu… Sure thing♪”</p>



<p>We still have a few more years until we reach the legal drinking age of twenty. But just imagining the day when I can drink with this precious and beloved girl… Haha.</p>




<p>“What’s up?”</p>



<p>“I was just imagining drinking with you, Ayana. I wonder if we’ll still be as lovey-dovey even when we’re that age.”</p>



<p>“Of course we will!”</p>



<p>In Ayana’s mind, our relationship is a given.</p>



<p>“There’s nothing else to do now, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. All that’s left is to take a bath and go to bed.”</p>



<p>“In that case, let’s bathe together? Let’s wash each other♪”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>Even suggesting bathing together, she’s truly something. My girlfriend and future wife, isn’t she adorable!</p>




<p>“Towa-kun, you’re grinning.”</p>



<p>“I was thinking about you.”</p>



<p>“Then think about me even more♪”</p>



<p>Yes, with that smile directed at me, once again, I couldn’t help but think she’s cute.</p>



<p>Afterward, we bathed together, and even though it’s a place for washing, it’s inevitable that we’ll end up sweating a little.</p>



<p>“Aah… Feels refreshing.”</p>



<p>“It was nice in more ways than one♪”</p>



<p>Ah… Yeah, you’re right.</p>



<p>We’re still far from feeling like our night is over. In fact, Ayana and I are both completely satisfied with today.</p>




<p>“Fuwaa…”</p>



<p>“Feeling sleepy?”</p>



<p>Ayana nodded and slowly lay down on the bed. Even though she was looking at me, her eyelids seemed to be closing, and she looked very sleepy.</p>



<p>“Want to sleep?”</p>



<p>“No, I don’t want to sleep without Towa-kun’s warmth.”</p>



<p>Her words and the way she said them are incredibly cute, but she’s already closing her eyes.</p>



<p>“Zzz… Zzz…”</p>



<p>“You’re falling asleep already?”</p>



<p>It’s as fast as Mom a moment ago!</p>




<p>I watched Ayana’s sleeping face for a while, but gradually, I started feeling sleepy too, so I guess I’ll go to sleep.</p>



<p>As I slipped into bed to avoid waking Ayana, she clung to me as if I were the perfect pillow. </p>



<p>“Ehehe.” </p>



<p>Ayana giggled mischievously as she pressed her face against my neck, gently licking it with her tongue.</p>



<p>With her legs intertwined with mine, she effectively blocked any escape route, showing her intent to continue licking me as she pleased.</p>



<p>“Ayana?”</p>



<p>“……”</p>



<p>“You’re awake, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>“Ara, caught me, huh?”</p>




<p>But her acting skills were impressive, considering I thought she was completely asleep. Opening her eyes, she smiled sweetly… but then quickly closed them again, looking sleepy.</p>



<p>“Well… I’ve reached my limit. I’m really, really sleepy.”</p>



<p>“Oh, seriously?”</p>



<p>“Yes… I tried to stay awake just to tease you, but I can’t do it anymore.”</p>



<p>With that, about thirty seconds later, Ayana began to breathe deeply, indicating that she had finally fallen asleep for real.</p>



<p>“So many things happened today… Goodnight, Ayana.”</p>



<p>Of course, there was no response. As I lay there, embraced by Ayana’s peaceful sleeping breaths, I closed my eyes, cherishing her presence and feeling the joy she brought me throughout the day.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“….Fue, this tea tastes delicious.”</p>



<p>It wasn’t morning when I woke up, just a regular late-night awakening. Since I felt a bit thirsty, I decided to escape from Ayana’s embrace and ended up here in the living room, drinking tea.</p>




<p>“It wasn’t a dream after all… haha.”</p>



<p>Recalling today’s events, even though it’s technically yesterday now, brings a smile to my face.</p>



<p>Just as I was quietly reflecting on things, I heard some noise coming from the hallway, causing me to tense up.</p>



<p>“….What’s going on?”</p>



<p>I chuckled at the thought that the noise could only have been Ayana, Mom, or Seina-san since no one else was around. </p>



<p>I considered the possibility that Ayana had come downstairs from the second floor after realizing I wasn’t there, but it seemed that wasn’t the case.</p>



<p>“Seina-san, is that you?”</p>



<p>“Oh, Towa-kun…?”</p>



<p>As she peeked her head out from the hallway, there stood Seina-san.</p>




<p>Was she coming back from the bathroom? Well, it’s not something you ask a lady, but encountering each other like this late at night does feel a bit awkward. How should I continue this conversation?</p>



<p>It almost feels like a rehearsed encounter, like when I visited Ayana’s house… But this time, Seina-san initiated the conversation.</p>



<p>“So, you’re awake too, Towa-kun?”</p>



<p>“Yeah… I got a bit thirsty.”</p>



<p>“I see. I woke up because I needed to use the restroom.”</p>



<p>“Heh, I see.”</p>



<p>“When I woke up, I was momentarily confused about where I was. But then I saw Akemi’s face… and I remembered.”</p>



<p>Ah, she means Mom…</p>



<p>Come to think of it, both Mom and Seina-san started calling each other by their names at some point… Hearing it again, it makes me really happy that they’ve become close.</p>




<p>“I’m really happy that Mom and Seina-san have become friends.”</p>



<p>“I’m surprised at how easily I’ve come to accept Akemi. Though, I feel like she’s accepted me just as much.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that because of Seina-san’s personality?”</p>



<p>“Please stop. Even you know how awful my personality can be, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Please refrain from making self-deprecating jokes…”</p>



<p>“Sorry. Talking to you just makes me happy.”</p>



<p>As uncomfortable as it is to hear her self-deprecation, I can’t help but be amused by it.</p>



<p>“Are you not thirsty, Seina-san? How about some tea together?”</p>



<p>“Is it alright? In that case, I’ll have a cup.”</p>




<p>“Yes, I am back!” </p>



<p>“Fufu, what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>



<p>I poured barley tea into a cup and handed it to Seina-san who was giggling.</p>



<p>“Thank you.”</p>



<p>“No problem.”</p>



<p>Taking the cup, Seina-san proceeded to drink it all in one go.</p>



<p>“That’s a nice drink.”</p>



<p>I feel like I could gaze at it for a while, especially with the stars around.</p>



<p>“Beautiful… isn’t it?”</p>




<p>Is there some hidden meaning in those words…?</p>



<p>When our eyes met as I glanced at her, Seina-san smiled innocently, seeming pleased that her mischief had succeeded. But her smile was so much like Ayana’s.</p>



<p>(…She really does have a beautiful smile. At this point, that once intimidating expression seems almost rare.)</p>



<p>Or perhaps it was when she was almost scolded in the city? She seems like a completely different person then… But when I interact with her like this, I realize – this is the real Seina-san.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun?”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>“Thank you for today. I’ll tell Ayana again tomorrow, but it’s been a long time since I’ve had such a happy and enjoyable day.”</p>



<p>“Haha, if you say that, it makes me happy too.”</p>



<p>More than anything, receiving such words from her is happiness for me.</p>




<p>I’ve said this time and time again, but it was a chance encounter brought about by my mother…well, in a sense, you could say it was inevitable, but I can only thank my mother for this.</p>



<p>“I’d like… to spend time like this again.” </p>



<p>“We can do this anytime. Please come over whenever you want.”</p>



<p>Hearing this, Seina-san blinked her eyes, placed a hand on her eye area, and turned her face away.</p>



<p>I waited for her to calm down without saying anything and, finally, when she raised her face again, I continued.</p>



<p>“If I hadn’t done anything, I wouldn’t have had the chance to talk to Seina-san like this, and our relationship would have stayed bad. That’s why I’m really happy that we could understand each other like this… I’m internally patting myself on the back, thinking, ‘Good job, me.'”</p>



<p>“Did you really want to get along with me that much?”</p>



<p>“Of course!”</p>



<p>“You’re… you’re so insistent…”</p>




<p>I want her to understand just how determined I was… Well, if it meant we wouldn’t get involved with each other, that would have been fine too, I guess. But I was also a bit scared about that.</p>



<p>“Can I hold onto your arm for a bit?”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“Is that a no?”</p>



<p>“Um… it’s fine, I guess.”</p>



<p>With a puzzled expression, she nodded, and at that moment, Seina-san hugged my arm.</p>



<p>It felt like she was hugging me tightly to her chest, and an incredibly happy sensation gently enveloped me.</p>



<p>Seina-san nodded with a curious expression and said,</p>



<p>“You seem like a reliable young man. I can understand why Ayana would be so captivated by you.”</p>




<p>“Can I be confident about that?”</p>



<p>“Being by Ayana’s side, you’re like a pillar of confidence. I hope you continue to progress towards marriage.”</p>



<p>“Marriage…”</p>



<p>While I thought it might be too early for that, imagining such a future is just what guys do sometimes. I also occasionally wonder what Ayana would look like in a wedding dress.</p>



<p>“In that case, Towa-kun will become my son.”</p>



<p>“Ayana would be my mother’s daughter.”</p>



<p>“It’s a win-win situation!”</p>



<p>“You seem really happy.”</p>



<p>“I am, I’m ecstatic! Aah, I can’t wait for that day to come!”</p>




<p>Although it’s still a few years away, I mentioned that I’d like it to happen someday. As we continued to gaze at the stars for what seemed like an eternity, I reflected on how precious and happy this moment was.</p>



<p>(Life can take different directions with just one action… that’s what life is about. But it’s also possible to push forward towards the best future you desire. It’s not always about hardship and difficulty… you can also seize a happy future for yourself.)</p>



<p>Thinking about the future, I feel like there’s still so much ahead… I can say with confidence that there definitely is.</p>



<p>While I don’t like to be too confident about such things, I can confidently say that I’m ready for whatever comes my way.</p>



<p>“Ye~s… so I actually became friends with Akemi. That girl who used to be called ‘Yasha of Third Street’ or ‘Princess of Yasha’ back then.” [TL: Yasha = Buddhist guardian deities sometimes depicted as demonic warriors]</p>



<p>“…What kind of menacing nickname is that?”</p>



<p>“That’s what they called her in high school. Quite the nickname, don’t you think?”</p>



<p>“My mother… she was called ‘Yasha’? or ‘Princess of Yasha’?”</p>



<p>“Ara, you hadn’t heard?”</p>




<p>“I hadn’t… Ayana probably doesn’t know about that nickname either.”</p>



<p>“Maybe it was better not to mention it…”</p>



<p>Yeah, maybe.</p>



<p>Did I really want to know…?</p>



<p>“It sounds interesting, so why not ask her? About being called ‘Yasha of Third Street.'”</p>



<p>“I hope she won’t cry.”</p>



<p>“She might cry from embarrassment.”</p>



<p>I thought about not doing that, but now I had a topic to make fun of her, and it would be fun to ask her about it by surprise.</p>



<p>“…..Suu!”</p>




<p>“What?”</p>



<p>I quickly turned my gaze behind me.</p>



<p>At times like this, I feel like Ayana is standing right behind me, so I turned around, but she wasn’t there, which was a relief.</p>



<p>When I told Seina-san about this, she burst into laughter, holding her stomach as if she found it incredibly amusing.</p>



<p>“Hahaha! I can’t believe that… but it’s so funny because it could totally be true!”</p>



<p>“Yeah, right? …Suu!”</p>



<p>“Suu!”</p>



<p>I even had the feeling that someone might overhear us when we were talking about it!?</p>



<p>Thinking that, I turned my gaze again, but this time Seina-san did the same, seeming to find it amusing.</p>




<p>“Ayana isn’t here, right?”</p>



<p>“No, she’s not.”</p>



<p>With that, we laughed together, and it was time to go to bed.</p>



<p>“Well then, Towa-kun, see you tomorrow.”</p>



<p>“Yes, see you tomorrow.”</p>



<p>As we parted ways, Seina-san stopped and asked me something.</p>



<p>“Hey, Towa-kun… do I really smell that bad of aging?”</p>



<p>“…………….”</p>



<p>Ayana, I’m really concerned about what you have done.</p>
