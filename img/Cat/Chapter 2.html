<h2>Chapter 2</h2>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>[Ayana PoV]</strong></p>



<p>“….Fufu, it truly was a happy everyday life, huh.”</p>



<p>Even though it was just for a few days, the days I spent at Towa-kun’s house were absolutely amazing… With Towa-kun by my side, and of course, Akemi-san too… It was really enjoyable.</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>Time and time again, I thought about turning back.</p>



<p>I felt joy being officially together with Towa-kun, and being able to be by his side.</p>



<p>…Haa, am I becoming too dependent on Towa-kun compared to before?</p>



<p>“…Phew, for now, I need to focus on what’s in front of me.”</p>




<p>Being able to think only about Towa-kun is both my weakness and my strength… My friends might think I’m overthinking it, but isn’t it wonderful to be able to feel so strongly about someone you love?</p>



<p>“Ah, I can’t concentrate at all after saying that!”</p>



<p>It’s such a dire situation when I can’t get Towa-kun out of my head even when he’s not around!</p>



<p>I don’t particularly dislike or fear it, but I feel like if I continue like this, it’ll become a serious problem… Alright! I need to pull myself together!</p>



<p>I lightly slap my cheeks and take a deep breath before entering the house.</p>



<p>“I’m back.”</p>



<p>I call out as I open the door — no response.</p>



<p>Without particularly worrying about it, I head straight for the living room… There, I see my mother sitting in a chair, staring blankly ahead.</p>



<p>Feeling like it’s been a while since I’ve seen my mother like this is probably because the days at Towa-kun’s house were so intense.</p>




<p>“It’s still bright outside, but wouldn’t it be better to turn on a light or something?”</p>



<p>I say as I turn on the light and sit down in front of my mother, who still doesn’t react.</p>



<p>The table between my mother and me only has one glass placed on it… Could it be that it’s been like this the whole time I wasn’t here for the past few days?</p>



<p>“Mom, don’t tell me you have not eaten for the past few days, have you?”</p>



<p>“…Of course not.”</p>



<p>“Well, that’s good to hear.”</p>



<p>I knew it, but still.</p>



<p>My mother is an important family member to me… That’s for sure, but the events from my childhood are too significant, and they’ve left me with dark feelings towards my mother.</p>



<p>“…You look really worn out.”</p>




<p>“…………”</p>



<p>It’s a face I wouldn’t expect from my mother, who usually takes care of her appearance.</p>



<p>Like Akemi-san, Towa-kun’s mother, my mother also looks younger than her actual age… She’s truly a beautiful person, but with her current dark expression, she looks older… <em>cough</em>.</p>



<p>It would be rude to say she looks older, so I’ll refrain from saying that.</p>



<p>(Is my mind this calm because it’s filled with something? Even able to make jokes like this…)</p>



<p>Suppressing a smile, I look at my mother again.</p>



<p>My mother, who had been silent all this time, suddenly exhales and meets my gaze before speaking.</p>



<p>“It’s only natural for me to end up like this when my own daughter tells me she hates me and hates that we share the same blood.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>




<p>“You don’t need to apologize. Your words were like a divine revelation to me… I thought it was only natural to feel that way even if you said that.”</p>



<p>Is this person really my mother?</p>



<p>The question arises in my mind, and I’ve never seen my mother like this before… But even so, her words directed at Towa-kun and the others won’t just disappear.</p>



<p>“Even so, the words you said won’t go away, Mom.”</p>



<p>“I understand… I understand.”</p>



<p>My mother tightens her grip on the glass.</p>



<p>It’s unbearable to see my mother mentally drained… But, surprisingly, I had a feeling — if my mother was truly as I knew her, she would blame herself for her faults, and perhaps even blame Towa-kun and Akemi-san for my actions.</p>



<p>“How have you been spending these past few days?”</p>



<p>To that question, I answered without any hesitation.</p>




<p>“I was happy — I’ve liked Towa-kun for a long time… And finally, we exchanged our true feelings. I didn’t feel like I was holding back before, but with our relationship progressing, I feel even more liberated. I truly, truly had a few days of happiness.”</p>



<p>I wonder what expression I’m wearing right now.</p>



<p>I can’t confirm it myself, but I’m probably wearing a smile of happiness, one that my mother has never seen before.</p>



<p>“Mom, I was about to do something terrible.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>My mother’s eyes widen at my sudden words.</p>



<p>I was about to do something terrible… I don’t need to tell my mother about the details, and it’s enough that only Towa-kun knows about it.</p>



<p>I smile lightly and continue speaking while looking directly into my mother’s eyes.</p>



<p>“That day, the day Towa-kun had an accident, it all started there. The initial ones who said terrible things to Towa-kun were Hatsune-san and Kotone-chan… and mom was also there — I couldn’t forgive those who hurt Towa-kun… I had such hatred from that time.”</p>




<p>“Ayana…”</p>



<p>“You didn’t notice, did you? I was very good at putting on a mask.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>My mother’s mouth twitches, showing signs of disturbance.</p>



<p>Perhaps the image my mother had of me is crumbling with a loud noise, but there’s no choice but for her to believe that this is the real me.</p>



<p>“But… Towa-kun helped me.”</p>



<p>“That child…”</p>



<p>“Yes. Not only did he see through the true feelings hidden beneath the mask, but he also accepted even someone like me, and said he wanted to move forward together and be happy.”</p>



<p>The rest is just as my mother knows.</p>




<p>Until now, whenever Towa-kun’s topic came up, my mother would make a displeased face, so I had considered the possibility of the conversation being interrupted. However, despite her dark expression, she listened to the end… This is truly the first time I’ve seen my mother like this.</p>



<p>“Mom. I love Towa-kun… I truly do.”</p>



<p>“I understand… I knew from every word you said how you felt about him.”</p>



<p>I nodded in agreement, relieved.</p>



<p>“I came back today because I felt it wouldn’t be right to keep relying on Towa-kun and Akemi-san, and also because I thought it was about time I talked to Mom. Honestly, I feel like I talked about a lot more than I had imagined.”</p>



<p>“I see. From my perspective, the amount of information was overwhelming, but I might have been happy to hear it from you.” </p>



<p>“I even considered the possibility of you getting upset and telling me to stop in the middle of the conversation.”</p>



<p>“That’s….”</p>



<p>My mother avoided my gaze, perhaps imagining it herself.</p>




<p>It’s the first time I’ve seen her look guilty like this… Hmm~, today is a day to see various expressions of my mother.</p>



<p>“We talked about a lot of things, but I’m dating Towa-kun. I declare that I’ll be happier than anyone else — Mom, are you opposed to it?”</p>



<p>In response to my question, my mother shook her head — which means she has no objections.</p>



<p>“Thank you.”</p>



<p>“You don’t need to thank me… You’ve just been united with the person you love.”</p>



<p>But just saying that, Mom… Considering everything that’s happened before, I didn’t think she’d accept it so readily, come on!</p>



<p>…Why am I so exhausted when I’m having such an important conversation?</p>



<p>To be honest, I was planning to cause such a ruckus that she’d get upset!</p>



<p>“Well, it’s a relief that it didn’t go that far.”</p>




<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“It’s nothing.”</p>



<p>It really is nothing, so please don’t worry about it.</p>



<p>Taking a deep breath to calm my feelings for a moment… Now, I think I’ve conveyed what I wanted to say.</p>



<p>Now, let’s see… Let’s try asking.</p>



<p>“Mom, can I ask you something?”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“Why… why did you dislike Towa-kun and Akemi-san?”</p>



<p>That’s what I wanted to know.</p>




<p>There have been countless opportunities to ask before, but I knew my mother would never tell me… But now it’s different — I feel like my mother will tell me now.</p>



<p>“…Right.”</p>



<p>My mother nodded and continued speaking.</p>



<p>“Ridiculed by others for something trivial… It wouldn’t be strange if they laughed at me for that.”</p>



<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>



<p>“I was a childhood friend of…… Towa Yukishiro’s father.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>Childhood friends…?</p>



<p>My mother and Towa-kun’s father were childhood friends…?</p>




<p>“Um… you’re not joking, are you?”</p>



<p>“I’m not joking. Wait a moment.”</p>



<p>Saying that, my mother got up and brought an album from her room.</p>



<p>“This.”</p>



<p>Several photos were pasted on the opened pages.</p>



<p>In all of them, a young mother is photographed… Next to her stands a man who looks very kind and has a strikingly handsome face, much like Towa-kun’s.</p>



<p>My mother, blushing with a smile… If it wasn’t just my imagination, I could tell she definitely had feelings for this man.</p>



<p>“Ryo… Yukishiro-san.”</p>



<p>“Ara, you know his name?”</p>




<p>“…I heard it from Akemi-san.”</p>



<p>I had heard about Towa-kun’s father from Akemi-san before. When I visited their house, she showed me some photos… The ones from that time were younger, but the resemblance was clear.</p>



<p>But now it’s confirmed… So that’s how it was. My mother and Towa-kun’s father were childhood friends.</p>



<p>“Ryo-san… I met Ryo-kun when we were in elementary school, and he was very concerned about me, a shy girl. He took me to various places holding hands.”</p>



<p>“Shy…? Mom?”</p>



<p>“…That’s back then.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t imagine my mother being shy at all… Eh? There are many parts that concern me or seem strange, but listening to my mother’s past stories like this is completely new to me… I wonder what kind of day today is.</p>



<p>“Ryo-kun and I grew up as good friends. By the time we were in high school and starting to seriously notice the opposite sex, I also had strong feelings for him. But… he met that girl who was famous as a delinquent.”</p>



<p>“…That’s Akemi-san.”</p>




<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>



<p>For a moment, my mother’s expression twisted with resentment, but she shook her head and switched to a calm expression, lost in memories of the past again.</p>



<p>“I don’t know why they became so close so quickly, but Ryo-kun soon became her boyfriend… I couldn’t understand why.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>“To put it bluntly, I just felt like I was too late. The person I had liked for so long was taken away by that nobody delinquent girl. I resented her so much for that.”</p>



<p>I sensed my mother’s bitterness in her words, and at the same time, I understood that this might have been what was hidden.</p>



<p>“So is that why you disliked Towa-kun and Akemi-san? Because Akemi-san ended up with your beloved person… and Towa-kun, their child?”</p>



<p>“That’s right.”</p>



<p>“…Isn’t that just plain resentment?”</p>




<p>When I pointed out that it sounded like resentment, my mother nodded weakly.</p>



<p>I can’t say I don’t understand my mother’s feelings… Childhood friends are not just an unrelated term for me either.</p>



<p>If Towa-kun, whom I’ve liked for so long, were to go to someone else… Even though it’s no longer a possibility, just imagining it feels like my heart is about to burst.</p>



<p>“As Ayana said, it’s just plain resentment. When he had the accident, maybe I didn’t say it directly because I felt some guilt in my conscience.”</p>



<p>“Even if you make excuses with those words…!”</p>



<p>“I know… I was a terrible person through and through.”</p>



<p>My mother’s expression looked pained, and her eyes were filled with regret.</p>



<p>I want to say to her, “If you were going to make that face, you shouldn’t have done it in the first place!”… but even I, who wanted my mother to be hurt, couldn’t bring myself to deliver any more blows.</p>



<p>“Do… does Akemi-san know about this?”</p>




<p>“If Ryo-kun talked about it, she might know… But Ayana hasn’t heard anything, right?”</p>



<p>“…That’s right. I haven’t heard anything.”</p>



<p>Because it’s Akemi-san, if she knew, she would definitely tell Towa-kun and me… So Akemi-san probably doesn’t know about this.</p>



<p>“I’ll have some tea.” </p>



<p>I wanted to calm down a little and had a cup of tea. …… Fuu, it’s delicious.</p>



<p>I poured some tea into my mother’s empty cup as well, and though weakly, she thanked me.</p>



<p>“….Ah.”</p>



<p>And then, something clicked in my mind.</p>



<p>Without hesitation, I voiced everything that came to mind and asked my mother about it.</p>




<p>“Um… Could it be that…?”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“I understand now why you disliked Towa-kun and Akemi-san at first. And then, could it be that you kept telling me to cherish my time with Shu-kun because of your own unrequited feelings for your childhood friend?”</p>



<p>Upon hearing this, my mother visibly shook her shoulders, confirming that my thoughts were correct.</p>



<p>“Seriously, how much more shocking can you get, Mom?”</p>



<p>“Ugh…”</p>



<p>Ugh! No, it’s not like that at all!</p>



<p>So, in the end, it turned out to be nothing more than excessive meddling… Since Shu-kun and I were close friends in the past, my mother, to prevent me from being sad, prioritized Shu-kun above all else by projecting her past self onto me.</p>



<p>“Didn’t you realize it at that time? That I would dislike being told even to spend time with friends for Shu-kun’s sake?”</p>




<p>“…”</p>



<p>“There’s no way you would have noticed, right? Because the result of that is this.”</p>



<p>“Don’t say that!”</p>



<p>“I will. I’ve been at your mercy all this time.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>Oh, it looks like my mom is having an existential crisis…</p>



<p>(But if my mom is like this, then Hatsune-san is… no, she probably just prioritized Shu-kun’s happiness. She’s the type of person who would do anything to make Shu-kun happy, and since she only sees her own family no matter where she goes…)</p>



<p>Because of Hatsune-san’s willingness to do anything to make Shu-kun happy, she prioritized the joy of Shu-kun being happy with me by his side… And Kotone-chan was influenced by that as well, which is the state of that household.</p>



<p>“Thank you for telling me everything.”</p>




<p>For now, I thought that was all I could discuss, so I said that.</p>



<p>My mother let out a sigh of relief, but her expression was still dark… I wonder what Towa-kun would say if he were here at a time like this.</p>



<p>“Ayana…”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>As I was about to return to my room, my mother called out to me.</p>



<p>I noticed that the negative feelings I had towards my mother had suddenly diminished, so I listened intently.</p>



<p>“I… I was wrong. I never wanted to make you unhappy, even though it’s too late to say that now. But I have to say this… I’m truly sorry.”</p>



<p>My mother stood up and bowed her head.</p>



<p>I had never been apologized to like this by my mother before, and I never expected her to bow her head to me.</p>




<p>I stood there for a while, but then I ran to my mother and hugged her.</p>



<p>“It’s really… really too late, Mom.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>“But… I’m glad we could have this conversation. I’m the one who should apologize for saying I hated being related to you by blood.”</p>


<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/image-07.jpg"/>


<p>I don’t really regret that statement. But… as a child raised by my mother, I owe her a lot, and it’s not wrong to say that I’ve been loved and cared for by her… So, I apologized.</p>



<p>“Ayana…!”</p>



<p>“Wupufuu!?”</p>



<p>Suddenly, I was pulled into my mother’s ample bosom.</p>



<p>(Aah… when was the last time I was embraced like this by my mother…? It feels so nostalgic and warm… I guess I can’t truly hate my mother after all.)</p>




<p>At that moment, I had a fleeting memory.</p>



<p>In the face of a man hurling abuse, my mother stared back at him with unwavering determination in her eyes… embracing me tightly to protect me.</p>



<p>(I don’t know much about my father, and I never really thought to ask my mother… I’m not sure if this memory holds any significance, but maybe I don’t need to inquire about it.)</p>



<p>With that conclusion in mind, I continued to be held by my mother for a while.</p>



<p>“Mom, are you done now?”</p>



<p>“No… It’s been ages since I hugged Ayana like this.”</p>



<p>“That’s right. If my memory serves me correctly, it was around the upper grades of elementary school, wasn’t it?”</p>



<p>“So long…?”</p>



<p>Although I felt sorry for the bewildered expression on my mother’s face, I was confident in my assertion.</p>




<p>While I often received praise and affectionate pats on the head, being embraced like this was truly a rare occurrence.</p>



<p>“Mom, let’s talk again another time. I’m a bit tired today…”</p>



<p>“Ara, really?”</p>



<p>“Yes… I’ll take a thirty-minute nap.”</p>



<p>To be honest, I’ve been feeling sleepy for a while now. Maybe it’s because I was nervous about talking to my mother, and now that I’ve found a better resolution than I expected, I feel relieved.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun said he wants to get along with you, Mom. He said it’s not good for our relationship to remain strained forever. So, I’ll make sure to make time… Please talk to Towa-kun and face him properly.”</p>



<p>With that final message, I returned to my room.</p>



<p>“…I wonder if my words reached her.”</p>



<p>At the very least, she’s different from how she was before.</p>




<p>That alone is evidence that my words resonated with her, even if they were harsh at times.</p>



<p>I’ve always found it hard to forgive my mother.</p>



<p>But now that I’ve decided to accept the past and move forward… I can forgive her.</p>



<p>“If Towa-kun and I, along with Mom and Akemi-san, can get along…”</p>



<p>With that wish in mind, I lay down on the bed for a nap.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>“Well then, here I am.”</p>



<p>Without making any detours, I arrived at Ayana’s house. Although there is also Shu’s house nearby, I was careful not to get caught by their family to avoid any trouble… I hope I didn’t seem too suspicious.</p>



<p>“No, no, I wasn’t behaving that suspiciously, so I think I’m safe.”</p>



<p>Nevertheless… nevertheless!</p>



<p>Standing before me is the towering fortress… I mean, Ayana’s house. Ayana should be inside… and maybe Seina-san too?</p>



<p>“Since Ayana doesn’t have her phone with her, I can’t contact her… and since I’ve already come this far, there’s no turning back.”</p>



<p>Taking about ten seconds to compose myself, I took a deep breath… and then rang the doorbell.</p>



<p>“… “</p>




<p>I swallowed nervously, preparing myself for whatever might happen… and then the door opened.</p>



<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting.… ah”</p>



<p>The person who emerged was not Ayana, but her mother, Seina-san. With long black hair like Ayana’s, wrapped in a black knitted sweater that accentuated her ample figure, and a face that closely resembled Ayana’s… just like my own mother, she looked young enough to pass for a college student.</p>



<p>“Hello. I’ve come to deliver something Ayana forgot.”</p>



<p>I… think I did well. Even though I knew Seina-san was here, and even though I expected to see her, I couldn’t help feeling a little nervous when she was actually in front of me.</p>



<p>It’s not like I’m scared or anything, but not knowing what she might say is unexpectedly making it difficult to respond. It’s a typical example of being at a loss for words.</p>



<p>“You….”</p>



<p>I probably wouldn’t have expected anyone to come visit either.</p>



<p>Well, even if I were in Seina-san’s shoes, I would likely have a similar reaction, and it’s certain that I’m one of the last people anyone would expect to come knocking on their door.</p>




<p>(Huh?)</p>



<p>At that moment, as I gazed intently at Seina-san, I noticed something. Her expression was unusually dark, or rather, she seemed troubled.</p>



<p>“Are you okay?”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>That’s why I asked her directly.</p>



<p>“You seem really distressed.”</p>



<p>Honestly, I was prepared to hear her tell me to leave, but seeing her like this made me worry.</p>



<p>…Could it be that Ayana said something to her?</p>



<p>“I never expected to hear that from you.”</p>




<p>“Are you surprised that I’m worried?”</p>



<p>“Well… for you, I’m probably someone you don’t want to see, right?”</p>



<p>Yes… there’s no way I’d honestly admit that to her face! But… yeah, this might be a good opportunity.</p>



<p>If I were immediately rejected upon arrival, there would be no point in sticking around. But if Seina-san is willing to engage in conversation like this, then it’s a different story.</p>



<p>“To be honest… that might be true. For me, you… well, our meeting and everything that followed wasn’t exactly pleasant.”</p>



<p>“Right.”</p>



<p>“Yes. It’s quite traumatic to be stared at by a young but beautiful woman, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>I remember that moment vividly; it’s already etched into my memory. </p>



<p>The gaze that shifted from Ayana to me at that moment… It was like, in manga terms, being glared at with piercing eyes.</p>




<p>Since Seina-san is Ayana’s mother, she’s incredibly beautiful… So being stared at by such a beauty, I never experienced that before, not even in past lives… It was truly terrifying.</p>



<p>“Traumatic… yes, it is. It wasn’t the kind of gaze one directs at a child… I really was quite hopeless.”</p>



<p>“Um… are you really okay?”</p>



<p>I asked because she seemed seriously affected… What happened to make Seina-san like this? If I had to guess, maybe something happened during the conversation a few days ago, or when Ayana came back and talked to her… Either way, this situation might be a perfect opportunity — an opportunity for her to listen to me.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, can I have a moment to talk to you? Normally, I’d expect to be turned away at the gate, but could you let me take advantage of this situation, just this once?”</p>



<p>“….Fufu, asking to take advantage of it straight out like that.”</p>



<p>She laughed weakly. I felt genuinely sorry for making her feel that way. After taking a deep breath to calm myself, I looked her straight in the eyes and continued.</p>



<p>“I… like Ayana. I like the Ayana who has always been by my side, who helped me through tough times and struggles.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>




<p>“A few days ago, after talking things through, we decided to officially start dating. I should have told you sooner, being Ayana’s mother and all… I’m sorry about that.”</p>



<p>I’ve essentially been keeping Ayana with me for the past few days without properly informing her, so Seina-san must have been worried.</p>



<p>“You should have given me some kind of notice.”</p>



<p>“I guess so… Ayana did send a message saying she was staying over.”</p>



<p>“Ah, now you are saying that… She did say that but also said that I didn’t need to reply. So, I didn’t.”</p>



<p>“I see…”</p>



<p>It’s typical of Ayana to be so straightforward… I smiled a little at the memory. Seina-san’s smile is just like Ayana’s — so beautiful and reminiscent.</p>



<p>“Ayana is… very important to you, isn’t she?”</p>



<p>“Of course. She’s my only daughter.”</p>




<p>Of course she is… I was so captivated by her beautiful smile that I couldn’t help but ask such an obvious question… If I keep thinking like this, Ayana might sense it again.</p>



<p>With the image of Ayana as a demon king tucked away in the back of my mind, I conveyed the words I needed to say.</p>



<p>“In fact, I talked to Ayana about you.”</p>



<p>“About me?”</p>



<p>“Yes — about how I didn’t want to be at odds with you forever, and how I wanted to talk to you no matter how long it took, to get your approval of our relationship.”</p>



<p>“…That’s quite something.”</p>



<p>I nodded, and continued.</p>



<p>“To gain your approval… and beyond that, I want to build a good relationship with you. You’re Ayana’s mother… While it’s possible not to have any connection at all, I think it would be too lonely.”</p>



<p>“Wait…”</p>




<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>“Do you really… feel that way about me?”</p>



<p>“Well… of course I do. Why wouldn’t I?”</p>



<p>Seina-san looked at me with wide eyes.</p>



<p>I find myself wondering if I said something too strange, but there’s really no reason why I wouldn’t want to get along with Seina-san, who is Ayana’s mother.</p>



<p>Well, if I were cursed out every time we met, I might not want to see her, but that’s not always the case… After all, she’s the mother of the girl I love.</p>



<p>“You’re the mother of the girl I love. It would be better to get along with a smile than to keep being at odds… Even if it’s difficult, I want to somehow bring that future closer.”</p>



<p>I continue, addressing Seina-san, who still looks puzzled.</p>



<p>“Even if you don’t accept me, I’ll keep coming to talk until you do. So please be prepared—when it comes to Ayana, I’m persistent.”</p>




<p>This is my declaration to Seina-san.</p>



<p>“…Fufu, you’re relentless.”</p>



<p>Seina-san, who had been staring at me, laughs—not a feeble smile, but a beautiful one reminiscent of Ayana.</p>



<p>“Uhm… Did I say something strange?”</p>



<p>“No, not at all. You’re willing to go so far for the person you love… You’re just like him.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>What is Seina-san talking about?</p>



<p>Her words intrigue me, but then she nods as if suddenly convinced of something and smiles at me, making me wonder what’s going on with her.</p>



<p>She seems to be looking at me, but… it feels like she’s seeing someone else.</p>




<p>Seina-san exhales softly and bows her head to me.</p>



<p>“I’ve been treating you terribly all this time. I was foolish not to know, not to try to understand… I’m sorry. It might seem too late now, but still… please let me apologize— I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>Seina-san’s sudden apology leaves me unable to brush it off with a laugh to lighten the mood… I can feel her seriousness from her demeanor alone.</p>



<p>I didn’t really need an apology, and it’s not fair to compare, but compared to Hatsune-san or Kotone, Seina-san is much better… I didn’t think this apology was necessary, but I’m willing to accept it for Seina-san’s sake.</p>



<p>I hope this will be a turning point for Seina-san to move forward, just like for Ayana and me.</p>



<p>“I understand. I accept your apology.”</p>



<p>“…Thank you, Yukishiro-kun.”</p>



<p>Seina-san, with tears in her eyes, raises her head.</p>



<p>I instinctively take out a handkerchief from my pocket and offer it to her.</p>




<p>(Well, I didn’t know how this would turn out at first, but it seems like it’s settled for now. Is it good enough?)</p>



<p>Seina-san accepts the handkerchief with some hesitation and wipes away her tears.</p>



<p>As I wonder what happened to Ayana in the end… no, I’ll focus on Seina-san for now.</p>



<p>After a while, Seina-san finishes wiping her tears.</p>



<p>“You can keep the handkerchief.”</p>



<p>“Ara, I’ll wash it and return it.”</p>



<p>“It is fine!”</p>



<p>“Is it…? But usually, I should be the one washing it—”</p>



<p>She says as she hands back the handkerchief I offered her, seeming to suggest that such concern is unnecessary. I quickly put it back in my pocket.</p>




<p>“…You’re surprisingly pushy, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>“Pushy…? What do you mean by that?”</p>



<p>“Fufu, I wonder.”</p>



<p>…Ah, once again, Seina-san smiles brightly.</p>



<p>The gesture of putting her hand on her mouth and smiling is truly reminiscent of Ayana, but there was no longer any shadow in Seina-san’s expression.</p>



<p>The smile she wore now, like when we first met and when we ran into each other on the street, was so genuinely radiant that it made me wonder if all those previous expressions were just a lie.</p>



<p>(Now, I wonder if it’s okay to say something like this…)</p>



<p>Leaning into the atmosphere, I felt a bit sneaky as I voiced this suggestion.</p>



<p>“Uhm… Would it be okay if I come here often from now on?”</p>




<p>As I asked, Seina-san nodded without any hesitation.</p>



<p>“Of course. Though it might seem convenient now, I’d be more than happy if it means being able to see Ayana’s smile up close. And more than anything, I want to get to know you better too. You’re the person Ayana has come to love.”</p>



<p>“Ah… Yes! Thank you very much!”</p>



<p>For a moment, I wondered if I should say something about redemption, but maybe she thought it wouldn’t be right to apologize anymore.</p>



<p>Yeah… I’ve already accepted Seina-san’s apology, so I don’t need any further apologies.</p>



<p>“Yukishiro-kun, please let me talk to your mother sometime. I have to apologize to her too.”</p>



<p>“Uh… Yeah, anytime should be fine. My mom… even said something like, ‘If you need it, I’ll patch things up with her,’ you know?”</p>



<p>“… Is that so?”</p>



<p>Well, it’s pretty surprising or dumbfounding.</p>




<p>Even though she was so furious on my behalf, she’s also thinking about moving on from the past, just like Ayana and I are… I’m just overflowing with happiness at the thought of everything being resolved so well!</p>



<p>“Anyway! I’m really happy… I didn’t expect things to be resolved so nicely.”</p>



<p>“That’s right… although it’s a bit too easy for me to agree to this. After all, I’m the one who kept dragging the past along.”</p>



<p>…I’m sorry, Seina-san.</p>



<p>I find myself doubting whether it’s really Seina-san with all these submissive gestures… yeah.</p>



<p>Today alone, my impression of Seina-san has changed so much.</p>



<p>Though she must be surprised or confused, Ayana’s expression changed to sharp eyes as soon as she saw me, but then quickly turned to a puzzled expression when she looked at Seina-san.</p>



<p>And that’s because the Seina-san by my side is radiating such a calm atmosphere.</p>



<p>“It was Ayana’s phone that she forgot, huh? Indeed, from your position, Yukishiro-kun, if you don’t have a way to contact Ayana, coming here directly is the only option.”</p>




<p>“Well, I could have waited until school, but still, it’s inconvenient without my phone, you know? And besides, smartphones are expensive!”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I suppose so.”</p>



<p>Seina-san laughs, saying that Ayana is also surprisingly clumsy, and I laugh as if taken in by that.</p>



<p>The look on Ayana’s face with her eyes widening and her mouth opening was so refreshing…I’ve probably never seen a face like this before.</p>



<p>I thought it would be enjoyable to continue gazing in that direction, but then Seina-san called out to me.</p>



<p>“Yukishiro-kun… Would it be alright if I called you Towa-kun too?”</p>



<p>“I don’t mind at all!”</p>



<p>“Thank you, Towa-kun… Are you leaving already?”</p>



<p>“Uhm… I’m fine for a while longer, but why?”</p>




<p>“Well, would you mind staying a bit longer for a chat? Since Ayana woke up like this, I thought it would be nice for all of us to be together.”</p>



<p>“Is it okay? Then I’d be happy to join!”</p>



<p>“Please come in. Now, shall I prepare some tea?”</p>



<p>Prompted by Seina-san, I entered Ayana’s house for the first time.</p>



<p>…Ah, right… This is the first time I’ve ever stepped into Ayana’s house… It’s quite emotionally profound, you know?</p>



<p>As I took off my shoes and stepped into the hallway, Ayana spoke up.</p>



<p>“What on earth happened!? Am I still asleep and just dreaming!?”</p>



<p>If her expression from earlier was truly her first time showing it, then her voice was loud enough to disturb the neighborhood, so let’s say that.</p>



<p>(…I did it!)</p>




<p>By taking action, I could steer the future in a positive direction once again… That’s what I came to realize once more, in a good way.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>[Third Person View]</strong></p>



<p>In “I Was Robbed of Everything,” while there were several mysteries, most of them were revealed and explained through the fan disc, which primarily focuses on Ayana’s story. One of the mysteries raised was this:</p>



<p>“Why was Seina-san, who was also a target of Ayana’s hatred, unharmed?”</p>



<p>Some players of the game murmured this question, and although it was lightly touched upon in the fan disc, the developers later posted a statement on the game’s official website:</p>



<p>[Seina-san was indeed included among Ayana’s targets for revenge, but her status as Ayana’s mother proved to be an obstacle. Additionally, Ayana later learned that her own mother had a connection to Towa-kun’s father from their childhood. Learning this, she saw similarities between herself and her mother, and also discovered that Seina-san had protected her when she was young. This led Ayana to refrain from seeking revenge against Seina-san and ultimately forgive her.]</p>



<p>That was all that was said about why Seina-san remained unharmed. Even if Ayana was consumed by hatred, there was still a lingering sense of filial piety in her heart… While some players may have thought this was naive or wanted her to take action, Ayana ultimately did not harm Seina-san.</p>



<p>Although it’s not known what happened to Seina-san afterwards, perhaps there is a future where Ayana reconciles with her.</p>



<p>“But, well… That’s just like Ayana, isn’t it?… She’s a kind soul.”</p>




<p>You’ll understand if you play—the essence of Ayana is her kindness. Despite being constantly portrayed as someone who suppresses her feelings and is driven by revenge for the sake of her loved one, Ayana’s true nature is her unwavering kindness… Although that kindness also harbors a deep, almost terrifying, complexity.</p>



<p>“Ah, the comments are still going.”</p>



<p>A man muttered and focused on a particular comment.</p>



<p>[By the way, this isn’t mentioned in the fan disc, but Ayana didn’t orchestrate her revenge entirely on her own. She certainly had the determination to carry it out, but… she’s still a high school girl, you know. Of course, she had help.]</p>



<p>Who were the collaborators who assisted Ayana in her revenge…? That’s the question.</p>



<p>[It’s unnecessary to reveal that… I’ll talk about it someday when I feel like it.]</p>



<p>“Why?!”</p>



<p>The man’s retort was filled with frustration. Apart from him, there were likely many others who wanted to know this secret… Perhaps the opportunity to learn it would come when the developers felt like it, or in some unrealistic scenario like being reincarnated into the world of the game.</p>



<p>“Who could be Ayana’s collaborator… I wonder.”</p>




<p>Perhaps there was a hint in the main story or the fan disc, so the man launched the game. However, in the end, it was only natural that no hints were found.</p>
