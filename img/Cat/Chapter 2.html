<h1>Chapter 2: Patchwork Obsession</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I loved my dad.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He knew everything I
didn't know and was always there to protect me. Someone I truly admire.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I felt at ease under
his big hands that stroked me, and I was happy to have been born with hair the
same color as his.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">My first memories as a
child are the sensation of my body being rocked by the carriage, the clear
wind, and the endless plains of withered grass. I remember my eyes often
glancing up at the dust and sand smoke that rose up in the air.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Spending my days
traveling with my parents, who were both adventurers. That was my life when I
was a child.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">My parents were always
on good terms with each other and never had a single quarrel.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They were both
well-educated and skilled in the martial arts, and they fought off many
powerful demonic beasts with their well-matched combination of skills.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">My parents were always
requested by various people by name, and at the same time, they were highly
appreciated.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I was proud of them,
and I did not doubt that one day I would learn from them and become a
first-rate adventurer. But those days didn't last forever.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">My father ......
passed away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">How did he die, what
was the cause? I still don't know.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But I do remember that
shortly before he died, my mother argued with him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No, it was more like a
one-sided confrontation.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">We were on our way
from town to town when the trees and grass had fallen asleep. As I drifted off
to sleep in our camp tent, I was awakened by my mother's strong tone of voice.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What the heck
are you thinking!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I peeked out through a
gap in the tent and saw my mother there, who was unusually loud and impatient.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Dad answered all of
Mom's questions, then apologetically hugged her and whispered something in her
ear.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just what did he say,
I wonder? My mother's eyes widened and she burst into tears.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then she bit her lip
sadly and hung her head, not pressing my father any further.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mom, who was always
smiling and cheerful and never showed any signs of weakness, cried. I felt a
tightening sensation in my chest upon seeing it, and I involuntarily walked out
of the tent.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa .......
Were you awake?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Their eyes widened
when they noticed me coming out.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey, I got an
urgent job to do. Dad has to go."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"E...... a,
uh......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Wait, what happened?
Why is Mom crying?</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">My head was quickly
filled with one question after another, my bad premonition grew even worse, and
my heart was beating fast with shivers as if my whole body was frozen. My mouth
kept flailing in impatience to say something, and as if I had forgotten what to
say, I only uttered meaningless noises.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't worry,
I'll be right back."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After gently patting
me, who was anxious and dismayed, Dad went away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A month later, he came
back stone cold.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">How? Why? My young
mind was crushed by a reality I did not want to believe. And even though I
tried to find out the cause, I was never able to figure it out.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And my uncontrollable
anger and anxiety were directed toward my mother, who let my father go alone.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Why didn't Mom go with
Dad like she usually did?</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But that anger
eventually subsided. A new life was being born in Mom's belly.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A few months later,
Mom gave birth to my sister and we returned to her homeland.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Principality of
Handora. A neighbor of the great Kingdom of Forsina and a member of the Union
of Small Nations.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">We moved to Oire
village in this country.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I didn't know the
cause of my father's death. Mom won't say anything either. All that remained
was my longing for my father. My dream of becoming an adventurer. And then I
met him, who supported my dream.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu Bountis. My
first friend in Oire village. He was the only son of a farmer in this village,
perhaps because of his curiosity, and he seemed to enjoy listening to my
stories about my travels.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Since then, we spent
several years in this village. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Oire village is a
small village in the mountains, where all the villagers usually work together
to do the farm work. So, we became friends very quickly.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But since when did I
become conscious of him?</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A bolt of lightning
flashed across my vision, and at the same time, I saw a scene I had never
imagined before.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In a forest shrouded
in twilight. Most likely Spasim Forest.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As I hide in the thick
vegetation, I stifle my breath and stare at the scene in front of me.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Two childhood friends.
One is someone I once loved.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu Bountis. The
bastard who betrayed me and then threw my feelings for him away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The other is Ken
Notice. The one who supported me when I was in the depths of depression.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">These two were facing
each other and having a talk in such a deserted place. What was the reason
...... I wonder?</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Just what are
they doing ......?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Feeling anxious, I
leaned forward to eavesdrop on their conversation.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">*Shock*. Then, with
another bolt of lightning, the scene in front of me changed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A terrifying monster
attacked. A pitch-black monster with red eyes. It raised its sword in a slow
arc and swung it down at my loved one.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"............!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a cry, I
intercepted the sword flash and caught it with the saber I had drawn.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For some reason, the
loud voice that should have come out of my own mouth did not reach my ears.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The monster's gaze
turned to me as I interrupted it. Its red eyes, stained with hatred, were
filled with disappointment and disdain.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[......!]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The monster's voice
sounded muffled, and I could not understand what it was saying. No, all the
sounds around me were distant, and all I could hear was the ringing in my ears.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But I know what its
gaze was saying.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Why are you protecting
the one who betrayed you? He said.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What is this monster
saying? </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">You are the one who
betrayed me......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(Huh? Why am I saying
that this monster betrayed me......)</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">An enemy that attacked
us. A monster that can do nothing but kill people. Why would I feel
inexplicable feelings of "betrayal" toward such an existence?</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Doubts suddenly popped
up in my mind. As if perceiving this, the monster quickly brought its face
close to mine.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The monster's face in
front of me changed into the shape of Nozomu.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[You actually knew
everything, didn't you? When I gave you that letter?]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Hearing these words,
my eyebrows twitched. My heart jumped and I gulped.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the back of my
mind, I remember the scene of Nozomu who came to give me the letter in the
joint class before the Special Comprehensive Training.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I'm sure that Nozomu
at that time had the same straightforward eyes as the man I've known for a long
time......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(~, What nonsense are
you spouting!? You monster!)</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I put all my strength
into my saber to cut down the traitorous monster.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I'm sure it was all a
mistake. Because I saw him throwing away his promise!</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Was that really the
case?]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The monster once again
questions me. For some reason, his voice has changed to that of a woman.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Sure, you saw him
with another woman and immediately confronted him. But was that really him?]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Yes, of course it was!
I saw something unbelievable! That was definitely Nozomu! And he denied the
fact that I had seen him, out of his mouth!</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I was so emotional
that I spat out those words. As if mocking me, the monster shook his shoulders.</span></span></p>

changed again. Red hair spread out from behind the black-tinted shadow, and a
new appearance was revealed from within the shadow. The face was ...... exactly
the same as mine.</span></span></p>

welled up in me. At the same time, I was struck by a feeling of realization.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I glared at the
monster in front of me and put strength into my arms, trying to deny my own
feelings.</span></span></p>

at my resistance.</span></span></p>

brightly......</span></span></p>

whisper that slipped in, I was about to turn my gaze away from the monster.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I must not turn
around...... Even though I thought so, my eyes were looking back before I knew

wearing Ken's mask.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In front of my stunned
eyes, the black monster jerked and attacked me.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Before I had time to
let out a scream, I was swallowed from behind by the shadow monster.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A feeling of disgust
and rejection, incomparably more intense than when I had just witnessed the
monster's transformation, assaulted my entire body. At the same time, my entire
body began to be invaded by the shadow.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(......~, ~!!)</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps amused even by
my resistance, the shadow that had swallowed me trembled with ecstasy as it
devoured my body, little by little.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Suddenly, something
touches the side of my face. I looked to the side and saw Ken's mask, which had
approached me as if to creep up on me. His face was distorted, as though he
were a little child who had acquired his favorite toy.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[What a weak woman.

along with the shadow of my crime.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was still dark
outside the window, and the sun was just beginning to shine on the roofs of the
houses that lined the street. Lisa gasped for air and pressed her chest against
the choking sensation.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At the same time, she
felt an intense headache. The pain felt as if she had been hit over and over
again with a hammer from behind her head, and she involuntarily slumped over on
the bed. Her long hair hung down, and her eyelids were tightly closed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A flash of light shone
in the back of her eyes. As she remained slumped for a while, Camilla, who was
sleeping on the bed next to her, woke up and called out to her.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa, what's
wrong?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Camilla.
No, it's nothing. I'm sorry I woke you."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Pushing back the pain
running through her head, she looked up and smiled. Camilla and Lisa have been
roommates since freshman year, and have become close friends through that
relationship. And Camilla is one among those who has always supported her. So
Lisa didn't want to make her worry.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's fine, it's
time to get up anyway. Another nightmare?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After a few seconds of
silence, Lisa gave a small nod, defeated by Camilla's gaze directed at her.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Un."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She started having
nightmares. They were supposed to be dreams that would eventually fade away,
and yet they stuck to her mind and devoured her over and over again. Not only
while she was sleeping, but also sometimes during small gaps in his daily life.
Even last night, she woke up five times. Completely sleep-deprived. She
probably looks terrible right now.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The dream depicted a
scene of Nozomu, who had summoned her to the forest, arguing with Ken.
Eventually, they began slashing at each other, and a light blue dwarfish
creature appeared beside Ken, who was cornered, and restrained Nozomu.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As he fell to the
ground, Ken looked down at him with the most twisted smile one could ever see.
At that moment, an incredible amount of power overflowed from Nozomu's
body.......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......!"</span></span></p>

far, she shook her head to rid herself of her imagination.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Things never happened
that way in the first place. Even though he summoned me with a letter, that man
never showed up after all.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(But ....... Why do I
remember my dreams so clearly after seeing them so many times......?)</span></span></p>

are usually forgotten by the end of the day. Even if they are remembered, they
soon become full of holes like insect bites, and within a few days, they are
completely erased from memory, never to be seen again.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But her nightmares
were bizarrely vivid and did not disappear no matter how much time passed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">On the contrary, they
became more and more bloated and irritating.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What shall we

somehow gotten off the bed and come to her side, looked at her with a worried
expression.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-I'm fine. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her words were
surprisingly empty and helpless.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ignoring the lingering
fatigue, she went to the wardrobe and began to get dressed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She wanted to escape
Camilla's gaze on her back. She wanted to forget the nightmare she had just
had.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But that wish was soon
betrayed. Because [that guy] was waiting for her when she stepped out of the

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu, the owner of
this room, was getting ready for school in a brisk manner.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The town was still
enveloped in dim darkness. It was clearly too early. He dressed in his school
uniform and was about to put his katana at his waist......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......!"</span></span></p>

suddenly ran up his arm made him wince. He frowned at the numbness that
suddenly ran up his arm. He put strength into his arm, which was about to drop
the katana.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He managed to put it
strapped to his waist without dropping his master's memento.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That was-......

subsided and the sensation returned. Nozomu could guess what was causing this
numbness. Last night, too, he had dreamed of the Dragon King.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Phew.......

Although the anxiety lingered, it quickly calmed down.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After checking his
appearance and steeling himself, Nozomu left his room with a bag containing his
breakfast and study materials that he had prepared in advance.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Upon leaving the
dormitory, Nozomu headed north. The border between the civil and administrative
districts. There, he found the building he was heading for.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Solminati Academy
girls' dormitory. Nozomu waited for the person in question to come out of the

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Female students came
out of the entrance of the dormitory one after another. When they saw Nozomu in
front of the girls' dormitory, they all tilted their heads in unison. Waiting
in a place like this would naturally attract attention.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, Nozomu paid
no heed to their stares and kept his eyes fixed on the front gate of the girls'
dormitory.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, the expected
person appeared.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa, are you
all right?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Like I said, I'm
fine......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There stood two girls,
Lisa with a somewhat gloomy expression on her face, and Camilla, who was
standing by her side showing concern for her.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The face of Lisa was
pale and she had dark circles under her eyes. She was obviously sleep-deprived.
Despite his concern about her condition, Nozomu shifted his mind and walked
over to them.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You......!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla wore a
surprised expression, then stepped in between Lisa and Nozomu as if to protect
her.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But her eyes wavered
erratically and lacked composure.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She, too, was one of
the people who had framed Nozomu, but at the same time, she was carrying some
special circumstances. Nozomu took a deep breath to relax himself, then slowly
opened his mouth to Lisa and Camilla.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa, it's been
a while. I believe it's been about two weeks?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The voice that came
out of his mouth as he faced them once again was calmer than Nozomu himself had
expected.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So do you,
Camilla. Though I lost myself in anger in the forest, sorry about that."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"How......?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(......Yep, my mind is
calm.)</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Facing them like this,
Nozomu came to realize something. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His anger did not well
up anymore.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla probably did
not expect to be spoken to in such a calm tone. She was surprised by Nozomu's
quiet and calm voice. Her eyes widened.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A-A-......."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, on the other
hand, Lisa's behavior was strange. Her complexion had gone pale. Her eyes were
unfocused and wide open.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her expression did not
seem to indicate that she was okay.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Another important
person also appeared here.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-Why are you
here ......!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ken,
huh......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken was so surprised
to see Nozomu here that his face contorted into an ugly smile for a moment, but
then he immediately smiled as usual. After that, he ignored Nozomu and walked
toward Lisa.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Good morning
Lisa. Sorry, I'm late. It must be a disaster to get tangled up with this guy so
early in the morning. Come on, let's go ......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken tried to take
Lisa's hand with a deft gesture, as if he was accustomed to doing so.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"~,
-no......!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Huh?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But the next moment,
slap! With a dry smack, Lisa brushed Ken's hand away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken's face twitched in
pain, followed by a look of disbelief.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa, on the other
hand, also stiffened, her eyes widening at her own actions. Silence fell, as if
time had stood still.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"L-Lisa
......?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A trembling voice
escaped from Ken's mouth. Lisa, also realizing what she had done, her face grew
pale with fear.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"~......!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then she ran away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While Ken was taken
aback by the abruptness of the event, Nozomu hurried after her.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa went from in
front of the main gate of the girls' dormitory to the main street of the civic
district. She was physically talented by nature. By the time Nozomu reached the
main street, Lisa was already on her way into intricate alleyways.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa,
wait!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu called out to
her, but she did not stop, instead, her steps became faster and faster. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If one looked closely,
one could see the residue of magic power covering her body. She was
unconsciously boosting her physical capabilities with her magic power.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Strengthening only by
magic power without any magic spells would not have much effect. But even so,
an ordinary person would easily be shaken off.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At this rate, he would
lose sight of her. Nozomu, who had made this judgment, released his Qi,
strengthened his physical abilities, and pursued after her.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But as he rounded a
few alleys, his eyes widened at the sight of an object blocking his path.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Is this ...... a
wall of water?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A three-meter-high
wall of water towered over the alleyway.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu immediately
sprang up, putting all his Qi into his legs, and leaped. He leaped over the
water wall with his hand on the eaves of the roof of a house.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When the water wall
failed to block Nozomu, it crumbled down with a splashing sound.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But by the time he
landed, it had already reconstructed itself in the direction he was going.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The work of
Ken's contracted spirit, huh?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu, aware of the
entity controlling the water wall, applied his Qi to the katana at his waist
and drew it. With a single stroke, the water wall was cut in half and
collapsed. This time, he broke through the water wall without slowing down.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, the other
party must have decided that a simple wall would not be enough to stop Nozomu.
This time, they took a different approach.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Mist......!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Suddenly, a dense fog
formed around Nozomu. His vision was so white that he could not see a single
meter ahead of him. Naturally, Lisa's back was completely obscured. The next
moment, a huge stone wall rushed in front of Nozomu, who was running.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Damn
it......!!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just before he slammed
into the wall, Nozomu reflexively put his foot on the wall and changed the
direction of forward momentum to upward. He ran up the wall of the house and
onto the roof.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">By the time Nozomu was
on the roof, the fog had dissipated and the gentle spring sunlight was
illuminating the rows of houses.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa was already out
of sight, not a shadow remained.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I lost
her......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He bit his lip and
clenched my fists. But there was one thing he knew.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He had to do something
about that spirit if he wanted to talk to Lisa again. That means he can't do it
on his own.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'll have to
start over......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu looked once
again in the direction in which she would have run away. What came to mind was
the promise he made to support her when he was a little boy.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(A promise that I
clung to in order to escape, a promise that no longer has any meaning. But
still......)</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After closing his eyes
for a moment, Nozomu turned on his heel and jumped down from the roof.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Once again, he held
the once-forgotten determination in his heart.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style=" font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">†</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The civic district
where Nozomu left. In a corner of a damp back alley, there were two figures.
One was Lisa. The other was Ken. If one were to look closely, one could see
another small shadow floating in the air beside the two.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Mefi, are you
not done yet......?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Just a little
more.......]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Its appearance is
reminiscent of a light blue child. Called Mefi, it was a lesser water spirit
who had contracted with Ken.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A light blue source
element flowed from the spirit's hand as it raised toward Lisa, enveloping her
entire body. This power erased the events that had just taken place from her
memory.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What do you
mean? Why is she rejecting me!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken's voice was
hoarse, as if he couldn't stand it any longer. Mefi had created a soundproof
barrier around them so that no one could hear what they were saying, but the
expression on his face was clearly that of someone who was being cornered.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Her memories are
coming back. It wasn't supposed to be like this. ...... Alright, I'm done
resealing her memories."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu sent a letter
saying he wanted to talk to her, and Ken tried to get rid of him. Having seen their
exchange in the forest, Lisa half realized that Ken had tricked her and Nozomu.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Not wanting to let
Lisa go, Ken took measures to seal her memories, but the reversal of the facts
she had believed had devastated her more than Ken had anticipated.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As a result, she had
been seeing her sealed memories repeatedly in the form of nightmares, and even
his spirit's suggestion was becoming ineffective.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Like I said, when you
were in the first year, I told you that you should have just killed him. But
you prolonged it so badly just because you wanted to see him fall, that's why
this happened~~]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken gritted his teeth
at Mefi's words.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The reason Ken decided
to remove Nozomu from Lisa's side was because of the manifestation of Ability
Suppression.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A flashback of his old
days ...... back in his hometown of Oire Village came back to his mind.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Unlike Nozomu, who was
an only child, Ken had many brothers and sisters. There were eight of them.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Including his parents,
he had a large family of ten. Among them, he was the sixth child. He was not as
young as the younger ones, but not as dependable as the older ones. Moreover,
his younger siblings were born in rapid succession, and as soon as he could
remember, his parents and older siblings had already stopped paying attention
to him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He had to take care of
his young siblings, and above all, farm work required manpower. Inevitably, Ken
was expected to do some work ahead of being pampered.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken felt isolated amid
a large family. This cast a shadow over Ken's childhood.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was not that he had
any ill will toward his family. He just happened to be a little out of the
family circle.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He became friends with
Nozomu and Lisa, who were the same age as him.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[What's wrong~~?]</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"............"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The first friend he
made. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The first time he was
not lonely. How comforting that must have been to him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">So it was inevitable
that Ken was attracted to Lisa.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And he knew that
Nozomu and Lisa would be attracted to each other. They were two of his beloved
people.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He was happy for them.
But at the same time, he also felt a stale, comatose feeling.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Why it wasn't
ime? Why did she always look at Nozomu first?</span></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style=" font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">I want her to
look at me</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">. Such small jealousy had been smoldering in his heart for a long time.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was still good in
the past. Ken was rather quiet at that time, and Nozomu was the one who pulled
Ken along.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">So he was able to
express his blessing. He was able to rejoice. Even if there was a small lump in
his heart.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It couldn't be helped.
Somewhere in the back of his mind, he was able to think that way and give up.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was around this
time that he met Mefi. She had repeatedly told Ken that he had talent and that
there was no need to be reserved, but he had always shaken his head at her
words.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But when they came to
Solminati Academy, their positions were reversed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken grew up to be one
of the best students in his grade, while Nozomu fell to the bottom of the
class.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And the jealousy that
had been building up since he was a child began to grow. Before he knew it, the
sight of Nozomu crawling around in the practical class made his heart ache, and
his stomach began to churn every time Lisa stood by him as he was unable to
grow, no matter how hard he tried.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, his growing
jealousy exploded. He took advantage of Camilla, who was close to Lisa at the time,
by holding on to her secret and using it to blackmail her and bring down
Nozomu.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[That being said, what
the hell is that Camilla doing?]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While Ken remained
silent, Mefi complained about Camilla, who had yet to arrive. She had already
sent a telepathy to tell her where they were, so she should have arrived by
now. At that moment, Camilla appeared from the shadows of a back alley.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[What have you been
doing!?]</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"She ran out of
nowhere, so there's no way I can catch up with her easily."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla rushed toward
Lisa, brushing aside Mefi's complaints.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla frowned and
bit her lip at the sight of Lisa standing there unconscious as if she were a
doll.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Forget it.
Mefi, go assimilate with Lisa. The commotion has grown too loud. Now that it's
come to this, you'll need to manipulate Lisa's memories at all times."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[It can't be helped,
huh.]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While Camilla was
shocked upon hearing the word "assimilate," Mefi's body transformed
into a light blue source material and entered into Lisa's body.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"How selfish are
you going to be......!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What a bother.
You're also our accomplice, remember? You sold Nozomu out to save your own
skin."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's because
you- ......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No matter how
you try to fix it, the fact remains. Or do you want to be handed over to your homeland?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Hearing these words,
Camilla's expression, which had been exuding anger, turned completely pale.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"After fleeing
from the Empire to the Free City, how many people sacrificed their lives so
that you could live? Don't act so innocent now. Your mother is dead, what can
you do now that you're alone?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken glanced at
Camilla, whose shoulders were trembling, and left with Lisa, who was
assimilated with Mefi. As the two disappeared into the shadows of the alley,
the barrier that had been deployed around them disappeared.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The silent space
disappeared, and Camilla crumpled to the ground as the bustle of people
streamed in from the main street.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"*Hic hic*
......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Sobs leaked from the
gaps between the palms of her hands that covered her face, and the tears she
could not catch formed a smear on the dimly lit ground.</span></span></p>
