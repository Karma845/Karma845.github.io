<h1>Chapter 3: Rampage at the Martial Arts Garden</h1>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu, Ken,
come quick~~! If you don't hurry, Musil will take over that place!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hold on a sec,
Lisa! Ken's not here yet!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa, haa,
haa...... don't worry, he'll catch up to us later......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">During my days in the
Oire village, I would always race out with Nozomu and Ken after a day's farm
work.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken is a friend of
Nozomu's. His family is also a farmer, but unlike Nozomu, he has a large family
with seven siblings. However, he himself is a man of few words, and I remember
that he seemed quiet when I first met him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Our goal is to reach a
single pine tree on top of a small hill surrounding the village. It is a
playground for the children of the village, where they can play for a short
while after the day's work is done and before the sun sets.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Like the adults, the
children have their own factions and clash over the best place to play.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Under such
circumstances, rules are naturally formed. That is the race to reach the single
pine tree. The first child to get to the top of the hill after the day's work
is done gets to play there until the sun goes down.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yay, we're the
first!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, we're not.
There's someone else up there."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Unfortunately, there
was another kid that day. Behind a lone pine tree, a girl with freckles on her
cheeks was hiding there.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey, isn't that
Mehilya, what are you doing?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, umm ......
I was drawing a picture."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At the feet of the shy
Mehilya was a picture of the Oire village landscape as seen from the top of
this hill.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Roofs of houses
illuminated by the sun, wheat fields just beginning to sprout, and horses, of
which there are only a few in the village, grazing on the side roads of the
fields with their carts loaded with goods. The landscape drawing on the ground
in only shades of brown seemed as if it were cut directly from the landscape
that I saw, as if it were about to start moving.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Amazing .......
I didn't know you could draw such a great drawing!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm a little,
embarrassed ......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mehilya's freckled
cheeks flushed red. I don't think there's any need to be embarrassed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In fact, both Nozomu's
and Ken’s eyes lit up when they saw her drawing.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Tsk, you beat me
to it ......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Right at that moment,
a disturbing voice drifted over the hillside. I turned back toward the path
leading to the village and saw five children, led by a tall, chubby boy. It's
Musil, the village's brat general who gets tangled up with me in all sorts of
ways.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He looks displeased,
as if he is disappointed that we were the first to arrive.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Right. Why don't
you guys just go home?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Who decided
that!? I never said we would leave, did I!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I frowned at Musil's
words. Up until now, if we were ahead of them, Musil and the others would back
off, even though they were swearing at us. But today, they were different.  Their smirking, condescending stares irked
me.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This is our
village and this playground is also ours! We don't need to listen to an
outsider!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The heck, your name
is not even written anywhere in this place. Besides, Mehilya was the first to
arrive here. You're not even number two, and you're not wanted here!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Shut up! I don't
give a damn!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The furious Musil
suddenly shouted out loud and glared at Mehilya, who was hiding behind a tree.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As her shoulders shook
with fear, Musil came up to her and kicked the drawing on the ground. The
lively horses were scraped off, and the scattered dirt crushed the houses
projected on the ground.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wait! What are
you doing!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Shut up, shut
up! Don't tell me what to do! You parentless c*nt!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"~!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Parentless. Hearing
this word, my eyes widened involuntarily. The image of my father's face as he
died flashed back into my mind.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I felt a gouging
sensation deep within my chest, suffocation, and my vision narrowed.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What now
outsider, can't you even talk back? Then, if you understand, get the hell out
of here!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Kya......!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Musil, with a
triumphant look on his face, shoved me away forcefully. I staggered and fell
backward. With the impact, my whole body felt as if I had been stabbed with a
needle, and I involuntarily burst into tears.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"U-Ugh
......!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It hurts......! The
sense of loss that I had forgotten since I came to this village resurfaced, and
the ripples peeled the crusts of my heart away. The pain that ran through me,
the words that were directed at me, made my heart ache and tighten.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">*Crack, crack*......
cracks running all over my body, and my whole body turned cold. And just when
my heart, completely frozen, was about to shatter.......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Motherf*cker!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu shouted loudly
and pounced toward Musil and the others. He grabbed Musil by the chest and
pushed him down with all his might.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The malice directed at
me subsides, and I involuntarily let out a stunned voice. My frozen heart
....... started throbbing.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that moment, Ken
also charged at Musil. The two of them pushed the general to the ground and
began to hit him as hard as they could.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Bwah,
bastard!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Apologize to
Lisa!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Musil also fought back
against the shock and dull pain on his face, but Nozomu and Ken did not stop.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But after they swung a
few fists, the cronies came to their senses and rushed to Nozomu and Ken.
Nozomu and Ken were able to make a few bruises on the faces of the cronies, but
they were eventually outnumbered and pulled away from Musil.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"H-How dare you
......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With the help of his
cronies, Musil stood up unsteadily. He walked over to Nozomu and Ken, his face
red with anger at being hit, determined to repay the blow several times over.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The two were
restrained by his cronies and were unable to move. But they were unfazed and
glared back at Musil.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa's heart, which
had been at a standstill, flared up again at the sight of them.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's enough
...... you orc-nose!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Bbuh!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Leaping from a dash, I
slammed an all-out dropkick into Musil's face. The brat general fell down on
his back, his nose bleeding.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Orc-nose,
she says."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, that face
and nostrils are so broad, both vertically and horizontally, just like an
orc's."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After that, a silly
quarrel between the three of us against the five of them ensued.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa, haha,
i-it's getting late today, so we're going home! We can't deal with this
persistent viper woman!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Musil was the one who
raised his voice. He left with a tired, slurred speech and a sigh of defeat.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Eat that! I've been
traveling with my father and mother, and if I really wanted to, this is what
I'd do!</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa, haa, come
back here! You orc-nose!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"L-Lisa, y-you're
still in good spirits, huh......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Right. We can't
move anymore, how can you be so energetic......?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I was standing at my
feet with my fists clenched toward the sky, and the exhausted Nozomu and Ken
were saying such things to me. Hey, you need to get a grip. Especially you,
Nozomu! Where's the energy you had earlier when you pounced on Musil?</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hm? What is it,
Lisa? Is something wrong?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-It's
nothing!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a dumbfounded
expression, Nozomu, who was looking right up at me, tilted his head. His gesture
and gaze made my cheeks heat up, and my heart started to race. My whole body
trembled, and my throat rapidly became dry.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I wonder what's going
on. I want to look away. I can't look at him squarely in the face.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But if I do, I'm
afraid he'll look at me strangely.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"U-Umm. Thank
you......."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Huh? Ah, don't
worry about it! I couldn't stand it either! And if he does anything weird
again, just tell me. I'll make sure he's gonna get his ass kicked!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While I was intensely
flustered by a sensation I had never felt before, Mehilya, who had been hiding
behind a tree, came out to talk to me. Happily, I turn to her. Incidentally, to
cover up my embarrassment, I made a fist bump gesture.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mehilya smiled and gave
a small nod, perhaps thinking my action was funny, and went back to the
village.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's getting
late......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As Nozomu muttered to
himself, he turned his eyes to the western sky. The sky was already tinged with
red and the sun was about to set behind the mountains. As expected, there would
be no time to play now.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It can't be
helped then. Let's go home for today."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Hearing Ken urging me
to return home, Nozomu nodded.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But I didn't hear
their voices. I look up at the sunset sky in a daze.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Sigh.
Hey, am I still an outsider after all?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Huh?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Musil's [parentless]
word, and my father's dead face that I remembered, naturally made my expression
cloud over.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I found myself saying
those words to both of them.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"My father. He
was an adventurer and took me to many places. The water lake city of Abrues,
the capital of Garsam, and so on......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As I looked at the
village spread out below me, the memories of my father's adventures naturally
flowed out of my mouth.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Oire village is a
peaceful place. A peaceful life that I could not have imagined when I was
traveling. But as an outsider, I can't help but feel a sense of a gap.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I really had fun
when I was traveling. Although there were times when I couldn't eat a full meal,
I was still able to see so many sparkling things."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Sandy beaches shine
like the light of stars that have fallen to the ground, and plains that stretch
on forever. The wide variety of people gathering in the cities.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that time,
everything seemed new and shining.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Certainly, as
adventurers, our income was not stable, and there were days when we felt cold.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even so, both Mom and
Dad were always smiling, and every day was a time of true happiness.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But after Dad
died, Mom couldn't feed us by herself anymore ...... That's why we came to this
village."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The death of my
father, an adventurer and someone I depended on more than anyone else.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was just around the
time when the movements of the demonic beasts became more active and anxiety
about the invasion began to rise again in various places. Naturally, everyone
was preparing for the re-emergence of the Great Invasion.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">People's hearts and
minds gradually began to wither in the face of the spreading and growing
anxiety, and the economy, people's minds, and everything else began to be
pulled in a negative direction. At such a time, my mother could not go on an
adventure with me and my newborn sister in her arms. That was why she decided
to return to her hometown.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"We are certainly
not in any danger here. I can always sleep in a warm bed, and I don't have to
freeze in the cold. But......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Oire village was
hardly affected by the Great Invasion. No houses were destroyed by demonic
beasts, nor were they attacked by people who fell to banditry. Although there
was some crop failure, we did not suffer from famine to the point of
starvation.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But something is
missing. I always get the feeling that there is a small hole in my heart and my
passion is draining out of me. I clasp my hands tightly over my chest to plug
the hole.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa, do you
want to be like your father?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I nod in response to
Nozomu's words.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I remember the warmth
of my father's hand, that great warmth that I felt when I could not sleep
because I was afraid of the darkness of the night or the howling of demonic
beasts during the journey. That heat continues to smolder in the depths of my
body, along with the numerous landscapes my father had shown me during our
journey.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... It'll be
all right, Lisa. Once you grow up, it won't be a problem. You can go on a
journey, and I'm sure your mother won't be opposed to you becoming an
adventurer like your father was."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's right.
Since your mother was also an adventurer, I don't think she would be opposed to
it."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu and Ken
responded optimistically and without logic, as children often do. I know their
words are groundless, but for me at least, what I needed right then was not a
clear reason, but someone to push me forward.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes, that's
right. I can be. Like my dad......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The spark of longing
for the past that had remained in the depths of my heart was ignited by the
approval of my childhood friends.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yep, I've made
up my mind. I will become an adventurer!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That was the moment I
decided to become an adventurer.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I wanted to see that
scene I had once seen. Perhaps, if I became an adventurer, I might be able to
experience something even more exciting than that.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I have nothing to hide
anymore. Even if I had no reason or rationale for it, the desire was already
lying deep in my heart.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"My father once
told me. He said that people from all over the world are gathering together to
build a big city. In that city, they are building a big school where you can
study things you don't know on the whole continent!</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From that moment on, I
decided to go to the Soluminati Academy and to study for it.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Once again, I looked
back at Nozomu and Ken.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu, thank
you."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"N-No. I'm glad I
could help."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When I thanked Nozomu
for making me aware of my dream, for some reason he blushed and his voice
trembled.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He seemed nervous. But
for some reason, I am also feeling nervous in my chest.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I was embarrassed to
make eye contact with him. That had never happened to me before.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To cover up my
embarrassment, I turned my attention to Ken, who was standing next to Nozomu.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ken, thanks for
helping me out, too."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"U-Un......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken was also somewhat
awkward, but compared to Nozomu, I felt much more at ease talking to him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Apparently, the
embarrassment was only applies to Nozomu.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-Well, it's
late, let's go home now."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">My heart was beating
quietly, but strongly. Sweet and sour feelings kept welling up. The three of us
started our way home, raising our voices to cover it up.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style=" line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And at the same time,
I became conscious of the man who made me aware of my dream.</span></span></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>‡</strong></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Having lost track of
Lisa, Nozomu had no choice but to head toward the school.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Passing through the
civic district and around the central park, he arrived at the main gate of the
academy on the south side. At the gate, Mars had arrived and was waiting for
him.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yo Nozomu,
you're late."</span></span></p>

just a little something to do in the morning......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When Nozomu shrugged
his shoulders, Mars replied with a curt, "I see", and the two headed for
the classroom.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He must have guessed a
lot from their conversation at the Ox-head Pavilion the other day. So Nozomu
was grateful for his silence.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The majority of the
students had already arrived at school, and the number of students walking down
the hallway was sparse. However, when all the students saw Nozomu, they all
frowned and began whispering behind his back.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The content of the few
conversations that circulated was not very pleasant.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, when Mars
glared at them, they stopped talking and quickly hid themselves away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Stunned yet grateful
for his best friend's actions, Nozomu made his way to their classrooms.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When he arrived at the
hallway lined with third-grade classrooms, he was once again met with countless
stares.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu thought it was
another rumor involving Lisa, but he noticed that the intensity of the stares
was different.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Say,
Nozomu. Is there something wrong with the atmosphere at the school?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, the whole
school, or rather the whole area where the classrooms of the third grade are
located, has a strange atmosphere. I wonder why?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The two arrived at
their classroom and opened the door, while tilting their heads at the
unexplained atmosphere.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Inside the classroom,
their classmates were studying on their own, talking with friends, and doing
whatever they wanted.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, the moment
Nozomu entered the classroom, the eyes of the students in the class suddenly
focused on him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They looked at him
with doubt, confusion, disbelief, and curiosity. Nozomu was slightly flinched
by the pressure.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But when Nozomu
glanced back at each of his classmates, the ones whose eyes met his, for some
reason, looked flustered and averted their gazes. Then, as if to make up for
it, they resumed their self-study or started talking with their friends again.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-What in the
world is this ......?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Who knows?

don't know either......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, this is
because of the last Special Comprehensive Exercise."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jin. And Deck
and the others, good morning."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There were five
classmates, Jin, Hamuria, Deck, Tommy, and Cami. They had previously formed a
party together in the last Special Comprehensive Exercise. Since that exercise,
they had become one of the few classmates who talked to Nozomu normally.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"By the way, Jin,
there's something strange going on in the classroom, what do you mean by this
being caused by the Special Comprehensive Exercise?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, it would
be faster if you take a look at it. This way."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Urged by Jin, Nozomu
and Mars went to the back of the classroom. There was a small blackboard with a
variety of notices posted on it. Jin pointed to a corner of the board.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Here,

result of the Special Comprehensive Exercise?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes, look at our

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There, the scores and
rankings of each party were posted. Nozomu's eyes widened involuntarily when he
saw their scores written there.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Sixth place

I see, so
that's why the atmosphere at the school was so strange since this
morning."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mars muttered in an
understanding manner.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was unprecedented
in this Soluminati Academy for the lowest 10th class to be ranked in the top
10.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Moreover, the party
was led by two well-known inferior students in the school.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">One was a regular
attendee of the supplementary examinations, known as the bottom of the barrel.
The other was a problem child who was treated as a hazardous material that
could explode at any moment.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Considering their
reputations up to now, it was not surprising to see the surrounding people's
reaction to this result.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nevertheless, of
course, there are people who don't seem to believe it. ......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oi, bottom
feeder. What the hell did you do in the Special Comprehensive Exercise?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Amidst all this, there
was one person who spoke to Nozomu in a questioning tone, raising his voice. He
walked toward Nozomu, his shoulders shaking with anger, as if he couldn't take
it anymore.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"O-Oi, Simnal.
Calm down."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His friend tried to
stop him, but the strong suspicion in the eyes of his classmate, called Simnal,
remained.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There is no way
you could achieve such a result! What kind of dirty tricks did you use!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I didn't
though......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's right. I
was with Nozomu-kun throughout the exercise, and afterward, he was injured and
couldn't move for more than a week due to his injuries. How can he possibly do
any cheating?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In response to
Nozomu's voice, Jin and the others concurred. Surprisingly, Jin and the others
refuted him in a stronger tone.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Then how did you
win!? The opponents you defeated were not only the 8th class and 9th class, but
also the 4th class! And on top of that, to even beat a special target, that's
just plain abnormal!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"We've told you
many times, Nozomu-kun, you did not cheat. The reason why we can win is because
he fully understands the terrain, has a solid strategy, and also has prepared a
backup plan. And he was the one who came up with it all."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Besides we've
seen Nozomu in class many times fighting against Mars. He is much stronger than
we thought."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu felt
embarrassed by the trusting glances he was receiving from Jin and the others
and couldn't help but scratch his cheeks.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In fact, Nozomu and
Mars have often teamed up in practical classes since they entered the third
grade. He refrained from using Qi-jutsu because it would be overkill, but he
still had many opportunities to showcase his swordsmanship.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Do you think you
can get away with it......?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, even their
words couldn't reach Simnal. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Instead, he became
more stubborn, and the intensity of his anger rose drastically.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu, on the other
hand, was quietly staring at Simnal, despite the growing tension in his
surroundings.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The anger directed at
him. Even though he understood that it was one-sided and unreasonable anger,
yet Nozomu felt some sympathy for him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps it was because
Nozomu and Simnal had something in common.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They turn their
dissatisfaction toward reality into anger and rant about it, seeking to blame
it on somewhere else, or blocking their eyes so as not to see the fact that
things have changed. It was the same behavior as that of Nozomu until recently.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, Nozomu's calm
stance only added to Simnal's impatience and anger.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"~, Damn
you!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"O-Oi,
Simnal!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As if to shake off
reality, Simnal tried to grab hold of Nozomu.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Simnal's actions
caused his friends, who were watching behind him, to change color. It was not a
good idea to resort to violence, no matter how much it might cost. But as if
inspired by this hostility, Nozomu moved.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In an instant, he
kneaded his Qi and slid to the side, brushing away Simnal's outstretched hands.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He then twisted the
outstretched hands to restrain them.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ugh......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Simnal's eyes widened
in surprise as a sharp sword-Qi struck him from close range. His body suddenly
lost its strength, and he fell to the ground on his butt.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Ah~!
S-Sorry."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There, Nozomu finally
realized his reflexive action and removed his hand, while expressing his
apology. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The air in the
classroom, which had been tense, relaxed at the unexpected action of someone
who normally did not need to apologize.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu, sorry.
He and I were both a little impatient because our results from the Special
Exercise were not good."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Simnal's friend, who
had been standing behind him, stepped forward while nudging him in the head.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Upon hearing the
story, it seemed that their party was caught up in a fierce battle right after
the exercise started, and they were defeated without being able to do anything.
Although it was inevitable due to the school's system, Simnal himself had not
performed well enough to ensure his continued enrollment at the school, and he
was very determined to do well in the Special Comprehensive Exercise, but this
was the result.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Come on,
apologize, Simnal."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"S-Sorry......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Simnal looked away
awkwardly and bowed his head. Thanks to the pressure and the fact that he was
being defended by his friend, he seemed to have cooled down at once. Nozomu
didn't mind as long as he apologized.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Umm, forgive us
for bothering you, but would you mind telling us how you survived the Special
Exercise?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu, why
don't you just tell them? They don't seem to want to rant about it
anymore."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Alright. I
understand."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu nodded at Mars,
who had been watching the situation from behind Nozomu. There was nothing to
hide.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Finding a simple base,
then split the party into two to gain points. In the process, they were
attacked by a special target, Anri-sensei. Although overwhelmed, Hamuria, who
was a rear guard mage, rushed in while being protected by a magic barrier,
taking Anri-sensei by surprise that a rear guard should not be charging into
the front line. While Anri-sensei being restrained, Nozomu destroyed her
pendant, which was proof of participation in the exercise, thus defeating her.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What a walk on a
tightrope strategy, huh......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"We had no other
choice. It was difficult for us to win a head-to-head battle, not to mention
alone, even if we combined our numbers together. Then, in order to win, we must
catch our opponent by surprise."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, it is also
true that one cannot win by surprise alone. What is important is how to bring
them into a situation where they can take advantage of their strengths.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Indeed...... so,
how did you do that?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"We blocked her
vision with a cloud of dust a few times, and then Deck and I repeatedly charged
at her, making her think it was only the two vanguards that were going to rush
forward."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey, I have one
more question......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu answered each
question one by one carefully. Before one knew it, a crowd had gathered around
Nozomu and the others, making it look like a small lecture.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They, too, had been
called failures by students of other classes until now.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Therefore, the story
of Nozomu and his team, who are also from the lowest class, defeating a higher
class is a very touching story for them, and at the same time, it is a source
of hope.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And although they were
from the 10th class, they were originally talented young individuals who had
come from across the continent.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Once the fetters on
their minds were removed, they would be able to work hard with greed and a
positive attitude.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, their
enthusiasm was even greater than one had expected, perhaps as a repercussion of
the considerable suppression they had been subjected to up until now.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the blink of an
eye, their initially sparse questions turned into a raging storm, and they
pounced on Nozomu.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"H-Hold on! I
don't know which one to answer first!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu's processing
capacity was finally overwhelmed by the sheer number of questions being thrown
at him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He was so overwhelmed
that he asked for help, but Jin, Deck, and Hamuria, who were teaming up with
him, were also getting bombarded with questions from their classmates.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Mars, lend me a
hand!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't be
unreasonable. I was away from the party at that time. So I don't know all the
details of the battle."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mars' face broke into
a grin as Nozomu asked for his help. Apparently, he was amused by Nozomu's
bewilderment.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu returned a
resentful glance to Mars, but even in the midst of this, the storm of questions
showed no sign of abating.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But it wasn't
unpleasant. It was certainly irritating to be teased by Mars, but there was no
malice in his classmates' eyes that were gathered around him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It might be temporary.
It might be gone later. In fact, the rest of his classmates who have not come
to listen to him are still looking at him with suspicion.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Still, for now, he
felt happy that his hard work in the Special Comprehensive Exercise had been
acknowledged.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Everyone~, good
morning~~. Let's do our best today as well~~!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that moment, the
classroom door was opened energetically. Anri-sensei entered the classroom.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Anri-sensei,
just in time!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Fue~?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Everyone, it was
Anri-sensei whom we were fighting against. She's a teacher after all, so she
can explain everything that happened to you in great detail!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The classmates who had
been crowded around Nozomu turned their gazes on Anri.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The greedy eyes of
those who had been rotting as failures until now were directed at the young
teacher.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"U-Umm~~.
Everyone~, what's the matter~~? Fuwa-wa-wa-wa!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Immediately afterward,
half of the classmates who had been crowded around Nozomu rushed toward Anri.
She was left struggling, completely unable to comprehend the situation. As a
result, questions did not cease even after the bell rang for the start of the
first period, and Anri's classes were delayed considerably.</span></span></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>‡</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After the morning
classes and lunch, Nozomu headed to the training ground with Mars, Jin, and the
others. He was already familiar with Jin and the others, not only because they
had worked together during the Special Comprehensive Exercise, but also because
of the incident in the classroom this morning.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, when Nozomu
and the others arrived at the training ground, they all tilted their heads in
puzzlement.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The instructor was not
in the training ground where the practical training class was scheduled to take
place, but instead a large sign was standing in his place.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmm, what's
this? A notice of change of location for the joint class?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Let's see......
the location is, Martial Arts Garden? Why there?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu and the others
tilted their heads when they saw the notice.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Martial Arts
Garden is the largest training facility at Solminati Academy. It is a huge oval
coliseum, with enough space in the central arena for all the students of one
grade to gather.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In addition, the arena
is surrounded by staircase-like spectator seating that can accommodate several
thousand spectators.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is because the
Martial Arts Garden was built as a place for students to showcase their martial
arts and magic demonstrations to guests not only from outside the school but
also from outside the city. Therefore, this facility is used only when the
academy makes a big campaign. It is not a facility that is normally used for
practical classes with other classes.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, all we can

nodded at Mars' words, and they all moved together to the Martial Arts Garden.
When they arrived, many students had already gathered. The number of students
gathered in the central arena was several hundred.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oi-oi, look, it

a Special Comprehensive Exercise, and they're already holding an event

not the only ones in the Martial Arts Garden. In the spectator's seats sat
first and second graders, who were juniors, and fourth graders, who were
seniors. The students of Ecross, an affiliated school, were also there. In
addition, there were about 30 people dressed in various, but extravagant,
outfits.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Why are there

little strange to have outsiders here. And judging by the way Anri-sensei is
behaving, it doesn't seem that way......."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu pointed to the
other side of the Martial Arts Garden, right across from the center, as he said
this to Deck and the others who were voicing their concerns. There, Anri, the
10th-class homeroom teacher, was waving her hand with a big smile on her face.
Beside her were Jihad, the school's principal, and Inda, his assistant.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Anri is a
student-oriented person who treats the lowest class, Nozomu and the others,
with kindness and equality. Looking at her, there is no sign of aversion or
avoidance toward this training.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(But sensei, can't you
do something about that conspicuous gesture? I'm attracting a lot of attention
here......)</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Anri has an outward
appearance that reminds one of a young lady with a deep peerage, but on the
other hand, her personality is strangely childlike.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When Nozomu grimaced
at her behavior, she began to jump up and down. Perhaps she wanted him to wave
back at her the same way she did.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her childishness
increased even more, and her long skirt fluttered up in the air.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is not good.
Nozomu had no choice but to go along with Anri and waved back. The eyes of the
whole Martial Arts Garden turned to Nozomu at once, as if they were looking at
something strange.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A-Ahahaha......."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While Nozomu's cheeks
twitched under the concentrated bombardment of stares, Anri looked satisfied
before returning to her business.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then a blue-haired
girl approached him.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You sure are

Martial Arts Garden with Mimuru, Tom, and Feo, spoke to Nozomu with a smile on
her face, but her expression seemed to be somewhat strained.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... You are
well-liked, huh?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Is that so? I
don't think that's the case-...... why are you glaring at me like that?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......

Nozomu thought about it, but he couldn't say anything about the accusatory
glances that were directed at him, and he broke out in a cold sweat. Then,
Mimru, who was standing next to Shina, opened her mouth while grinning.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't worry
about it~~. She's just worried about you, Nozomu~~."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmph!"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Immediately after,
Shina's iron claw unleashed on Mimuru. "Migyaa~!", a scream like a
flea being crushed resounded along with the sound of creaking bones.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey Nozomu, good

twitched at the tragedy in front of him, Irisdina and Tima who had arrived at
the Martial Arts Garden also called out to him. The girls chuckled at Shina and
Mimuru's comedic antics and took a glance at the people gathered in the spectator's
seats.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What a huge

joint classes for the entire school year is one thing, but inviting people from
outside the academy to demonstrate the classes is unusual at this time of the
year."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Soluminati Academy,
for the reason of its establishment, naturally has opportunities to showcase
its students and their abilities to the outside world. However, it is mainly
later in the annual year's curriculum. As far as Irisdina knows, there is no
such thing as a public exhibition of classes in the early spring.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Conversely, it could
be said that the students have more opportunities to show off their abilities.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While having such a
conversation, Nozomu's eyes naturally went to the place where the students of
the 1st-class were gathered and caught sight of the red-haired girl. Lisa also
noticed Nozomu, and as usual, she turned her angry gaze on him. The sight of
her unchanged behavior confirmed Nozomu's suspicions.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(Ken is the one who is
controlling Lisa, after all......)</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The one who is
actually controlling her is probably that lesser water spirit called Mefi. A
sense of resentment welled up from deep within his chest.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina, standing
next to him, looked at him with a complicated expression.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Everyone,

Irisdina, Shina, and the others as they lined up.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The school's
representatives, including Jihad, were lined up in front, and behind them in
the spectator's seats sat Ecross students and other dignitaries from outside
the school. The seats they sat in were exceptionally luxurious.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Ecross students
look interested and excited, but the dignitaries cast a somewhat judgmental
glance down at the students. A look that almost made one's spine itch. While
Nozomu uncomfortably winced, Jihad took a step forward.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Now, this joint

can expect to get quite a few extra points. Furthermore, it is possible to

Anri, Nozomu and the others were brought to the front of the main arena where
the 1st and 2nd classes were having a joint class. The other upper-class

10th class was here, intrigued and unreserved gazes were directed at Nozomu's
back.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu has been
exposed to a great deal of ill will in the past, but he has never been

Somia and Mena among the spectators.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When Nozomu's eyes met

on even against the offensive of the 1st class students. The experience of
fighting and winning against Anri, who was much more powerful during the
Special Comprehensive Exercise. This allowed them to regain the confidence and
strength that they had previously lost.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oi-oi, look at

of those around them began to gather on Jin, Mars, and the others. Nozomu found
himself clenching his fists in support of their hard-fought battle.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Excuse me, do

hoarse voice. His attention, which had been focused on Jin and the others, was
pulled back to his side.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was a neat-looking
old man. He had brown skin, almost gray hair, and only a few black hairs
remaining. He was wearing a blackish-brown robe that was recognizable as a
high-quality garment, with the emblem of the Gloaurum Institution embroidered
on the robe.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His eyes were large in
contrast to his long face. The light in his eyes, which peek out through
hollowed pupils, is strong and gives the impression that he is more vigorous
than his age.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In his hand is a
simple brown cane. Judging by its luster, it is probably made of gemstone. It
was worn and knobby, perhaps from age.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I don't mind,

influential figure in the city. Nozomu involuntarily gulped at the strong and
curious, yet insect-like inorganic eyes that fixed on him.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, apologies.

upon hearing that name. He knew the name.

person in Arcazam. He is a major figure who compiled the indigenous magic of
each region and created Arcazam's chanting and formation formulas. The rapid
development of this city cannot be described without him.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He is a key figure who
is usually holed up in the laboratory of the Gloaurum Institution and never
appears in public. What would such a person be doing here, away from the
distinguished guests' seats?</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Naturally, the eyes of
the surrounding people began to focus on the old man.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmm, I see that

closely, one would see that the guards in the distinguished guests' seats were
pointing in this direction and rushing out in a panic. Shortly after this, they
would surely barge into this waiting area.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmmm, looks like

hand, did not seem to feel any particular emotion, but merely glanced in the
direction of the distinguished guests' seats and immediately returned his
gawking gaze to Nozomu.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, even if

descended from the arena in the Martial Arts Garden, and in their place, Jihad,
a burly man in silver and white armor, ascended to the center of the arena.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What

single-edged sword, even larger and thicker than Mars' great sword. Considering
its weight, it would be impossible for an ordinary human to even lift it.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Giant Sword</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">・</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Jaw Drop.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is Jihad Raundel's

was originally designed to be used against powerful demonic beasts and is
therefore not something that can be easily handled.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But he brought

head of the Solminati Academy, and he became famous for his heroic exploits
during the Great Invasion 20 years ago and the subsequent Operation Fructus.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At the time of the
invasion, he was a knight belonging to a small country on the eastern side of
the continent.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The country was
overrun by demonic beasts and collapsed. Nevertheless, he managed to protect
the remaining people while they were defeated.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Later, in Operation
Fructus, a major counterinsurgency operation conducted with the cooperation of
many countries, he liberated the area from the Delta Zone to the southwestern
part of the Central Mountain Range. He then became the commander of the third
unit of the [Silver Rainbow Knight Order], a group of knights created by
assembling the elite of each country, and continuously spearheaded the defeat
of the demonic beasts that remained in the human sphere.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The most famous battle
of his career is the fierce battle against one of the [The Six Bad Omens],
[Wisdom Dragon of the Rigid Waves]. While the third unit of the Silver Rainbow
Knights, which he was commanding at the time, was destroyed, he fought the
demonic beast and cut off its lower jaw.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As a result, the beast
lost most of its fighting ability and was defeated. Since then, it is said that
the beast has never appeared in public again.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Because of this
anecdote, his sword came to be known as the [Jaw Drop].</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What kind of student

Irisdina and the other 1st class students were not even called.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"U-Umm,

thrust the [Jaw Drop] he was carrying into the ground with a meaningful smile

the distinguished guests' seats where Mena was sitting. The skilled maid was
still standing by Somia's side, looking as nonchalant as ever.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To Nozomu's surprise,
Jihad began to wrap his body with Qi.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Qi was so dense
that it shook the air. Nozomu's eyes squinted at the chill running down his
spine.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His heartbeat
quickened, and his body naturally shifted into a state of combat. Seeing Nozomu
who was shaken but not intimidated, the hero smiled and gestured to Inda, who
was by the side of the arena.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Inda nodded to Jihad's
gaze and held up her right hand. Then a section of the stone floor rose up to
the height of her waist. As she imbued her fingers with magic and ran them over
the pedestal, a four-layered wall of light appeared to cover the arena. This is
a special mechanism installed in this Martial Arts Garden to protect the
spectators and waiting seats, and it is a ritual magic that deploys four magic
barriers that can block even advance-tiered magic.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Furthermore, the hard
stone floor of the arena began to crumble. The collapsed stone floor became
moist soil, and stone spires rose one after another from the soil. Their
appearance and hue changed to that of trees rooted in the ground.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This

changed drastically. It was the same scenery as in the spasim forest that he
knew so well.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Another feature of
this Martial Arts Garden is to recreate a wide variety of environments through
ritual magic.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Naturally, it is
possible to recreate not only forests, but also watery areas, deserts, and

the roots of a tree running into the soil beneath his feet.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The hard, cold feel of
stone felt on his fingers. It was an elaborate pseudo-tree, so elaborate that
it was hard to believe that it actually was a transformed stone floor.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This is a

gasped at Jihad's meaningful words.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(Jihad-sensei

intense temptation. The release of ability suppression and the use of the
source element of the Dragon King. If he were to use the powers he displayed in
his previous battle against one of the Six Bad Omens, [Cracked-Crown] Giant
Centipede, that alone would be enough to change the rumors that had circulated
about him.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But at the same time,
it would drastically increase the chances of Nozomu being known as the Dragon

could subside, Jihad closed in on Nozomu. He swung his great sword, which was
originally supposed to be used as a two-handed sword, effortlessly with one
hand and struck a powerful blow that seemed to split the wind.</span></span></p>
