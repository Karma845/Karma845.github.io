<h3>Epilogue</h3>


<p>That day… It’s been a few days since the interaction with Hatsune-san and the others. Nothing particularly changed, and it’s been peaceful days without anything good or bad happening. </p>



<p>I was wary, expecting some action from their side, but maybe Ayana’s clear words had an effect.</p>



<p>“Things seem quiet on that end too… But what about over there?”</p>



<p>“Over there” refers to the man at the sports gym. I went to the gym for a day to observe him a bit more, but the female trainer who was with me then told me that the man had already quit.</p>



<p>“He suddenly called and said he’s quitting. As adults, his way of quitting seemed odd, but he seemed desperate… Anyway, he’s no longer here. To us women, he was a jerk who harassed us… Ahem, but now that he’s gone, we’re relieved.”</p>



<p>It seems that the man was disliked for being a habitual sexual harasser… I can’t help but wonder why they hired such a person, but maybe he had some strange influence, though that’s just a wild guess.</p>



<p>“…I don’t get it.”</p>



<p>I somehow felt it might be better not to pursue this. I can’t completely let my guard down, but I can honestly feel relieved about that man for now.</p>




<p>Lost in thought, my feet stopped, and I hurried towards my destination with a brisk pace.</p>



<p>“…Phew, it’s getting a little hot after all.”</p>



<p>By the time I reached my destination─ Ayana’s house, I had sweated a bit on my back. It’s not summer yet, but it’s definitely approaching. The temperature is gradually changing to the typical summer heat… It’s still cool, though.</p>



<p>As I rang the intercom at the entrance, the one who greeted me was Seina-san.</p>



<p>“Welcome, Towa-kun… Ara, are you sweating a bit?”</p>



<p>“Good morning, Seina-san. Yeah… I ran a bit.”</p>



<p>“I see… Does that mean you wanted to see me that much?”</p>



<p>It’s not entirely wrong, so I didn’t deny it.</p>



<p>“Where’s Ayana?”</p>




<p>“Ah… She’s in her room. Just go straight in.”</p>



<p>“? Got it.”</p>



<p>What’s going on…? While muttering that it’s too early, I tilted my head at Seina-san, who was holding her head, and went inside.</p>



<p>“Ah, right.”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“…Has anything been said since then?”</p>



<p>“Anything … ah, something like that. We had a chance to talk for a while — although I did get a little glare from them when I told her what I thought.”</p>



<p>“………………”</p>



<p>I wondered if something was said, and of course, this refers to Hatsune-san and the others.</p>




<p>It seems from Seina-san’s story that it was just being glared at and nothing more, but there was still a sense of apology.</p>



<p>“Don’t make that face. In fact, I find it more convenient to be on this side.”</p>



<p>“……………”</p>



<p>“If you and Ayana look happy, then that’s all that matters. Come on, go see her quickly.”</p>



<p>“……Understood.”</p>



<p>…Yeah, I should just rely on Seina-san’s thoughtfulness here.</p>



<p>The next destination, of course, was Ayana’s room… However, Ayana, who would usually be the first to greet me, didn’t come out today… I wonder if there’s a reason for this?</p>



<p>After pondering silently for a few seconds without coming to any conclusions, I simply knocked on the door.</p>



<p>“Ayana?”</p>




<p>“Oh, Towa-kun, come in. It’s okay to come in.”</p>



<p>As I entered, I was greeted by a surprising sight.</p>



<p> “…Eh?”</p>



<p> “Fufu♪”</p>



<p>Ayana smiled softly, but… she was in her underwear.</p>



<p>Regardless of when she took it off, her regular clothes, which she would have been wearing, were discarded on the bed, and the only fabric she had on was clearly flashy black lingerie for a high school student… What is she doing!?</p>



<p>“What are you doing?”</p>



<p>“It’s not like I’ve suddenly developed an exhibitionist streak or anything? I just had something I wanted to try out in anticipation of the upcoming summer.”</p>



<p>“Summer…?”</p>




<p>Having something she wanted to try out in anticipation of summer?</p>



<p>Even though it’s not even June yet… Well, as I thought about it, I quickly understood what Ayana wanted to do.</p>



<p>The item Ayana held in her hand was a pure white bikini.</p>



<p>“It’s not that I’m trying to jump the gun on summer, but I’d like Towa-kun to judge whether the same swimsuit I wore last year still suits me this year.”</p>



<p>“…I see.”</p>



<p>I finally understood the meaning behind Seina-san’s premature actions.</p>



<p>Certainly… I’ll admit it’s premature, but as a man who can see this sight, it’s like a reward, and moreover, as someone who loves Ayana, I can’t help but want to see her.</p>



<p>“Well then, let’s make the judgment.”</p>



<p>If that’s the case, then I’ll confidently make the judgment. I plopped down on the spot, still staring at Ayana in her underwear… </p>




<p>Well, it goes without saying that seeing her in her current naughty and thrilling state is exciting, but I’ve become somewhat accustomed to seeing her naked… I have grown.</p>



<p>“Shall we start with the top just to be safe?”</p>



<p>Ayana puts her hands behind her back and unhooks it with a snap.</p>



<p>At that moment, the power that had been supporting Ayana’s voluptuous bre*sts was lost, and they began to sway and reveal…Suppressing the urge to shout “Oooooh!” in my mind, I reminded myself that I was here as the judge of swimsuits.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/image-12.jpg"/>

<p>“…………”</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s nothing… I just realized that being stared at by Towa-kun while being naked still makes me feel nervous.”</p>



<p>“If that’s the case—”</p>



<p>“But I don’t want you to look away either, so please just keep looking♪”</p>




<p>Seems like that’s the case, so I was forbidden from averting my gaze from her. As I followed Ayana’s movements with my eyes, my gaze wandered around her figure. However, a problem arose immediately.</p>



<p>“Hmm… is it small?”</p>



<p>Ayana tilted her head in confusion, drawing my attention. It seems that the swimsuit she was trying to put on was a bit small for her ch*st size.</p>



<p>“It’s not so small that I can’t put it on… but hmm, considering I also bought a larger bra size than last year, maybe it’s time to upgrade this one too.”</p>



<p>As Ayana said that, she looked at me with a sly grin. Her enchanting expression sent my heart racing more than it had all day, but all I could do was wait for her words.</p>



<p>What… what is she going to say?</p>



<p>Ayana removed the ill-fitting swimsuit, lifting up her ample ch*st as she continued.</p>



<p>“Being loved by someone you love from the bottom of your heart, and being adored here too, it’s only natural that they grow bigger, right?… So, the fact that my bre*sts have grown bigger is the best proof that Towa-kun loves me with all his heart♪”</p>



<p>“………Guooooooo!”</p>




<p>What are these words that are both er*tic and yet purely heartwarming!</p>



<p>“Ufufu♪…how do you like it, Towa-kun, am I …… naughty?”</p>


<p>Should I say that asking about such an obvious thing is the right answer? </p>



<p>Or is it more appropriate to say that not to strike while the iron is hot would be shameful for a man, and to instinctively dive into Ayana’s ch*st is the right answer? I cleared my throat to calm myself down and looked back at her.</p>



<p>(No, no, it’s not appropriate to gaze back at her in this situation, is it…?)</p>



<p>But averting my gaze would be awkward… Hmm.</p>



<p>Just like how I don’t feel embarrassed looking at her naked, Ayana doesn’t seem to feel embarrassed being seen naked by me either… Or rather, with the way she’s tempting me like this, it’s not embarrassing enough for her to feel shy about it.</p>



<p>“Well… it’s er*tic. I don’t usually say it, but it’s like saying it all the time when I’m with you, Ayana.”</p>



<p>“Every time I hear you say that, it makes me happy. Many people tend to avoid such topics, and I have no reason to bring it up… But I love talking about these things with you, Towa-kun. Being thought of as erotic by you, it makes me realize how much charm I have as a woman.”</p>




<p>“Yeah… it’s er*tic.”</p>



<p>“Yes♪ Thank you♪”</p>



<p>Ayana, oozing with cuteness and eroticism, approached me and hugged me as if she had forgotten our original purpose.</p>



<p>The soft sensation of her breasts pressed against my chest, transmitted directly without the barrier of clothes or underwear.</p>



<p>“Ayana?”</p>



<p>Normally, I would have gone along with the atmosphere, but Ayana just stared at me without making any move to do something… In fact, her eyes seemed to be enjoying the current situation to the fullest.</p>



<p>“I felt a little… sentimental just now.”</p>



<p>“Sentimental?”</p>



<p>“Yes. Right now, I’m just so happy… but if I had made one wrong step, I might not have been able to interact with you so openly and honestly.”</p>




<p>That could have certainly happened.</p>



<p>Even though my approach to her might not have changed, Ayana would have gradually accumulated hatred in preparation for that moment… It’s just that not having that makes her wear such a genuine expression, which is really good.</p>



<p>“But, Ayana.”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>“If you get moved by every little thing like this, you won’t be able to handle it, you know?”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“Because from now on, we’re going to be even happier.”</p>



<p>“…Ah.”</p>



<p>Yes, from now on, we’re going to be even happier.</p>




<p>Not just one of us, but both of us together, to the utmost happiness… That’s why I said that if she got moved by every little thing now, she wouldn’t be able to handle it.</p>



<p>Ayana’s eyes widened for a moment, but then she smiled and gave me a gentle kiss.</p>



<p>“Chu….”</p>



<p>I responded to the kiss, and after enjoying a sweet moment together, we parted.</p>



<p>As we continued to gaze at each other, Ayana remained naked as usual… Suddenly, Ayana stood up.</p>



<p>“I… I’ll put my clothes on.”</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah…”</p>



<p>After quickly putting on her clothes, Ayana sat down next to me.</p>



<p>Feeling her snuggle up against me, embracing my arm against her ch*st, I allowed my thoughts to wander in this blissful space.</p>




<p>(Just leisurely savoring this happiness feels like déjà vu… Wasn’t it like this the day I talked with Ayana and went home?)</p>



<p>As for my state of mind, it’s exactly the same as it was then… But what’s decisively different is that I have far more peace of mind now than I did back then.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“We… are going to keep living together, right? It’s not just about resolving one or two problems and then calling it quits; it’s about continuing to walk together beyond that, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>“For many years to come, decades even.”</p>



<p>I nodded.</p>



<p>These past few weeks, which have been so intense, have brought many things to us.</p>




<p>While there are still problems remaining, the recent events have been overwhelmingly positive for both Ayana and me… It goes without saying that we’ve obtained the guiding light leading to a undoubtedly brighter future.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun?”</p>



<p>“…We’ll always be together.”</p>



<p>“…Fufu, yes♪”</p>



<p>My resolve to protect this child who laughs by my side remains unchanged.</p>



<p>Even if, hypothetically, all our problems were resolved now, it would be too sad if it turned out to be just a dream… But even so, I wouldn’t mind as long as this child is happy.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, that’s not okay, you know?”</p>



<p>“…Eh?”</p>



<p>Ayana’s words caught me off guard.</p>




<p>What’s not okay? As I pondered this question, she explained it to me.</p>



<p>“I said I understand you to some extent, right? So, when you had that distant look in your eyes… It looked like you were thinking it would be okay as long as I’m happy, even if you’re not here.”</p>



<p>“…You really understood that?”</p>



<p>“…Of course.”</p>



<p>…She’s onto me.</p>



<p>Honestly, knowing Ayana, it wouldn’t be surprising if she saw through everything, so I stupidly reacted honestly.</p>



<p>With her cheeks puffed out, Ayana leaned in closer, almost as if she were cornering me.</p>



<p>“Are the words ‘we’ll be happy together’ a lie? If you were gone, I could never be happy… You understand that, right?”</p>



<p>“…Sorry, Ayana.”</p>




<p>“I forgive you.”</p>



<p>Jeez… That’s right… That’s how it is.</p>



<p>We vowed to be happy together… So no matter what irreversible events occur, it won’t work if one of us is missing.</p>



<p>Even though it was my idea to bring it up, I still got called out by Ayana for it.</p>



<p>“Even if you were gone, I will find you. I’d search for you even at the ends of the earth and bring you back.”</p>



<p>“Geez, that’s heavy…”</p>



<p>“But you love that about me, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I love you.”</p>



<p>“I love you too♪”</p>




<p>And so, we embraced each other again.</p>



<p>Feeling happy when Ayana is by my side is a given, but feeling happy because the surrounding environment has also moved in a positive direction makes it all the more special.</p>



<p>“In the end… I didn’t get to showcase the swimsuit, right? I definitely have to go buy a new one before summer.”</p>



<p>“Am I going along with you?”</p>



<p>“Of course. Please share your opinion, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>I nodded firmly.</p>



<p>Well, as I mentioned earlier, I’ll continue living in this world forever… So inevitably, I’ll experience many events with Ayana. </p>



<p>This world is like a second home to me, but… I wonder if there will come a day when Ayana’s world becomes the best and most important world for me… Well, I guess that day will come soon, too, I laughed.</p>



<p>“Oh, by the way, Towa-kun, did you hear? Akemi-san is also coming over tonight.”</p>




<p>“Eh? Seriously?”</p>



<p>“Oh, you didn’t know, huh? Well, she’s coming to drink a lot of alcohol again, so let’s go through the hardships together, shall we?”</p>



<p>“I don’t wanna do thaaaaaaaaaat!”</p>



<p>“Ahaha♪ But it’s fun and lively, I’m really happy about it!”</p>



<p>Oh, the polite language disappeared… No, I mean, I have to deal with the two of them drunk again!?</p>



<p>What grudge does God have against me… Beside Ayana, who was smiling, I sighed heavily as I thought about the approaching night.</p>



<p>Well, but… Somehow, I seem to be looking forward to it too.</p>



<p>Ayana’s smile reflected in the large mirror was, of course, beautiful, and sitting next to her, I was also smiling.</p>
