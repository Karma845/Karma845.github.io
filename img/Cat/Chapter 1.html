<h3>Chapter 1</h3>


<p>“I’m going to the restroom for a moment.”</p>



<p>Ayana said in the morning, heading towards the bathroom.</p>



<p>Today was a weekday, so there was school as usual, but I was already getting used to seeing Ayana’s presence at home, which she normally wouldn’t have.</p>



<p>“Ayana-chan does all the housework… I wonder if I even have a purpose here anymore.”</p>



<p>“Ahaha….”</p>



<p>Mom sighed, seemingly having lost her role. Of course, she was just exaggerating, and she continued with a laugh.</p>



<p>“You really chose a good girl as your girlfriend, huh?”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>




<p>“Ara, you immediately nodded at that, Towa.”</p>



<p>While saying “This, this!” Mom lightly nudged me.</p>



<p>Ayana being a good girl and the best girlfriend is natural… right? So there’s no need for me to try to justify it awkwardly. I just nodded honestly.</p>



<p>“What are you doing today, Mom?”</p>



<p>“Hmm… Even though it’s a weekday, it’s my day off, so I’ll just relax.”</p>



<p>“When you have time to rest, make sure to rest properly. I wouldn’t want anything to happen to my beloved mom.”</p>



<p>“…Towaaaaaa!!”</p>



<p>“Kofuu!?”</p>



<p>With the force of a missile, Mom thrust her stomach into mine.</p>




<p>Despite feeling like the breakfast I just ate was about to come back up from the shock, I endured it with all my might, not wanting to turn this into a tragic accident scene.</p>



<p>“Geez, Mom… that was quite sudden.”</p>



<p>“But I am so happy!”</p>



<p>Mom, who laughed brightly, was cute… well, not really. But I couldn’t help but think that it was a bit much for her to suddenly jump into me with such momentum.</p>



<p>“How about this then?”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>As soon as she separated from me, Mom gently hugged my head.</p>



<p>Since it was her chest I was invited into, I felt a happy sensation against my cheek, but since she’s my flesh and blood, I didn’t feel any fluttering in my heart.</p>



<p>“Fufu, you really are adorable, Towa♪”</p>




<p>When I glanced up, Mom was smiling happily at me.</p>



<p>Beautiful as the dawn—she was my mother, and for me, who had almost completely assimilated with Towa’s soul, there was no discomfort in calling her that.</p>



<p>(…Geez, this depth of affection is starting to become addictive.)</p>



<p>Mom’s affection was a bit heavy… I’ve been feeling that more strongly lately.</p>



<p>Perhaps one reason she pours so much love onto me is because I’m the only family she has left after losing Dad.</p>



<p>“Towa.”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“It’s about Ayana-chan.”</p>



<p>Turning serious from her previous demeanor, Mom continued.</p>




<p>“I’m really happy that Ayana-chan has officially started dating you. I knew Towa was serious about her, and above all, I like her too.”</p>



<p>“I can tell that Mom really likes Ayana.”</p>



<p>I said, and Mom chuckled.</p>



<p>I had a feeling I knew what she was going to say next, but I wanted to hear Mom’s opinion, so I listened without interrupting.</p>



<p>“Of course, being by Towa’s side is the most important thing, but that girl also says she wants to be with me… She really is a sinful girl in a sense.”</p>



<p>“A sinful girl… Haha, yeah, maybe she is.”</p>



<p>“I know, right? While it’s nice to hear her say that, I also feel like it’s not enough the way things are now.”</p>



<p>“…Yeah.”</p>



<p>That’s right, things can’t stay like this. I’ve been subtly asking about Seina, Ayana’s mother, but thankfully, it doesn’t seem like repairing our relationship is impossible.</p>




<p>Although there was quite an intense exchange when we met in town before, Ayana’s decision to look forward and walk alongside me has significantly reduced the animosity she harbored.</p>



<p>[Except for my mother…. I’m not sure about Kotone-chan and Hatsune-san. I think I can interact with them calmly, but if they say something that crosses the line, I’ll explode!]</p>



<p>By the way, I don’t think it was a hallucination when Ayana said she was going to explode and I saw a demon behind her.</p>



<p>As I can tell from this statement, it might be wishful thinking, but I feel like I could somehow make things work with Seina-san if there’s a chance.</p>



<p>“Hey, Mom.”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>Ah, she’s so kind… No, that’s not it!</p>



<p>Stepping away from Mom for a moment, I decided to respond to what Mom had said by sharing my own thoughts.</p>



<p>“I want to assure you about Ayana. But it’s quite deep-rooted, so I can’t guarantee anything will change… But I want you to trust Ayana.”</p>




<p>That’s all I can say for now. It would be cool if I could tell Mom not to worry because I can handle everything, but…</p>



<p>Mom widened her eyes for a moment, then nodded immediately.</p>



<p>“I understand. There’s no one who can compare to Ayana-chan when it comes to being by Towa’s side.”</p>



<p>That’s a given!</p>



<p>I nodded vigorously, and Mom looked at me with a tender smile, gently patting my head as if I were a young child.</p>



<p>Even though I’m already in high school, Mom probably can’t help but find me irresistibly cute… Every time I think about it, I realize how important family is, no matter what.</p>



<p>“I said leave it to me, but I want Mom to help me if something happens.”</p>



<p>“Got it. Always count on me, okay? Well, I’m also thinking that if there’s an opportunity, I’ll talk to Ayana-chan’s mom with my arm around her!”</p>



<p>“…Mom, that seems too easy for you.”</p>




<p>It might be my imagination, but I can easily imagine Mom teasing a bewildered Seina-san, with her arm around her shoulders. It’s about 120% likely to happen, and it’s actually kind of amusing in reverse.</p>



<p>“Of course I can’t forgive what happened in the past. But since you, my son, are looking ahead with a bright face, I can’t be stuck in the past forever, right?”</p>



<p>“…Mom, you’re strong.”</p>



<p>“Of course. A mother is strong.”</p>



<p>…Yeah. That’s absolutely true.</p>



<p>“I’m back… Ah, what a precious moment.”</p>



<p>“Ara, welcome back, Ayana-chan.”</p>



<p>“Welcome back, Ayana.”</p>



<p>A precious moment… Well, I won’t deny it.</p>




<p>After Ayana returned and I left Mom, we prepared to head to school.</p>



<p>“I’m off.”</p>



<p>“See you later, Akemi-san.”</p>



<p>“Take care, both of you.”</p>



<p>A little further from home, Ayana reached out her hand, and I took it.</p>



<p>At first, our hands were just linked normally, but soon we intertwined fingers, like lovers.</p>



<p>“…Fufu♪”</p>



<p>Ayana’s smile was infectious, and I couldn’t help but relax my cheeks too.</p>



<p>“Ah, Towa-kun.”</p>




<p>“What’s up?”</p>



<p>“Lately… I’ve been relying on you too much. I think I’ll go back home today.”</p>



<p>“…Ah, I see.”</p>



<p>I was slightly surprised by Ayana’s sudden words.</p>



<p>However, it wasn’t strange for Ayana to say that, and I actually felt a bit relieved since I had been wondering if things should stay the same… But I also felt a bit lonely.</p>



<p>“From your expression, I can tell you’ll miss me, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah… Well, sort of. It’s not unusual for you to go back home, but… I guess I’ve gotten used to having you around all the time.”</p>



<p>Even if that wasn’t the case, I would feel lonely whenever Ayana wasn’t there.</p>



<p>I might seem weak, but that just shows how important Ayana is to me.</p>




<p>“Even though it hasn’t been that many days, is there a reason you suddenly decided to leave?”</p>



<p>“Yes. Actually, I overheard your conversation earlier…”</p>



<p>Ah… I see.</p>



<p>Ayana apologized for eavesdropping, but I felt sorry for making her feel that way.</p>



<p>“Don’t look like that. I just wanted to avoid the awkwardness by running to your place whenever things got tense between me and my mother, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“…Ayana, I…”</p>



<p>“Of course, I’ll talk to my mother first as I should, but if I need help, I’ll definitely ask you.”</p>



<p>“Of course. If you need anything, just call me, and I’ll come running.”</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>




<p>That’s not a lie. No matter what happens, I’ll be there for her.</p>



<p>Ayana nodded happily at my words and squeezed my hand even tighter.</p>



<p>“Hey, Ayana?”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>“People are starting to gather around us…”</p>



<p>“Oh, are you worried about that?”</p>



<p>Saying so, Ayana gave me a teasing look.</p>



<p>Since we’re walking to school, the closer we get, the more students there are… Meaning, although not overtly, people will start paying attention to us as we walk hand in hand.</p>



<p>(It’s like you’re saying, ‘If I let go because it’s embarrassing, that’s admitting defeat, right?’ Well, bring it on, Ayana.)</p>




<p>Honestly, I’m amazed at my own competitiveness and inwardly chuckle at myself.</p>



<p>I squeeze her hand even tighter, showing my determination not to let go, even though I never planned to in the first place. I grasp her hand firmly, enough to show I won’t lose to Ayana… but not enough to cause her pain.</p>



<p>“You’re quite competitive, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Coming from you?”</p>



<p>“I guess I can’t say anything.”</p>



<p>“That’s right.”</p>



<p>“Indeed.”</p>



<p>We laughed together and continued walking to school.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“After only a few days, you two are already lovey-dovey, huh?”</p>




<p>Upon entering the classroom and parting ways with Ayana, my friend Aisaka immediately approached me with a teasing remark.</p>



<p>“Good morning, Aisaka. Well, we’ve just started dating, so it’s natural, you know?”</p>



<p>We’re still in the honeymoon phase, so being lovey-dovey is to be expected for a fresh couple like us. But… the moment I heard the term “honeymoon phase,” I couldn’t help but imagine our relationship turning cold. It put me in a slightly blue mood… Ridiculous! It’s impossible for our relationship to cool down!</p>



<p>When I shook my head fervently to dispel such thoughts, Aisaka became concerned and asked me what was wrong.</p>



<p>“What’s with the sudden change?”</p>



<p>“Ah… I was just thinking about what would happen if Ayana and I hit a rough patch.”</p>



<p>“If you and Ayana hit a rough patch?”</p>



<p>Aisaka borrowed a chair from the front row and sat down with a thud, then opened his mouth to speak.</p>



<p>“I’d be really curious to see if you and Ayana ever hit a rough patch. Ah, it’s not because I think it’ll happen, it’s just my curiosity. If that did happen, it would be the end of the world, right?”</p>




<p>“Are you serious?”</p>



<p>“Absolutely. Based on what I see of you two normally, it’s inconceivable.”</p>



<p>From Aisaka’s perspective, such a thing would be unthinkable, and he nodded in agreement.</p>



<p>I see… I never asked others how they perceived our relationship, but if it’s seen this way, it’s an honor.</p>



<p>“… O”</p>



<p>“What’s up?”</p>



<p>Mid-conversation, Aisaka suddenly whispered and looked in a particular direction.</p>



<p>Wondering what was going on, I followed his gaze and saw Shu… he had just arrived at school and was heading straight to his desk.</p>



<p>Once seated, he slumped over his desk and remained motionless, completely shutting himself off from his surroundings.</p>




<p>“That guy must have been in a lot of shock…hasn’t it been a long time coming?”</p>



<p>“…Yeah”</p>



<p>It’s somewhat known that Ayana and I started dating.</p>



<p>We didn’t announce it ourselves, but our relationship became more apparent to friends like Aisaka, who noticed the increased intimacy between us. This inevitably led them to realize Shu had experienced heartbreak – hence the cause of his current state.</p>



<p>After observing Shu for a while, Aisaka spoke as if to reassure me.</p>



<p>“Well, it’s natural to be concerned since we’re somewhat acquainted, but it’s just how it goes. Heartbreak is a part of love, after all.”</p>



<p>“Haha… it’s funny to hear you worrying about me like this.”</p>



<p>“I’m your friend, so of course I’m concerned. I don’t think it’s necessary, but don’t hold back because of Otonashi-san, okay?”</p>



<p>“As if I’d let it affect our relationship that much. If anything, Ayana would scold me for doing so.”</p>




<p>Despite the ups and downs with Shu, I’ve never hated him.</p>



<p>I hope that as the relationship between Ayana and I progresses, we can somehow move it in a better direction…because he’s also a childhood friend of Ayana.</p>



<p>“I know that Shu liked Ayana… but I confessed my feelings to Ayana knowing that. I don’t regret it, and I don’t think this choice is wrong.”</p>



<p>“I see… Well, I’m not worried about anything!”</p>



<p>Saying so, Aisaka pats my back vigorously.</p>



<p>Feeling a bit sore from the patting, I stop him and ask him about his situation.</p>



<p>“What about you? Remember when you got all red-faced when you talked about someone you liked and mentioned a junior?”</p>



<p>“…..W-Well, it’s none of your business!”</p>



<p>Aisaka says so and promptly runs away.</p>




<p>His reaction was so obvious that I felt like I had found a toy to play with, but I wonder who the junior Aisaka is interested in… Hmm, I’d like to find out someday.</p>



<p>“Haa…”</p>



<p>As Aisaka runs away, I start thinking again.</p>



<p>Now that Ayana’s worries have been somewhat resolved, she not only smiles more in private but also receives letters quite frequently at school, despite having a boyfriend like me.</p>



<p>“It’s troublesome. Even if I receive letters, I won’t respond… and even if they come to see me directly, it’s the same… haa, it’s annoying.”</p>



<p>Ayana’s inner dark side comes out a little when she’s annoyed like this.</p>



<p>It’s not just someone aiming for Ayana; there are also girls who feel jealous of popular Ayana… Nevertheless, Ayana, who has been freed from her burden, unconsciously exudes more charm than ever.</p>



<p>(… And then there’s Shu.)</p>



<p>The next person I glance at is Shu, who is still lying face down as usual.</p>




<p>As Aisaka mentioned, Shu has been spending his time like that lately, and even close friends other than Ayana and me don’t seem to talk to him much.</p>



<p>However, I’ve seen him talking to Iori, who often comes to call him, and Mari, who actively approaches him when they meet, so that’s a bit reassuring.</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>Just as I start feeling that the teacher will arrive soon and the morning assembly will begin, I feel a sharp gaze… from Shu.</p>



<p>He lifts his face slightly and looks at me for a moment, but as soon as our eyes meet, he quickly averts his gaze and buries his face again.</p>



<p>“Yare yare… (Good grief)”</p>



<p>Despite everything, it’s quite troublesome for a relationship that used to be so normal and playful to become strained… Naturally, I let out a sigh.</p>



<p>But despite feeling this way, time passed as usual.</p>



<p>After having lunch with Ayana during lunch break, I had the opportunity to meet with them.</p>




<p>“Ara, Yukishiro-kun.”</p>



<p>“Ah, Yukishiro-senpai!”</p>



<p>Iori Honjo and Mari Uchida … they were the heroines who met Shu through Ayana, but escaped from a cruel fate now that Ayana’s darkness has cleared.</p>



<p>(… I wonder if it’ll be okay?)</p>



<p>Even though Ayana has no intention of scheming anymore, it’s natural to feel anxious knowing what she was like in the game.</p>



<p>“Hello, Honjo-Senpai, and also Mari.”</p>



<p>The memories that only I know about are no longer relevant to them, so I approached them without showing any concern for the two.</p>



<p>“What are you two doing?”</p>



<p>“I met Uchida-san on my way back from the faculty room and had a little chat.”</p>




<p>“Yes! I happened to see Honjo-Senpai!”</p>



<p>It seems like the two of them met by chance.</p>



<p>Ayana, with a troubled expression, telling them not to speak so loudly, and Marie, apologizing with a bright smile.</p>



<p>“What about you, Yukishiro-kun?”</p>



<p>“I was just wandering around aimlessly.”</p>



<p>“And you happened to come down to the first floor like that?”</p>



<p>“Well…”</p>



<p>Being pointed out like that makes me a little embarrassed… but it’s actually true.</p>



<p>As I struggle to respond, the two of them look at me curiously, but Ayana comes up with something amusing and smiles mischievously, then approaches me.</p>




<p>My gaze is drawn to her long, beautiful black hair, but I can’t divert my eyes from her sharp yet gentle gaze… Ayana is indeed beautiful.</p>



<p>“Lately, you’ve been a little too lovey-dovey with Otonashi-san, haven’t you?”</p>



<p>“Eh… is that how it seems?”</p>



<p>To have my current state described like that… but maybe it’s not entirely wrong?</p>



<p>I want to believe that I’m not much different from how I used to be… but sometimes when I’m alone, I can’t help but grin.</p>



<p>“When I saw Yukishiro-senpai and Ayana-senpai, they seemed really lovey-dovey! Even my friends say they want to date a boy like that!”</p>



<p>As if delivering the final blow, Mari says something like that.</p>



<p>Unlike Ayana, who makes teasing remarks without any malicious intent, it’s embarrassing to be teased like this by Mari, who has pure, straightforward eyes.</p>



<p>“Ah, I should go back soon! Well then, see you next time, both of you!”</p>




<p>“O-Ou…”</p>



<p>“Thank you, Uchida-san.”</p>



<p>Waving her hand vigorously, Mari runs off… and she’s being scolded by the teacher for running.</p>



<p>“That girl… despite her appearance, she’s quite flustered and lacks composure.”</p>



<p>“You mean she’s childish?”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>“You’re quite sure about that.”</p>



<p>“Well, isn’t it obvious?”</p>



<p>Chuckling, Iori says so.</p>




<p>Well… even though I came here because of the situation, I didn’t expect to be alone with Iori like this.</p>



<p>It’s not like I’m keeping Ayana waiting, and we still have plenty of time… actually, Ayana doesn’t seem to show any signs of leaving early.</p>



<p>“Do you want to run away?”</p>



<p>“Wha–!?”</p>



<p>“Is that a joke? Or did you blurt it out because you were caught off guard?”</p>



<p>Uhm… well, it’s both, I guess. Yes.</p>



<p>I didn’t expect to blurt it out like that, but I was surprised that Iori could guess what I was thinking.</p>



<p>“It takes courage to want to run away in front of me.”</p>



<p>“…Are you a queen or something?”</p>




<p>If she had a whip, she’d probably confidently crack it without hesitation… and Iori seems like she’d be suited for it because she has a sadistic side.</p>



<p>Although Iori maintains her stance of teasing the me, she exhales as if to change the atmosphere.</p>



<p>“Yukishiro-kun. Can we talk for a bit?”</p>



<p>“That’s totally fine.”</p>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, I don’t have any plans for the rest of the lunch break, so I nod in agreement.</p>



<p>Even so, there’s only about fifteen minutes left of lunch break, so we don’t need to move elsewhere, but… I somehow knew what she wanted to talk about.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>“You know, ever since you and Otonashi-san started dating, Shu-kun has changed.”</p>



<p>“…Yeah.”</p>



<p>That’s right, it’s about Shu after all.</p>



<p>I know that Iori has no intention of blaming me for changing her beloved Shu. She continues to stare at me as she speaks.</p>


<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/image-06.jpg"/>


<p>“I also noticed that Shu-kun had feelings for Otonashi-san, and I was aware of that. I was even approaching him while liking him. Although I got to know Shu-kun through Otonashi-san, I started to like him as I talked to him sincerely.”</p>



<p>“……….”</p>



<p>Iori… She really likes Shu from the bottom of her heart.</p>



<p>As she fiddles with the hair near my ear, I find myself almost mesmerized by her sorrowful expression.</p>




<p>[Towa-kun?]</p>



<p>Oh no, just when I felt that way, I thought I heard the voice of the Demon King… no, Ayana. But I want to believe it’s just my imagination.</p>



<p>I need to focus on Iori’s words now!</p>



<p>“I’ve never liked anyone before… but the time I spent with Shu-kun was really enjoyable. No other boy has talked back to me or competed with me like he did. Yes… it was really fun.”</p>



<p>“……….”</p>



<p>“So I thought the current situation was good for me, and for Uchida-san too. But Shu-kun only has eyes for Otonashi-san. He always looks down and mutters something as if resenting someone…”</p>



<p>“…I see.”</p>



<p>I felt reassured because Iori often came to call Shu, and he always responded, but does he still drag Ayana’s matter so much?</p>



<p>But… even hearing such stories, I have no regrets and no sympathy—I suppose that’s what love is about.</p>




<p>“Whatever I do or whatever words I say, Shu-kun doesn’t pay attention to me… and that makes me feel a little empty when it continues.”</p>



<p>“That’s… maybe the same for Mari too?”</p>



<p>“She said the same thing. She still seems to love Shu-kun, but she wants to keep her distance for a while.”</p>



<p>I see… So Mari decided to keep her distance from Shu.</p>



<p>I see Shu talking to them as usual, but I don’t know what they’re talking about.</p>



<p>From Iori’s story, it seems that Shu is dragging Ayana’s matter too much, even in front of them… I’m sure Iori and Mari don’t like that.</p>



<p>“…And what about you, President?”</p>



<p>“I… Well, I don’t particularly want to keep my distance, but as I said earlier, it’s painful to feel empty. It would be easy if he just relied on me without thinking… but there probably wouldn’t be happiness beyond that.”</p>



<p>“……….”</p>




<p>“Love is difficult, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>Iori says with a smile.</p>



<p>Despite saying that it’s empty, painful, and there’s no happiness, she doesn’t seem to be affected at all. I don’t think there’s any need to worry about Iori—she’s really strong.</p>



<p>“Well, I’ll continue to think about Shu-kun slowly while dating him. So don’t make such a face, Yukishiro-kun.”</p>



<p>“…Eh?”</p>



<p>“You can’t hide a look of apology, can you?”</p>



<p>“…Really?”</p>



<p>I didn’t mean to show such an expression, but… Iorilightly taps my cheek, and then she gently strokes my cheek… huh!?</p>



<p>“W-What are you doing?”</p>




<p>“Your face looked red and a little painful, no? But I understand now.”</p>



<p>After staring at me for a moment, Iori says something like this.</p>



<p>“You’re handsome, Yukishiro-kun, but there are moments when I want to pamper you. Even I find you so cute that I get flustered… Does Otonashi-san feel this way while being by your side?”</p>



<p>“…I wonder.”</p>



<p>“Fufu♪”</p>



<p>Iori smiled beautifully once again. After parting ways with her as she mentioned about returning, I also headed back to the classroom.</p>



<p>“Welcome back, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“!?!”</p>



<p>As soon as I entered the classroom, I was greeted by Ayana, who was smiling cheerfully.</p>




<p>“Why are you standing at the entrance like this?” I wondered, ignoring her somewhat imposing expression. When I glanced away from Ayana towards the classroom, I noticed that Ayana’s friends seemed to be having fun, but what caught my attention was how the boys quickly averted their gazes as if they had seen a demon.</p>



<p>“Ayana…san?”</p>



<p>“Yes♪”</p>



<p>Is that a hallucination, seeing flame effects behind her smiling face!?</p>



<p>As if infected by the atmosphere of the other boys, I found myself cautiously observing Ayana’s demeanor… But what’s really going on?</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“No, no, it’s nothing like that! I didn’t feel any indication of you being attracted to another girl while I wasn’t around, Towa-kun♪”</p>



<p>“……………”</p>



<p>“Oya, oya, why are you looking down, Towa-kun?”</p>




<p>K-Kkkkkkkkoooooooooeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?!?!?!?</p>



<p>I had a strong feeling from Ayana’s words, and I even had auditory hallucinations of her voice in my head… Eh? Is Ayana some kind of psychic or something?</p>



<p>“Just kidding, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“……Phew”</p>



<p>“I’ll ask for more details after school, okay?”</p>



<p>“……Yeah”</p>



<p>She’s starting to look like a demon to me now.</p>



<p>Although it’s a chilling exchange for me, perhaps to my classmates, it might seem like a heated couple exchange. Or maybe the girls’ gaze just feels lukewarm after all.</p>



<p>“Well then, Towa-kun, see you later.”</p>




<p>“Ouyo.”</p>



<p>After that, I returned to my seat, and soon the afternoon classes began, starting the battle against drowsiness.</p>



<p>Despite spending time with Ayana lately, I don’t intend to stay up late enough to feel the effects the next day, but I still end up feeling incredibly sleepy.</p>



<p>Even so, I try to avoid sleeping by pinching my cheeks or thighs to stay awake, as it’s already nearing the end of today’s final class, physical education.</p>



<p>“I’m tired…”</p>



<p>“Fufu, good job.”</p>



<p>I was cleaning up the equipment used in physical education with Ayana.</p>



<p>Although both boys and girls had outdoor physical education, I volunteered to clean up, and Ayana is helping me.</p>



<p>(Two people alone in the equipment room… this is quite a common situation.)</p>




<p>In romantic comedy manga or anime, the scene where the heroine gets locked in the equipment room is a classic, but it’s not realistic for someone to lock it from the outside.</p>



<p>“This… is the scenario where the heroine gets locked in, right?”</p>



<p>“Aah… Did I say it out loud?”</p>



<p>“No? That means Towa-kun was thinking the same thing, right♪”</p>



<p>Well, it’s natural to think about it in this situation.</p>



<p>Usually, there’s a lucky pervert situation or some exciting romantic exchange when you’re locked in, but we don’t need any lucky pervert situations anymore… But maybe I wanted to experience it a little.</p>



<p>“Well then, shall we head back soon?”</p>



<p>Let’s go back. Just as I was about to say that, the door of the equipment room where we were closed with a clang.</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>




<p>“…Ara?”</p>



<p>Ayana and I both turned our gaze towards the back.</p>



<p>The door we entered through was neatly closed, and the sound of it being locked reverberated through our eardrums unexpectedly. Stunned by this unexpected turn of events, neither of us could move, and we stood there blankly for some reason.</p>



<p>“Ah…”</p>



<p>“…Ha!”</p>



<p>Finally, we hurriedly rushed to the door.</p>



<p>Because we were too slow to react, there was already no sign of anyone outside the door, and there was no response even when we called out.</p>



<p>“Seriously?”</p>



<p>“Is this really happening…”</p>




<p>We had been talking about the situation of being trapped in the equipment room, saying that it wouldn’t happen in reality, and now this unexpected turn of events left me scratching my head.</p>



<p>“What should we do?”</p>



<p>“Hmm…”</p>



<p>Since it’s time for the end-of-day meeting, there probably won’t be anyone nearby, and although there’s a small window letting in light, it’s barely big enough for a person to pass through, so I don’t even consider attempting to escape through there… Well, that would be a last resort.</p>



<p>“Anyway, they’ll notice that Ayana and I are missing during the meeting. Even if we’re ignored, someone will probably notice once club activities start.”</p>



<p>“That’s true… fufu.”</p>



<p>“What’s so funny?”</p>



<p>“Sorry. It’s just that, with Towa-kun here, any accident seems fun to me.”</p>



<p>I was about to say she’s a troublesome girl, but I ended up laughing along with her.</p>




<p>Ayana was already resigned to wait until someone came, and she sat down on a stack of vaulting boxes.</p>



<p>“How about you sit down too, Towa-kun?”</p>



<p>“Right. I might as well take it easy too.”</p>



<p>I brushed off the dust from the mat and lay down beside it.</p>



<p>Perhaps because of the exercise, the drowsiness that should have disappeared from my body returned, and I yawned unabashedly enough to make Ayana laugh.</p>



<p>“You look really sleepy, huh?”</p>



<p>“Yeah… I’ve been feeling it since the fifth period.”</p>



<p>“You shouldn’t have stayed up too late… Well, sometimes you just feel sleepy no matter how much you sleep, so it’s not weird.”</p>



<p>“Yeah… *yawn*”</p>




<p>I feel like closing my eyes… I’m so sleepy.</p>



<p>Since there’s nothing else to do but wait, I decided to sleep comfortably, but then I heard the sound of someone lying down nearby—the one and only Ayana.</p>



<p>“Ehehe, maybe I’ll lie down too. I want to see Towa-kun’s sleeping face up close.”</p>



<p>“…It’s not funny.”</p>



<p>“It’s not about whether it’s funny or not. I just want to see the sleeping face of the person I like.”</p>



<p>Ayana stared at me intently.</p>



<p>I thought it might be okay to sleep while she’s staring at me like that, but as I closed my eyelids… I seemed to have fallen asleep for a little while.</p>



<p>Because when I opened my eyes again, the door of the equipment room was open.</p>



<p>“So, you were here after all…”</p>




<p>“Ayana! Are you… okay?”</p>



<p>I didn’t look towards the door, but I recognized the voices.</p>



<p>The male voice belonged to Somiya, who had previously been involved in the incident with Shu, and the female voice was probably Todo, who always gets along well with Ayana.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, help has arrived.”</p>



<p>“…Yeah.”</p>



<p>Even though I had only slept for a short time, my head felt a bit foggy.</p>



<p>With Ayana’s help, I sat up, and then my gaze finally met the blushing faces of Somiya and the others who were staring at us.</p>



<p>(Why is this happening… ah)</p>



<p>The first thing that they opened the door to the warehouse was the sight of a man and a woman lying down and staring at each other… There’s nothing particularly suspicious going on, but there’s definitely room for imagination, indeed.</p>




<p>“…I might have shown a bit of a bad timing.”</p>



<p>“But we didn’t do anything. Shall we get up, Towa-kun?”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>We promptly got up, and Ayana and I exited the equipment shed.</p>



<p>“Thanks, Somiya .”</p>



<p>“No problem, but… I was relieved when I realized it wasn’t anything lewd.”</p>



<p>“As if we would.”</p>



<p>Somiya laughed at my quick comeback.</p>



<p>By the way… similar exchanges were happening behind us.</p>




<p>“I’m glad nothing happened.”</p>



<p>“Oh, were you expecting something to happen?”</p>



<p>“No way!!”</p>



<p>“Fufu~♪”</p>



<p>…Was there some sort of expectation?</p>



<p>While I’d like to say I’m aware of the time and place, given Towa’s memories of doing such things with Ayana at school, if the atmosphere and various other factors align, I might not be aware of what’s happening…?</p>



<p>“At any rate, I’m glad we’re safe. I was prepared to wait until club activities started at the worst.”</p>



<p>“I noticed you weren’t there when the rehearsal started. Then I realized you weren’t here either.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>




<p>“Thought maybe you two were fooling around.”</p>



<p>“…Did you say that?”</p>



<p>“Nah, nah! That was Todo!”</p>



<p>The way he’s panicking seems suspicious…</p>



<p>As I gaze at Somiya, he desperately waves his hands in front of his face, as if to say it’s not him… Hmm.</p>



<p>“You and Todo-san seem to get along well?”</p>



<p>“Ou! We even went out together recently… Ah, never mind.”</p>



<p>“Hoh~?”</p>



<p>I’m curious about Somiya’s demeanor… but I’ll refrain from probing further.</p>




<p>By the way, Todo, whose name has been mentioned several times, is the girl who came to search with Somiya. She’s the girl in class who gets along best with Ayana.</p>



<p>A while ago, it was Setsuna Todo-san who invited Somiyato karaoke during the dispute with Shu.</p>



<p>(Come to think of it, Ayana mentioned a bit about it. Seems like Somiya and Todo-san get along pretty well.)</p>



<p>While I’m not particularly close to Somiya or Todo-san, I like seeing Ayana happily talking about her friends.</p>



<p>“Well, I hope things work out for them. Seeing Ayana happily talking about her friends makes me happy too.”</p>



<p>“Is that so… ehehe, I’ll do my best.”</p>



<p>As we exchanged such remarks and tried to enter the classroom, I bumped into someone.</p>



<p>“Oops, sorry.”</p>



<p>“No, it’s fi–“</p>




<p>The person I bumped into… was Shu.</p>



<p>Shu initially seemed flustered and said it was okay, but as soon as he realized it was me, his gaze sharpened.</p>



<p>He doesn’t need to show that much hostility… But I think pointing it out here would only make things worse, so I didn’t say anything. However, Somiya was different.</p>



<p>“You both bumped into each other, so what’s with that attitude?”</p>



<p>“It’s fine. It’s a delicate time right now.” </p>



<p>I said, and Somiya, true to his character, fell silent.</p>



<p>If he knows about Shu’s situation as a classmate, he should understand what’s going on with him, just like Aisaka. And if he’s close to Todo-san, he must know even more.</p>



<p>“So please don’t worry too much.” </p>



<p>“Got it. I won’t say anything to Sasaki.”</p>




<p>While I wouldn’t take that as a sign of gratitude, I appreciated it nonetheless. I thanked him and entered the classroom.</p>



<p>After that, it was soon time for dismissal.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun. Shall we go home?”</p>



<p>As Ayana approached with her bag, I nodded, and we left the classroom.</p>



<p>Today, we planned for Ayana to come over to my house and then go home after getting her things organized.</p>



<p>It’s a bit sad that she’s going home….but it’s already decided, so there’s no use worrying about it.</p>



<p>“Oh, by the way, Towa-kun.” </p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“Do you remember what happened at lunch?”</p>




<p>“Lunch?”</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>Ayana smiled, reminding me of what happened that afternoon.</p>



<p>“You felt captivated by someone, remember?”</p>



<p>“Ah…”</p>



<p>I must have had a dumbfounded expression at that moment.</p>



<p>Ayana smiled silently, but her intimidating presence from earlier in the day still lingered, making me feel a bit terrified—not that I was scared, but her presence was… almost like a demon lord!</p>



<p>I braced myself.</p>



<p>Like a brave hero who never fears even in front of a demon lord without any weapons, I stood there, showing courage!</p>




<p>“Don’t waste your time with nonsense. Just surrender already.”</p>



<p>“Alright.”</p>



<p>I admitted defeat!</p>



<p>I straightened up and, since there was no need to hide anything, I told her everything that happened during lunch break.</p>



<p>“I see. So you talked with Honjo-senpai and Mari-chan about that?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, well… that’s what happened.”</p>



<p>After I explained what happened during lunch, it seemed that Ayana had something on her mind too.</p>



<p>We continued walking, and as if she had organized her thoughts, Keina continued speaking.</p>



<p>“In the end, it’s just a heartbreak for Shu-kun. There’s no need for you and me to worry too much. But it was me who involved those girls more than necessary with Shu-kun… In that sense, I do have some thoughts about it.”</p>




<p>However, Ayana continued.</p>



<p>“To be honest, at this point, there’s no need to worry about anything. When I decided to give up on the path that was supposed to continue… Well, I don’t think I’m at fault.”</p>



<p>“Haha… Well, that’s true.”</p>



<p>Certainly, at this point, Ayana didn’t do anything wrong.</p>



<p>If things had gone as originally planned, what Ayana did could have been the beginning of a catastrophe. But in the current situation, all she did was help Shu expand his circle of friends.</p>



<p>“This is already like resignation. Normally, in a typical relationship, one would worry about the current state of Shu-kun. But in our case, things have already become complicated. So, all we can do is wait for time to resolve it. That’s all there is to it.”</p>



<p>“…..Right.”</p>



<p>I really am thinking too deeply about this, aren’t I?</p>



<p>I guess it’s better to think a bit more flexibly, like Ayana, and just believe that time will resolve things… Alright, I’ll do that too.</p>




<p>“Life doesn’t always go as planned, huh?”</p>



<p>“Have you suddenly aged?”</p>



<p>“That’s not something you say to a girl, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Sorry.”</p>



<p>“I forgive you.”</p>



<p>We both chuckled in sync with each other’s rhythm.</p>



<p>Thanks to the conversation with Ayana, it felt like a weight had been lifted off my chest… Thanks, Ayana.</p>



<p>“Now then, let’s talk more about that incident where you were captivated by Honjo-senpai.”</p>



<p>“Didn’t we finish talking about that?”</p>




<p>“Nope, not yet!”</p>



<p>In the end, the topic was dragged out until we reached home… Haa.</p>



<p>And then—</p>



<p>“Well, Towa-kun, that’s it for today.”</p>



<p>“Ah… I’ll miss you.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. We’ll see each other at school, and most importantly, we can go on dates on weekends.”</p>



<p>“We can even go on dates after school.”</p>



<p>“Yes♪”</p>



<p>After tightly embracing Ayana at the entrance, feeling a tinge of reluctance as she walked away with a smile, I returned to the empty house and sank deeply into the sofa in the living room, which seemed unusually spacious.</p>




<p>“It feels bigger… Was it always like this?”</p>



<p>Just her absence makes it feel like this… It makes me realize how significant her presence is.</p>



<p>“Mom must be out shopping? …Ah, it’s so quiet.”</p>



<p>With nothing to do, I turned on the TV to pass the time.</p>



<p>Comedians were performing their routines on TV, but I didn’t even crack a smile. Time passed slowly.</p>



<p>“…It’s peaceful.”</p>



<p>While I miss Ayana, there’s something profound about this empty, idle time, a result of my own actions.</p>



<p>After spending about an hour and a half leisurely, when I returned to the room, I found something unexpected.</p>



<p>“Eh…?”</p>




<p>On my desk lay Ayana’s phone.</p>



<p>Since she’s not at home, there’s no reason for it to be here. That’s when it hit me—I had forgotten about it.</p>



<p>“…It must be inconvenient for her. What should I do?”</p>



<p>She might come back for it if she realizes she’s forgotten it, but realistically, she’s probably not coming back. Maybe she hasn’t even noticed it’s missing yet.</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>Considering how inconvenient it would be without her phone… I made a decision.</p>



<p>“I’ll take it to Ayana’s house.”</p>



<p>After sending a message to my mom informing her that I’ll be out for a while, I securely put Ayana’s phone in my pocket and left the house.</p>
