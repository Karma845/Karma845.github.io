<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 1: A Fresh Start</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Eaten, chewed,
dismembered, and burned.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Arcazam engulfed in
flames. In his nightmares, Nozomu fought against the giant dragon and kept
getting killed. Death that arrives easily, repeatedly falling into intense pain,
weakness, and emptiness.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ugh......!"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">There is no point in
thinking about the difference in power. But still, at the very least, he won't
give up his heart and soul.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">With that in mind, he
resists the feeling of emptiness that envelops his entire being every time he
dies.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">And when he comes to
his senses, the figure of a giant dragon appears before his eyes once again.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">The dragon looks down
at Nozomu with a loathsome expression, and then attacks again. Facing a
one-sided battle that could end at any moment, he still raised his sword in an
attempt to fight back......</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">[Oi Nozomu, what are
you doing!?]</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">A strong, loud voice
echoed in his mind. Immediately after, he felt as if he were being pulled out
of the water and was illuminated by a dazzling light. In the blinding light,
Arcazam, which was engulfed in flames, disappeared along with the giant dragon.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">His consciousness
rapidly awakens. What was seen beyond the light was .......</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;"></span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Uwaaaa!"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu suddenly
regained consciousness accompanied by a scream that echoed in his ears.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">In front of him was a
boy clad in the uniform of the Soluminati Academy who fell on his butt. There
is a threat looming toward him with a large, gooey, unnerving mouth spread
wide.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">It is a demonic beast
called a Blob, whose mucus-like body is lifted up and attacks him as though
trying to engulf him. Basically, it is an aquatic creature that grows on
nutrients in the water, but larger ones come to land to seek higher nutritional
value. This included large creatures, including humans.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu reflexively
jumped in front of the boy and unsheathed his beloved katana, [Mumei], which he
carried at his waist.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">With a single, precise
strike, he cleaved the Blob in two with the very nucleus inside its body.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">After the nucleus was
severed, the Blob trembled and then collapsed with a splashing sound.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Phew......."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">He exhaled and looked
around the dimly lit surroundings. The torch flames and magical lights
illuminated the waterway, which had an arched ceiling. They are in the
underground canal of Arcazam. The time is early in the morning.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu, are you
okay?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina rushed to
Nozomu's side after he defeated the Blob.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Behind her, her best
friend, Tima, and Mars, who is in the same class as Nozomu, were following her.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, sorry
Iris, I was spacing out."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"That doesn't
sound like you. What's wrong?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"That guy, was
bothering me a little......."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Hearing Nozomu's
implied words, her expression turned grim for a moment, followed by a
melancholy one.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Tiamat, the Dragon
King.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">An extraordinarily
great calamity that Nozomu has been forced to face. If released, it is an
existence that could bring fatal disasters not only to Arcazam, but also to the
entire continent of Arkmel.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Are you,
alright?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hm? Yeah, it's
all good now."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina's expression
remained stiff in contrast to Nozomu, who sheathed his katana in a nonchalant
manner. Because she knew that in such situations, he often left out the words
[for now].</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">At the same time, she
bit her lip slightly, feeling frustrated and helpless.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Even if she knew what
was going on, Irisdina had no way to solve Nozomu's problem.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Her frustration and
anxiety stirred in her heart.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu, perhaps
sensing her feelings, smiled gently at Irisdina.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Thank you, Iris.
Anyway, we gotta confirm about the blob."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, I guess
so......."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Despite being at a
loss for words, Irisdina tried her best to refocus her mind.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">The reason why they
are here this time is because of a request from the guild.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">The content is to
investigate the Arcazam underground waterway.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">In Arcazam,
underground water is pumped up at facilities called [water pumping buildings]
in each area and distributed to various parts of the city through waterways
that are spread out like a network.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">These are clearly
divided into water supply and sewage systems, and basically, no demonic beasts
are allowed to enter the water supply system.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">However, a few days
ago, a construction worker inspecting the waterway informed the guild that
there were demonic beasts in the water supply system.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Are you guys all
right? Are you hurt?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina called out to
a group of students who were being attacked by a group of Blob.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">They were a party of
four, a mixed party of men and women, wearing the same Soluminati Academy
uniforms as Nozomu and the others.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Upon checking the
insignia on their chests, they seemed to be students of the first grade.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"T-Thank you! My
name is Eldor, a first-class first-grade student!"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">A boy, the leader of
the party, bowed his head, his face flushed in front of Irisdina. He is the
male student that Nozomu rescued. Irisdina was originally a celebrity at the
school and popular among both men and women alike. Her name seems to be
well-known even among the freshmen who have just joined the school this year.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Excuse me, but
can you tell me a few things about these Blobs?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Y-Yes!"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">After listening to
their story, Irisdina learned that they were passing through a passageway that
led from the sewers to the aqueduct when they found the group of Blobs tightly
packed in the passageway. They were attacked at this moment.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">They were fighting in
the narrow passageway while running away from the encroaching Blobs that were
about to squash them, and to begin with, their mucus-like bodies made it
difficult for them to use their weapons. They could have handled the situation
if they had calmly dealt with it by aiming at the nucleus or using magic, but
they still lacked combat experience, and their stamina and magic power were
depleted as they struggled.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">They were in a
desperate situation when Nozomu and the others rushed to their rescue.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Thank you, I
understand now. You guys should go back to the surface. We'll handle things
from here on out."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"B-But......"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Just get the
hell out of here. You're just dragging us down if you're trying to lead a bunch
of people who can't move well at all."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Although Irisdina
tried to persuade them, the underclassmen persisted. Then Mars interjected. His
words may sound cold to the outsider, but Nozomu immediately understands that
they are a rather awkward reminder from Mars' point of view.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">However, hearing his
words, the freshmen, who were originally called geniuses in their hometown and
had just arrived at the Soluminati Academy with great expectations, became
self-conscious that their abilities were not as good as they thought they were.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">This caused them to
look at Nozomu with suspicion, frustration, and a hint of disdain.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Apparently, these
underclassmen were aware of the rumor that Nozomu was the lowest-ranking
student in the third grade and a scumbag who had betrayed his childhood
sweetheart.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"But we're pretty
much all D-rank which is rare among first graders! At least, we're better than
this seni-"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Watch your
words. He's a C-ranker. His rank is higher than yours."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Eldor was
unintentionally trying to mend his damaged self-esteem. But Irisdina dismissed
him. Her cold voice made the underclassmen tremble, and they looked at Nozomu
in surprise.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Until recently,
Nozomu's rank was D, the same as them. Perhaps they did not know that Nozomu
had recently advanced in rank.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"The rumors about
him that are circulating in the academy are completely unfounded. Besides, he's
my precious ...... friend. In fact, he saved your life, too, didn't he? Insulting
your benefactor would be disgraceful......"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Although her voice was
clear and sincere, it carried a hint of anger. The first-year students were
completely overwhelmed by her tone of voice. Nozomu called out to stop her from
becoming more intimidating than necessary.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Iris......."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"......My
apologies, I got a little carried away. In any case, you guys should go
back."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Unable to say anything
back to her, the first-year students trudged back to the surface. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Watching their backs
disappear into the corner of the waterway, Irisdina let out a sigh and slumped
her shoulders.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Tima, Mars-kun,
I apologize to you as well. I didn't mean to make a fuss......."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's okay, Ai,
don't worry about it."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, I would
have said more if you hadn't."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Tima smiled back at
the apologetic Irisdina, and Mars waved his hand placidly.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"But, Mars-kun,
you could have said it a little nicer."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"Aa? No way. If
they, who only just arrived this year, are doing too well, it's about time
things would get to their heads......"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"But there should
be a better way to say it ...... right?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Tima smiled and
intimidated Mars, who had no intention of correcting his misleading use of
words.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Mars broke out in a
cold sweat and replied in a trembling voice, "I-I'll be more
careful.......". They have been training together often since the Rugato
incident, and recently they seem to be getting even closer.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina's mouth
relaxed a little upon seeing them, but her expression immediately stiffened and
she peeked at Nozomu, who was standing beside her. Seeing the glint of worry in
her eyes, he smiled wryly.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"You don't have
to worry about me either...... but well, thanks for getting mad for my sake,
Iris."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">She was indeed a bit
excessive, but her words were made out of consideration for Nozomu.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu himself
understands this. That's why he is so grateful. Irisdina, who had been glancing
at Nozomu's face, was finally relieved when she heard those words.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Thank
goodness. Well then, let's proceed."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span lang="EN-US" style=""><span style="font-family: arial;">The group then began
to go deeper into the waterway to continue their investigation.</span></span></p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>‡</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As it turns out,
Nozomu and his party's investigation was somewhat successful.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sewage system that
drains sewage out of the city, the magic circle at the outlet of the drain was
not functioning.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This city is famous as
an academic city, but it actually has another name.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Arcazam, an
experimental ritual magic city.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A city designed to
utilize the dragon veins, the flow of the world's power. Arcazam is a prototype
of this concept.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Facilities built under
this concept are located in various parts of the city, which radiate weak magic
power to areas that are connected to the outside of the city and are easily
accessible to demonic beasts. At the same time, many efforts are made to
prevent them from approaching the city.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Naturally, these
facilities are also installed in the underground waterways, but a part of the
magic circle at the outlet of the sewage system was broken.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Fortunately, Tima was
able to temporarily restore the function of the damaged part by drawing a new
magic circle. Later, the guild, upon receiving the report, would repair it
completely through the City Management Department.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sun was already
rising in the south when Nozomu and his team went outside after completing a
series of reports at the guild. It was noon.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"By the way,
Nozomu-kun, have you seen the results of the last Special Comprehensive
Exercise?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hm? No, I
haven't...... Wasn't that exercise sort of ruined?"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Special Comprehensive
Exercise. A large-scale exercise that all third-year students participated in
about two weeks ago.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is one of the
biggest events in the third grade, and one that directly affects the school's
grades.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, there was an
unexpected problem. During the exercise, one of the [The Six Bad Omens] demonic
beasts appeared.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was called the
[Cracked-Crown] Giant Centipede. It was a disaster-class demonic beast with a
body length of more than 100 meters.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As a result, the
Special Comprehensive Exercise was stopped halfway. Naturally, Nozomu thought
he would not receive any points.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's true. But
the first day of the exercise went on until the end of the day, you know. So,
the results up to that point were to be announced."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hee......"</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu, who had been
branded as the bottom-feeder in the first place, was slow to react when told
that he might receive some points. Besides, the things that happened after that
were so much more significant that he honestly had completely forgotten about
the Special Comprehensive Exercise.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Before long, Nozomu
and his party arrived at the Ox-head Pavilion in the commercial district. It is
Mars' house, a tavern and inn, to which Nozomu is his friend. They opened the
entrance door and went inside. Perhaps because it was lunchtime, there were a
fair number of people in there. Amidst the crowd, a girl holding a tray with
food on it with both hands was running around busily.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Good afternoon,
Ena-chan."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, Nozomu-san.
Welcome~~! Your friends are already here."</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her name is Ena

about to kill Lisa, Nozomu hesitated and stopped by reflexively turning the
entire attack on himself, but his actions to that point had left him severely
depressed. As a result, he lost sight of himself and his relationship with
Irisdina and the others cracked, which had various negative effects on him.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">All because he did not

his anger out and spoken his mind to Irisdina and the others, Nozomu, to his

wave to Tima and the others and walked out of the restaurant along with Nozomu.
The blue-haired elf girl watched their backs with wistful eyes.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that moment, Mars
suddenly stood up and went to stand in front of Tom.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-What is

at being looked down by the imposing Mars, Mars opened his mouth with a
mysterious expression on his face.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Are you

don't think there's a single alchemist who wouldn't be interested in a

his eyes upon hearing Mars' next words and smiled the same inhuman smile that

lunch at Ox-head Pavilion, Shina left the restaurant ahead of the others.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her destination was
the school's library. When she reached the library, she pulled out a random
book from a random shelf and opened the cover to hide her face in a corner of
the bookshelf.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She tried to trace the
series of letters on the page, but the content of the book did not seem to sink
in at all.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A pain...... ran
through the depths of her chest. A sigh naturally escaped from her mouth, her
face tensed up, and she bit her lip.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She knew why she
couldn't concentrate.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And her spirit friend
who was always by her side has disappeared before she knew it. He must have
given her some time alone. She was a little grateful for that. Because she
didn't want anyone to see the current state of her.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What the heck am
I doing......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A whisper echoed in
the dim shade of the bookshelf. The scene at the Ox-head Pavilion from earlier
flashed through her mind.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina's usual noble
atmosphere seemed to disappear, and her face was tense. What was peeking out
from the depths of her eyes, which were shaken with anxiety, was the faint
feelings she had for him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina's face as she
gazed at Nozomu, shaking with emotion, was so beautiful that one could not help
but admire it. Even Shina, who is of the same sex, couldn't help but gasp.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina herself knew.
The feelings that Irisdina had for Nozomu. In the battle against the
[Cracked-Crown] Giant Centipede, she had used contract magic to connect
Nozomu's and Irisdina's spirits.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But when she witnessed
it firsthand, she felt an inexpressible emotion tighten deep within her chest.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Why, am I not
that happy about it......"</span></span></p>

of dissatisfaction slipped out of her mouth, and she hated herself for that,
and let out an even heavier sigh. She repeated such a thing over and over again
until she came to the library from Ox-head Pavilion.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As if to refresh her
mind, she returned the book on the table to the shelf. As she wandered
aimlessly through the forest of bookshelves, Shina's eyes caught sight of the
entrance to the corridor leading to the closed shelves.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's......."</span></span></p>

where Nozomu had saved Shina, who at the time was still being ridiculed and
teased as a [withered-leaf ear]. Unexpectedly, her body staggered toward this
place.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The empty passageway
was deserted. The pain in her chest increased from the loneliness.</span></span></p>

Shina.</span></span></p>

around, a familiar wolf girl was staring at her with a doubtful expression.</span></span></p>

scratched her cheeks a little awkwardly. She was the girl who used to harass
Shina maliciously.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The wolf tribe
originally lived in the eastern part of the continent, but they had a feud with
the elves during the [Great Invasion] 20 years ago. Because of this, they had
been persistently pestering Shina, who had lost the ability to sense spirits at
the time. She was also the one who was harassing Shina in the library leading
to these closed shelves.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, the feud was
resolved after the battle against a demonic beast called Abyss Grief, and the
wolf tribe that had been harassing her apologized to her. Since then, they have
been able to have normal conversations.</span></span></p>

off in the direction of the day after tomorrow, and Karanti squinted at her.</span></span></p>

so, Karanti took Shina's hand and started walking.</span></span></p>

pulled and held a few books randomly from a random shelf along the way. Next to
her, Karanti was picking up some books as well. The two then headed straight to
the reading area.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When they arrived at
the reading area, Karanti walked over to the trio, who stood out from the
others.</span></span></p>

light yellowish green hair who had just been with her at the Ox-head Pavilion earlier,
and one dark-haired female student wearing Ekross uniform, a school affiliated
with Solminati Academy. And a mature woman in a maid's uniform, which was out

seated at her desk with a book open, looking serious as she studied. The maid
stood beside her, as if watching over her, and gave her a gentle gaze.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While smiling at
Tima's usual shyness, Shina peeked at the book she had opened out of curiosity.
The contents of the book were related to wind magic and control techniques for
strengthening magic, and there was also a stack of books related to Qi-jutsu.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina could guess what
Tima was researching and her cheeks relaxed involuntarily.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I see, it's
related to Mars-kun......."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ue!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tima let out a silly
voice. What she was researching was the super-advanced technique [magic-Qi
combination technique] that Mars was trying to master.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I don't mean to
startle you. More importantly, how are things going? Even though it is not as
powerful as Nozomu-kun's [power], I don't think the technique that Mars is
aiming for is going to be achieved overnight."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, we don't
have a clear picture yet. But, Mars-kun, he's been a little less reckless
lately."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, after what
happened, he must have mixed feelings about it."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tima nodded her head
slightly at Shina's words.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mars has a strong
attachment to power due to his childhood experiences. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In fact, he had
feelings akin to admiration for Nozomu's superior Qi-jutsu and hidden power,
while at the same time harboring mixed feelings about his own desire to reach
that same realm.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mars discovered a
method to catch up with Nozomu, the magic-Qi combination technique. By fusing
magic and Qi-jutsu, which by their nature oppose each other, this technique drastically
increases the effectiveness of both.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, two weeks
ago, during the Special Comprehensive Exercise, Mars was so impatient that he
used a technique that he could not fully control against the [Cracked-Crown]
Giant Centipede.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As a result, Mars put
his friends in a predicament, and a fatal rift developed between him and
Nozomu.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Fortunately, everyone
involved was unharmed, and the rift that had developed between the two was able
to be repaired, but if the buttons had been pushed just a little bit wrong, the
situation would have been fatal.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But still, it's
very kind of you to come all the way to the library to help him with his
research."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-I don't mind
...... I just, umm...... I thought it would be nice if I could be of
help......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina was impressed
but somewhat envious of Tima, who kept on moving her pen while looking down
with a fidgety look on her face.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey, why do you
care so much about him?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I know Mars-kun
is not a bad person, but he can be a little rough around the edges sometimes.
He seems like the type of guy you would rather avoid, so I thought it was a
little strange that you liked him so much."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina found herself
asking Tima a direct question.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Hearing the word "like"
made Tima's slightly flushed cheeks turn bright red at once.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-W-What do you
mean by like!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Did you
really think no one noticed it?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, it's
pretty obvious, after all."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karanti, who had been
standing next to Shina, watching and listening to what was going on, couldn't
help but voice her agreement, and Somia and Mena were also nodding their heads
in agreement.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A-Auu......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tima held her
vermilion-stained face in her hands, writhing in agony for a while, but eventually,
she took a deep breath and slowly opened her mouth, as if conceding.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"At first ......
I was so scared of him, you know? The first time I saw him, he suddenly glared
at me, and Mars didn't have a good impression of me, either. I'm a gloomy
person after all......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She confessed while
looking up at the ceiling as if looking far into the distance.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tima herself has the
highest level of magical power in the whole continent, but her character is
timid. She herself does not like her self-deprecating personality. That is why
she admires dignified women like Irisdina and dislikes men with strong
personalities and rough language like Mars.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But when
Rugato-san came and Somia-chan's life was in danger, it was Mars-kun who saved
me."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">An irreplaceable
family of a dear friend. A girl who was like a sister to Tima as well. Hearing
this, the girl next to her was scratching her cheeks in a slightly embarrassed
manner.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A high-ranking envoy
was trying to extract Somia's soul. It was Mars who blocked the magic bullet that
pounced on Tima and knocked it away. The very person who she thought that he
disliked her</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sense of unity she
felt at that moment. Since then, every time she thought of him, there would be
a warm feeling that would seep into the depths of her body. Sometimes it
stirred her heart violently, and at other times it gave her warmth as if she
was wrapped in cotton to the tips of her hands and feet.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I can't say it
well, but it bothers me a lot......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tima cannot honestly
put these feelings into words. It's also in her nature to take a step back from
others. But there is no need to put it into words.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her cheeks were
stained with vermilion. Above all, when talking about Mars, she never once
looked downward. She was shy and would tend to look downward when talking to
other people.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even if she wasn't
aware of it, her demeanor clearly conveyed her thoughts and feelings.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I
see......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While Shina's envy was
being fueled once again upon seeing Tima like this, a familiar loud voice was
heard.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yahho~, Shina.
Tima-san, Somicchi, and ...... Karanti? What a very unusual line-up."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was Shina's best
friend, Mimuru, who called out to her.</span></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The girl from the
Cat-tailed Tribe and a classmate, rolled her eyes when she saw Karanti sitting
at the same table as Shina. Although they had reconciled, they had been on bad
terms until recently. Surely she would be surprised.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Mimuru? There's
no way you would ever come to the library by yourself, so Tom must be with you.
Where is he?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You're saying an
awful thing, Shina. Even I would read at least a book!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina started to look
around for her other companion when Mimuru appeared. Mimuru's cheeks puffed out
in dissatisfaction at her best friend's behavior, and she held up the books in
her hand as if to refute her friend. The titles of the books were about
attribute interference theory, fluctuations in reaction rates due to magical
qualities, and other seemingly complicated topics. No matter how one looked at
it, it was not the kind of book Mimuru would read.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As Shina gazed at the
books with suspicion, a small boy with glasses appeared from behind the bookshelf.
He was carrying a stack of books in his arms, and once he noticed Shina and the
others, he put the books on a nearby desk and approached them.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Shina, we meet
again. Oh, Mimuru, I see you brought me the materials I was looking for. Thank
you."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Hearing Tom's words,
Mimuru froze while Shina let out a small sigh.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... I knew it
was Tom who had business in the library."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmm? What is
it?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina glared at Mimuru
for lying. Mimuru's little lie was exposed in a flash, and she looked downward
with a red face and trembled her shoulders from embarrassment.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tom, on the other
hand, who couldn't grasp the situation, just tilted his head.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"T-Tom, you
idiot―!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"E-Eh!?
Why~!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mimuru, who could no
longer stand the embarrassment she felt, came up to Tom and grabbed him.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Why won't you

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mimuru was screaming
and Tom, who couldn't understand what was going on, was being jostled by his
girlfriend. Meanwhile, Shina and Karanti were sighing deeply.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the midst of all
this, Tima tapped Mimuru on the shoulder, calling out to her in a panicked
manner.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"M-Mimuru-san, if
you make so much nosiness, you'll cause trouble for the others......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What do you
want, Tima-san!? I'm in the middle of something important here-...... ah~"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mimuru, turning around
in agitation, looked in the direction to which Tima pointed and let out an
involuntary yelp.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A cluster of gazes
directed at her from the surroundings. All of them were clearly expressing
their dissatisfaction with Mimuru, as though saying [Be quiet!]. Originally,
this was a place where many students came to study by themselves. If one were
to raise one's voice here, one would naturally be reprimanded.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A-Ahahaha ......
S-Sorry."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mimuru let go of her
grip with a twitching smile on her face and quickly hid behind her lover to
escape the stares of those around her.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Tom, you sure
have a hard time, huh?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's fine. I'm
used to it."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tom smiled as he
stroked his lover's shrinking head with the back of his hand. Mimuru began
purring at the feel of Tom's hand caressing her head.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So, what were
you guys talking about with such an unusual line-up?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Once the protesting
stares from those around them had subsided, Mimuru leaned forward again and
pressed close to Shina and the others.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It was just a
coincidence that we ended up together. Why are you so curious?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, it's just
that my whiskers caught a whiff of something sweet and sour......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What the heck? In
the first place, the Cat-tailed Tribe doesn't have that kind of ability."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina once again cast
a suspicious glance at Mimuru, who was puffing out her chest while twitching
her whiskers as if to show off.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">On the other hand,
Somia was looking at the movement of Mimuru's whiskers with interest. She is a
cat lover by nature. Perhaps it is because she loves cute things that she is
attracted to such small gestures.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ehem, a maiden
in love is sensitive, you know? Tima-san, you're also a damsel in love, isn't
that right?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eeh~!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tima, who was suddenly
asked such a question, shouted in surprise. Remembering what she had said
previously, Tima's face turned bright red.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Huh? Am I wrong?
I thought I heard Mars-kun's name?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... You were
eavesdropping on us?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina's doubtful gaze
turned to accusatory. Mimuru smiled bitterly and let out a dry laugh,
"Hahaha.......".</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So, you were
indeed talking about Mars-kun, right!? I wonder how far you and Mars-kun have
gotten!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"H-How far you
ask......."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, have you
gone as far as making out, or are you still in the stage of flirting in the
same room? ...... Don't tell me you're still dawdling in the entrance!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Before the sermon
could begin, Mimuru forcefully pressed Tima to get to the bottom of it. It
could be said that her switch flip is as quick as ever. The corners of Shina's
eyes lifted up in a grimace.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tima, on the other
hand, turned to Somia, who sat next to her, as if asking for help. It was
undoubtedly that she could rely on an eleven-year-old girl, but this girl might
be able to help her if she had a strong core just like her sister. Tima had
such hopes......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, I'm kind of
curious, too!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eeh!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tima's hope was
abruptly busted by Somia herself. She leaned forward, her eyes shining just as
brightly as Mimuru's. The attendant, Mena, did not seem to stop Somia, but
rather happily watched the situation unfold.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I know it,
Somicchi will be curious about it as well."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes. I'd like to
hear about it for future reference......."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"F-Future?......
Isn't it a little too early for you, Somia-chan?......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Umm, I don't
know. Some of my classmates have kissed......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Since they were
Somia's classmates, they should be around 11 years old. Incidentally, Tima had
never even held hands with a man before, except with her father. Of course,
there was no way she could have had any experience with kissing.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Kiss, kiss?

a girl facing each other flashed in Tima's mind. Their gazes intersected. The
distance between them was so close that they could even feel each other's
breath. Soon their respective faces filled each other's field of vision, and eventually.......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A~u."</span></span></p>

much, Tima rolled her eyes while her face bright red.</span></span></p>

overheated as her head filled with pink scenes.</span></span></p>

who lost her mind and poked her on the cheek.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Meanwhile, seeing her
best friend's savagery, Shina looked at Somia while holding her temples.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"U-Umm,

to Ransa-chan, some of her friends are even already done it. For example,
Mary-chan, Kinea-chan, -......"</span></span></p>

fingers to count as she named several of her friends. One of her hands was not
enough, so she used both hands, and when it was still not enough, she folded it
back again. Seeing this, Shina's face twitched and she raised her voice.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"T-That's enough,

strangely popped into her shaken mind after hearing about the surprisingly
progressive love life of a younger generation.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't tell me,

both understand that we are in a position where we can't decide on a partner so
easily. It's a bit unfortunate though......"</span></span></p>

lips, Somia smiled a little sadly. She looked so mature that it was hard to
believe that she was an eleven-year-old girl.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If one thinks about
it, she is indeed the daughter of the Francilt family, just like Irisdina. She
must have a good sense of discretion in this regard.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina thought it was
only natural, but inwardly she felt a little sympathy for their family
situation. Shina, too, was in a position where she could not escape the
pressure of her surroundings when it came to her marriage partner.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Elves are a race whose
life span is among the longest on this continent, which makes it difficult for
them to produce offspring. Despite this, they lost their homeland in the great
invasion 20 years ago and suffered many casualties.</span></span></p>

haven and greatly reduced in number, the elves are in constant danger of
extinction. As a countermeasure, the elven elders encouraged marriage between
men and women of the right age who were able to bear children.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Naturally, Shina was
approached with marriage proposals as well. At the time, she had lost her
ability to use spirit magic, but it did not pose much of a problem for her to
leave behind some children.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But she turned it down
and instead came here to Arcazam. Behind her eyelids, she could still recall
the burning forest and her family lying on the ground. And the image of the
black demonic beast was etched into her memory.</span></span></p>

she leaned back in her chair.</span></span></p>

that a single individual can do to change his or her environment. Shina said
these words because she actually experienced this when she was a child.</span></span></p>

still able to smile peacefully. Mimuru looked at her best friend and muttered.</span></span></p>

a few moments ago. But now, she felt a warmth in her heart.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina knew that Somia
and Nozomu had gone on a date before, but only while she was helping at a candy
stall. She did not know that Somia kissed Nozomu afterward.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While Shina was
shocked by the new revelations, Karanti, who had been sitting next to her and
just listening to the conversation, suddenly spoke up.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Speaking of
which, you were also proposed to by Leader, remember?"</span></span></p>

I thought you were a modest person since you're an elf, but apparently, you're
quite aggressive, huh......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hold on,

from the side, Shina spontaneously turned her head toward Karanti, letting out
a flustered voice. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There she saw the wolf
tribe girl with an extremely dissatisfied expression on her face.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Of course, I
know. I know you don't really care about it, and I know the leader meant it as
a joke. Yeah, I know it very well."</span></span></p>

spilled over and flared up, Mimuru, who loves to play with fire, unleashed a
line that further fanned the flames.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh, by the way,
currently, Nozomu-kun and Irisdina-san are on a date in the forest together~~.
Just the two of them, alone in a place where no one can disturb them! I wonder
what they are doing right now~~"</span></span></p>

previous chest pangs were back again, and a streak of bulging veins formed on
Shina's forehead.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Mimuru, come

come, Shina grabbed her bad friend by the collar and tried to take her away
behind the bookshelf.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Somia, who was
standing by the elf girl's side without a care in the world, wore a slightly
complicated expression on her face.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"S-Shina. Don't
make that kind of face. You're ruining your beautiful face...... Spare me,
pretty please?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mimuru attempted to
make amends with a cramped smile on her face, but Shina cut her short. With
Shina's personality that usually restrained herself from various things, the
result of releasing the restraint was tremendous.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Shina-san, would
you like to use this?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What Somia took out
was a book as thick as a dictionary. It was the book Mimuru found for Tom.
Somia was quite merciless in casually handing over something that would make
the punishment more severe.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Alright, let me
borrow this for a second."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wha!? What are
you gonna do with that!? It will dent my head!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina, ignoring
Mimuru's desperate cries, took the book Somia offered her by holding it with
one hand. The sight of Shina's slender hand dragging a single person was so
disconcerting that one could hardly believe one's eyes, but at the same time,
it exuded a spine-tingling intimidation.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A-Anyone, please
save me!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Feeling her life in
danger, Mimuru desperately resisted, but it was all in vain. Shina, who usually
wielded a powerful bow, actually has a very strong grip. She could even crush
an apple in her hands with ease.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Naturally, she was not
even a bit fazed by the slight struggle.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A few seconds after
Shina took Mimuru away with a thin smile on her face and her figure disappeared
behind the shelves, there was a scream so loud that it shook the entire
library.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Incidentally, because
the scream was so loud that the windowpanes shook, Shina and the others
received a grand scolding from the librarians, and all of them had to be thrown
out of the library.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">†</span></span></p>

of the library, Shina made her way alone back to the girls' dormitory.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">People in the town
looked a little frightened when they saw her walking with a wrinkled forehead
and angry atmosphere, but her heart was so shaken that she didn't care about
such surrounding gazes.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Oh, by the

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her chest was
throbbing. As she turned her head to the side, her pearly cheeks puffed out
sullenly, she saw her own face reflected in the glass of a store window.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(What a

sigh as she saw herself looking like a young child having a tantrum.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She then entered a
back alley to escape the surrounding gazes. She hid herself behind a dimly lit
alleyway and leaned her back against the wall, where she felt a cool sensation
spreading across her back.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, absentmindedly
looking up at the sky in the narrow alleyway, she relaxed her body and slowly
closed her eyes.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Eventually, her body
gradually began to glow faintly. It was the glow of magic.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It wasn't very
praiseworthy to use magic on such a narrow alleyway. Sheena, who was usually an
earnest person, would not have done such a thing, but she couldn't help but be
concerned about those two in the forest.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While paying attention
to her surroundings, she increased her magical power.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A blue-colored magic
light leaked from her body.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Having temporarily
increased her magical power, she did not scatter it around her as she did when
she made the spirit contract, instead, she concentrated it on a point within
herself, the channel that she had opened through the previous contract magic.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Normally, this channel
would have disappeared on its own, but instead, she has been maintaining it by
pouring her own magical power into it regularly. When she thought about the
disappearance of this connection, she felt a sense of loss as if there was a
gaping hole in her heart.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A worn-out magical
channel. She gently and carefully unfolded it out as if she were handling a
precious treasure.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nn......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To be honest, it is
not a praiseworthy thing to connect a channel without the other party's
knowledge. Contract magic, which deeply connects different beings, can be very
dangerous depending on how it is used.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After the battle with
the [Cracked-Crown] Giant Centipede in the forest, she tried to connect this
magic channel again, but she restrained herself, thinking it was a bad thing to
do. But after he woke up and heard his past stories and anguish from his mouth,
and saw Irisdina walking with him today, she couldn't stop herself any longer.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What she felt beyond the
magic channel that was gradually opening up was the presence of Nozomu, whom
she was anxious to see.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Behind her closed
eyelids, her vision, which had been pitch-black, a small light drew nearer from
within the darkness.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When Shina saw this
light, the corners of her mouth relaxed. The guilt and frustration she had
previously felt began to disappear as if it were a lie.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shina's feelings were
stirred, and her magical power increased in response. And through her body, the
connection with Nozomu was further strengthened. Immediately afterward, the
small light exploded into a flash.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A gust of wind swept
over Shina's body. But she kept smiling and let the breeze wash over her entire
body.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At the same time, a
pale light that expanded simultaneously enveloped her body. She could feel
Nozomu's presence from all directions, and it was as if her whole self was
embraced in his arms.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Fufu......!"</span></span></p>

welled up naturally brought a smile to her lips. Eventually, with the sensation
of breaking through the clouds, her vision suddenly became clear. However, the
scene that jumped into her eyes made Shina let out an unintentional gasp.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah......."</span></span></p>

dark-haired girl was looking up at her, somewhat wistfully, as if pleading.</span></span></p>

about to express her feelings for him. Her outstretched hand touched his cheek.</span></span></p>

felt a moment ago suddenly disappeared, and instead, the heart-wrenching
sadness returned.</span></span></p>

her to come out of it, Nozomu offered cookies, her favorite treat before her

Shino's grave, which was illuminated by the sunlight. Then, he put his hand on
her grave and closed his eyes. Memories of his master flashed through his mind,

When Nozomu finished his silent prayer and stood up, Irisdina called out to him
in a slightly hurried tone.</span></span></p>

such a slight distance between them, the two of them stared at the sky above
the trees in the forest for a while.</span></span></p>

of the reasons is that my father strongly encouraged the establishment of
Solminati Academy. He also invested a considerable amount of money in it.
Besides, the culture of the aristocratic schools in my home country just
doesn't suit me."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Doesn't suit you?"</span></span></p>

they provide a certain level of education, but at the same time, it is a place

certain extent, but even so, more than 90% of the heirs of the family are men.
Even fewer women are willing to take over the reins of the family, not by chance,
but of their own volition. Almost none. That's why", Irisdina added,
"I was looked down upon quite bizarrely in my home country."</span></span></p>

different origins, a noble and a commoner. On top of that, they came from
different countries. It's only natural, but talking about it like this makes him
aware of it again.</span></span></p>

all he convey. There were many words that came to mind, but none of them felt
right, so he made his choice. What he received as a reply was only one word,

entered the room, he found Jihad, the master of the room, his assistant Inda,
and Anri, Nozomu's class homeroom teacher, in a discussion.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So~~. Will you

there is no better way to find out who he is. We have already notified all the

other person on our watch list?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"He has been

Nozomu's name, Jihad and Inda's eyes naturally narrowed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Feo is one of the
informants of the city's intelligence organization, the Starlight. After the
defeat of the [Cracked-Crown] Giant Centipede, he and Anri had reported to them
that Nozomu was a Dragon Slayer.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They were wary of
Nozomu Bountis. No, it was more like they were trying to discern. For this
reason, they had Feo report regularly about Nozomu's situation.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It would be impossible
not to be concerned about a Dragon Slayer, who had not appeared in several
hundred years.</span></span></p>

Anri, she smiled at him and gave a small nod. </span></span></p>

glance at her. To him, Anri was actually the one who had dragged him into this
troublesome situation, so he had a bit of a bad feeling about her.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, right. What
about Ken Notice? Are you going to summon him and question him? Concealing
abilities is against the school's rules, isn't it?"</span></span></p>

Notice's abilities were to be made public, it would inevitably draw attention
to Nozomu Bountis as well. As a result, there is a possibility that people will
find out about him being a Dragon Slayer, and thus, the whole thing will become
like a hot potato."</span></span></p>

level is the highest on the continent, and they are unrivaled in terms of
tactical warfare. The fact that it can escape even from such a group shows just
how out of the ordinary the beast is. At the same time, the extraordinary
nature of Nozomu's ability to defeat such a demonic beast is also apparent.</span></span></p>

Arcazam council is still focused on the Six Bad Omens and the Abyss Grief. So,
to avoid any confusion, we will keep Nozomu Bountis matter secret for
now."</span></span></p>

was also the matter of Abyss Grief. What about that one?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Abyss Grief. An
unidentified demonic beast that appeared before the Special Comprehensive
Exercise. It was defeated by Shina Juliel and Nozomu Bountis, and an
investigation was being conducted by the Gloaurum Institution regarding the
magic stone left behind by this beast.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The report has
also come in, but apart from its appearance, there seems to be nothing
different from an ordinary magic stone. It is currently being kept in a vault
under strict control. Hmm, it's about time."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What's
wrong?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There's a
council meeting coming up. It's probably about the Six Bad Omens and the Abyss
Grief that I just talked about."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The chair creaked and
Jihad stood up. Then, he let out a sigh that could not hide his exhaustion
...... and turned his gaze to Feo. Seeing his meaningful gaze, an unpleasant
sweat broke out on Feo's back.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Feo-kun, I still
have a few concerns about the previous case. I'd like you to look into
it."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Why do I
have a feeling this is going to be troublesome?"</span></span></p>

serious. I just need you to go into the forest for a little while."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a wicked smile,
Jihad tapped Feo on the shoulder. Feo's face twitched under the pressure of the
smile directed at him by the veteran hero.</span></span></p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>‡</strong></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In a dimly lit room,
two people are facing each other.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">One is a young man
with blond hair. He looks somewhat restless and bites his nails as he walks
back and forth.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The other is hidden in
the shadows. Without moving an inch, it stares at the young man in front of it,
who is revealing his frustration.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Why don't you
calm down a little?</span></span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There's no way I
can calm down! What the hell is that monster!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The blonde-haired
young man, Ken Notice, yelled out wildly at the words coming from the shadows.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It shouldn't have been
possible. He was sure he could kill him. That obstacle. The childhood friend
who had always stood by her side and monopolized her gaze.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But the result was
totally unexpected. That abominable childhood friend had defeated the demonic
beast that no human could ever defeat.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The power he was
radiating at that time was unimaginable.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was definitely the
power of a spirit, a dragon of the highest order. It is a forbidden power that
humans should never be able to control.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His identity is
shaken. Ken's mind was in turmoil like a storm because of his attachment to the
power that was the reason for being by her side. Surprise led to a sense of
crisis, further stirring his frustration.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">How the hell
could he possess that kind of power!? When and how......!?</span></span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Quick, we have
to get rid of that guy as soon as possible. He's dangerous......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then Ken finally noticed
the questioning glances coming from the shadows.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Why did you
move on your own? Why did you do it in such a conspicuous way?</span></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The intense gaze that
carried reproach in it caused Ken's eyes to widen in anger and frustration.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-It's
necessary, you know!? Besides, I'm sure you had your own worries about getting
rid of that demonic beast......!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The intimidating gaze
that was directed at him loosened slightly. That means Ken's words had some
truth to them.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Anyway, I need
your help to get rid of him one more time."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At Ken's words, the
shadow's gaze intensified again. That gaze said:</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If you want to
get rid of him, just do it. I've already handed over my lackey. But this is the
last time I will close my eyes.</span></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken gulped upon
receiving that piercing gaze. It was only because of this person's backing that
he had been able to carry out various sabotage schemes.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, that will
end. Confronted with this fact, Ken tried to say something, but the inorganic
gaze that was directed at him silenced him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">If you
understand, then go home</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">. Ken bit his lip upon hearing these words and turned
his back to leave the place. There was a dangerous glint in his eyes.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The shadow, having
seen him leave, snorted in dismay. <i>This
one is beyond help. His mentality is weaker than expected. But it also brought
unexpected good news.</i></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The shadow held up his
hand into the depths of darkness. A light circled in the air, creating a film
of light that shone like a mirror. A young man was reflected there.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For the first
time in hundreds of years, a Dragon Slayer had appeared. The second coming of a
complete legend, different from the failures of that country.</span></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And, that
power. Without a doubt, it belonged to that Abhorrence Dragon, which was the
most heretical among the mightiest spirit species.</span></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Furthermore,
in pursuit of this Abhorrent Dragon, even its greatest adversary has come to
this Arcazam.</span></span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The fateful hour
is approaching."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After erasing Nozomu's
projected image, the shadow turned its eyes to a corner of the room that was
shrouded in darkness.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There, a lone raven
stood as if waiting for the shadow's command.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The shadow waved its
hand as if commanding it, and then the raven melted into the shadow and
disappeared. After witnessing this, the shadow also left the room.</span></span></p>
