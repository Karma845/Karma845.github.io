<h2>Prologue</h2>


<p>Suddenly, I have a precious treasure. It’s an existence that I absolutely don’t want to let go of, and no matter what happens in the future, I want to protect it. Well, calling it a treasure might be wrong. It’s complicated… calling a precious person a treasure might be fine, but when it’s not an object but a person, I wonder if expressing it that way is appropriate.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun?”</p>



<p>While I was lost in thought, she, Ayana, approached me. Ayana is the main heroine of this world, deviating from the original plot and choosing to walk forward with me.</p>



<p>“…Ah~… that’s right.”</p>



<p>As I spoke, she stared at me, waiting for the words that followed.</p>



<p>“…Ayana, you’re cute—unbelievably cute. No matter how many times I say it, it’s not enough. You’re so cute that it’s unbearable.”</p>



<p>I didn’t need to use vague or misleading words between us. That’s why I conveyed my feelings as they were. Ayana blushed visibly and lowered her gaze in response.</p>



<p>I suppressed the urge to say that she’s even cuter like this, and continued my thoughts.</p>




<p>(Several days have passed since then. It’s quite nostalgic.)</p>



<p>Walking forward together, becoming happy together… declaring that we will be happy together. Even though only a few days have passed since that declaration, it feels like months have gone by for me. </p>



<p>Perhaps it’s because, after that incident, Ayana’s presence has become even closer to me.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>Shu, my childhood friend and the protagonist of this world, had some resentment towards us, but since then, there has been no contact, whether at school or elsewhere. He seemed unable to accept Ayana moving away.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun…?”</p>



<p>For both me and Ayana, Shu is, in a sense, a person with whom we have a connection. Despite parting ways, there is still a lingering feeling of wanting to find a common ground and share a laugh.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun!!”</p>



<p>“Yes!?”</p>




<p>With a loud voice, I was pushed, and I fell onto the cushion. Straddling my hips and looking down at me, Ayana puffed up her cheeks. Perhaps, she was trying to get my attention, and I was too engrossed in my thoughts to notice?</p>



<p>“Mou, Towa-kun! I’ve been calling you so many times, respond!”</p>



<p>“Ahaha… sorry, sorry.”</p>



<p>My wry smile didn’t please her, and Ayana continued with her puffed-up expression. But does she realize? Probably, what Ayana wants to convey is a protest against being ignored, but the more she shows that expression, the more I want to tease her.</p>



<p>Am I a sadist? I don’t think so, but while thinking that, I patted her head.</p>



<p>“There ~ there~.”</p>



<p>“Treating people like animals… Fumyaa♪”</p>



<p>At the moment of petting, she showed signs of resistance, but Ayana let out a cat-like, affectionate voice and leaned into it. Her black hair fluttered, and the scent of shampoo after a bath tickled my nose. Above all, the feeling of Ayana’s ample chest pressing against me was wonderful.</p>



<p>(…I truly feel it from the bottom of my heart, that I’m happy.)</p>




<p>My hand that strokes Ayana’s head continues, and the other hand wraps around her back. I won’t let her go, even if she says she wants to. </p>



<p>With such slightly weighty thoughts in my mind, I continued to embrace Ayana, the beloved existence.</p>



<p>“I love Towa-kun’s hand that strokes me♪”</p>



<p>“Not just in front of me anymore… it might not be the case, but I love when you openly rely on me like this.”</p>



<p>Generally, in public… well, there were instances of her subtly leaning against me or tapping her toes under the table, but still, openly relying on me like this only happened when we were alone.</p>


<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/image-05.jpg"/>


<p>(…I truly feel it from the bottom of my heart, that I’m happy.)</p>



<p>Now that Ayana and I are officially in a relationship, I think we’ll probably start being affectionate in public as well. Well, let’s see how things go.</p>



<p>“It’s wonderful to be able to expose my true self only in front of Towa-kun. But… to be honest, confessing that is already impossible.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>




<p>“Because, isn’t it true? The person I’ve liked for so long… the person I’ve pledged to and grown even fonder of is right in front of me. No matter if it’s in public, I can’t resist.”</p>



<p>“…Geez, you’re too cute.”</p>



<p>If I were allowed, I would open the window wide and shout, “Ayana is the best!” As I was thinking about such things, Ayana’s face moved right in front of me.</p>



<p>Blushing, she stared at me and then kissed me with a gentle lip sound. In response, I kissed her back.</p>



<p>“Chu…”</p>



<p>The kisses from both of us didn’t stop. Even when we separated for a moment to catch our breath, we would naturally bring our faces closer again, and the kisses would resume. </p>



<p>It wouldn’t end with just cute kisses where our lips touched; it would soon escalate into deep kisses, intertwining our tongues.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun♡”</p>



<p>With moist eyes, flushed cheeks, and an excited expression, Ayana calling my name is a sign from her. I changed my position, sat up, and pulled Ayana into my arms from behind.</p>




<p>Of course, it wouldn’t end with just hugging her with my arms.</p>



<p>While caressing Ayana with love, I nestled my face into her neck, and despite her ticklish reaction, I continued without minding.</p>



<p>“Mm… Ha♪”</p>



<p>Ayana’s alluring sighs spilled out, heightening my excitement.</p>



<p>The rise in body temperature, felt only when touching each other, affected Ayana as well. With her face turned back, she thrust her lips forward as if begging for more kisses.</p>



<p>(…Ayana is too er*tic.)</p>



<p>Ayana being sensual is not a new thing, but still, I can’t help but think about it. </p>



<p>She’s usually pure and, even though she says she shows her true self only in front of me, she’s still a modest girl… </p>



<p>That’s why, as we approach the act, Ayana’s demeanor quickly deviates from her usual self.</p>




<p>“Towa-kun… I can’t hold back anymore.”</p>



<p>Not only with eyes filled with tears but also with words, Ayana appeals to me… but at this moment, I was quite off guard.</p>



<p>Why? Because the door to the room opened with a loud bang.</p>



<p>“Towa~! I’m home~!”</p>



<p>My mom, in a pretty high-spirited mood, peeked in. The so-called parent intrusion was happening right before our eyes. However, to be fair, my mom shouldn’t have been coming home from work at this time.</p>



<p>“Ah, aah…uhm…”</p>



<p>Even Ayana, who is usually good at handling situations, seems to struggle when faced with such circumstances.</p>



<p>“……………”</p>



<p>Without saying anything, my mom just stared at us. Hugging Ayana from behind, my face turning red, and Ayana’s clothes slightly undone… my mom continued to gaze at us. Then, she smiled elegantly and spoke.</p>




<p>“Ara ara, I’m sorry~♪ I’ll be taking a bath now, so take your time~”</p>



<p>Waving her hand lightly, my mom disappeared. Her blushing face wasn’t because she felt embarrassed seeing us; it was probably due to having consumed quite a bit of alcohol. </p>



<p>Well, it’s impossible for my mom to feel embarrassed about such things at this point.</p>



<p>After staring at the door in bewilderment for a while, Ayana and I discreetly moved away from each other and began to gaze at each other.</p>



<p>“Uhm… I guess it’s not just that we didn’t lock the door, but we were so engrossed that we didn’t even hear her footsteps, huh?”</p>



<p>“Yes, um… ugh, it’s really embarrassing.”</p>



<p>Even Ayana, who was full of energy just a moment ago, blushed with embarrassment and lowered her gaze.</p>



<p>“Let’s fix this,”</p>



<p>I stood up and walked towards the door, making sure to lock it securely. Gently embracing Ayana, who was squirming in embarrassment, I whispered softly in her ear.</p>




<p>“What do you think? Should we take a moment to calm down and then continue?”</p>



<p>In response to my question, Ayana nodded.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default" />



<p>“…Fue”</p>



<p>After finishing our activities as a couple, I gazed at the starry sky through the window. Ayana, now sleeping naked on the bed, embraced the blanket, and the disarray we had just experienced seemed to be concealed, as if it were a lie.</p>



<p>[I feel so fulfilled… I never thought my mindset could change this much.] </p>



<p>Ayana had said. If she feels that way about our interactions, it makes me genuinely happy.</p>



<p>“But well, it was a bit embarrassing when my mom peeked in.”</p>



<p>Recalling the moment when my mom’s face appeared, it wasn’t just because we were too engrossed, but we also forgot to be cautious. Maybe we should have been more prepared for any situation, even though it’s usually safe when my mom isn’t around or when she’s deep asleep after drinking.</p>



<p>“But… even if she didn’t peek, would it have been okay?”</p>




<p>Concerns about sound leakage… well, I usually pay attention to that, and besides, my mom only drinks and falls into a deep sleep when she’s not around. Perhaps worrying about it is futile.</p>



<p>“….Haha, having these thoughts might be a sign of peace of mind.”</p>



<p>Muttering that, I smiled wryly and shifted my gaze back to Ayana.</p>



<p>At times like this, Ayana often secretly wakes up and silently watches me. But tonight, she seems to be sleeping peacefully, exposing her cute sleeping face without any defenses. In fact, she even has a grin, as if she’s having a pleasant dream.</p>



<p>“Any face looks cute, it’s almost cheating… Well, my current face is handsome enough, though.”</p>



<p>This is not a narcissistic statement, but a fact given that I was reincarnated. I would never say to others, “I’m handsome, don’t you think?” or anything like that.</p>



<p>“Well~, I should probably get some sleep too…”</p>



<p>Although I said that, I still didn’t feel like sleeping. I continued to gaze at Ayana, pondering something.</p>



<p>It relates to Ayana’s current situation. Since the day we parted ways with Shu, Ayana hasn’t been returning home much. She mostly spends her nights at my house.</p>




<p>Neither my mom nor I have raised any objections to this, and my mom even seems pleased with her presence. However, the fact remains that Ayana’s relationship with her actual mother, Seina-san, is still strained.</p>



<p>“Hm~m…”</p>



<p>I’ve said it multiple times, but this world is an erotic game world, and the originally intended future was altered by my actions. Although the fact that Ayana distanced herself from Shu remains unchanged, I was able to protect the part of Ayana’s heart I wanted to protect – undoubtedly the result I desired.</p>



<p>“But because of that… I want to do something about the other aspects too.”</p>



<p>In that regard, I want to somehow resolve the friction with Seina-san. I know she dislikes me, but since she’s Ayana’s mother, it would be better to have a good relationship. More than that, because it’s about Ayana, I absolutely want to resolve it.</p>



<p>“To achieve that… I wonder what I should do.” </p>



<p>How to make someone who dislikes you start accepting you… no, in this case, how to be acknowledged by them? It’s probably the same thing, but regardless, I want to do something about it.</p>



<p>“….Fue… oh, it’s already this late.”</p>



<p>Seems like I’ve been lost in thought for quite a while, and sleepiness has kicked in. After finishing my business in the bathroom before bedtime, I let out a big yawn and got into the bed where Ayana was sleeping.</p>




<p>“Towa… kun…”</p>



<p>Ayana greeted me with cute sleep-talk. Seeing the various sides of her just today, I truly find Ayana adorable, and no matter what happens, I wish to be with her – to face the future together and be happy.</p>



<p>(As a person living in this world, and as a man who vowed to protect Ayana, I have to do my best.)</p>



<p>While contemplating this, Ayana mumbled something.</p>



<p>“Of course……”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“Suu…Suu…”</p>



<p>Her current murmurings…?</p>



<p>Glancing at her sleeping soundly beside me, I realized she’s still asleep and, although it’s a bit embarrassing to say, there’s a bit of drool. Well, her being this defenseless is quite unusual, isn’t it?</p>




<p>“Tomorrow morning, please wake up before me and wipe it off.”</p>



<p>Saying that, I closed my eyes, and Ayana immediately snuggled up to me. It seems she unconsciously wants to use my clothes to wipe off her drool.</p>



<p>With a sigh, I gently patted her head, and finally, I drifted off to sleep.</p>



<p>Since Ayana and I officially became a couple, it’s only been a few days, but there are several obstacles – more like boulders – rolling around us. Let’s deal with each one step by step. No matter how much time it takes. Slowly and steadily, let’s clean up this mess.</p>
