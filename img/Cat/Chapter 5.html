<h3>Chapter 5</h3>


<p>That was the moment that had been bound to come.</p>



<p>“It’s because of you that Ayana with me anymore…! It’s because of you… because of you!”</p>



<p>I still retain my memories as Towa, and within those memories, I had never seen him… Shu, tainted with such hatred.</p>



<p>Yet now, he’s glaring at me as though I were his parent’s enemy.</p>



<p>(Here it comes… but it’s the perfect moment.)</p>



<p>I simply meet his gaze head-on, staring back at him.</p>



<p>I won’t run or hide — so, Shu, shall we have a little chat?</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“Hey, have you noticed lately how happy Otonashi-san seems?”</p>




<p>“What, are you implying something?”</p>



<p>“Don’t aim at me! Get rid of that murderous intent!”</p>



<p>Murderous aura? What is he, a seasoned warrior or something? Ignoring his sudden nonsensical remark, I concentrate on ridding myself of bodily impurities — that is, I need to use the restroom.</p>



<p>“…Fuee”</p>



<p>After a while, I leave the restroom feeling refreshed.</p>



<p>Walking alongside me is Aisaka, who just followed me to the restroom… but I’m curious why he thought that way about Ayana.</p>



<p>“So, why did you think of Ayana like that?”</p>



<p>Before entering the classroom, I stop and lean against the wall, asking him.</p>



<p>“Well, it’s not like I was staring or anything. Otonashi-san being by Yukshiro’s side and smiling isn’t out of the ordinary, but this week, she seemed to be smiling a lot more, and she looked happier than ever before.”</p>




<p>“I see…”</p>



<p>“…I feel like I shouldn’t have mentioned it, but it just slipped out.”</p>



<p>“No, no need to apologize. But I see… she seemed that way, huh?”</p>



<p>“Based on that…?”</p>



<p>I’m not sure if I’m right since I’m not going to confirm it with Ayana right away, but I’m curious about why he thought that way.</p>



<p>After all, I tend to notice when Ayana’s mood is better than usual even before others do.</p>



<p>“Well, there was something. For both me and Ayana, a problem we’d been wanting to resolve for a while finally got resolved.”</p>



<p>That’s right — it’s about our family issue.</p>



<p>Several days have passed since then, and I’ve seen Mom talking to Seina-san on the phone at night, confirming that what happened wasn’t a dream or an illusion.</p>




<p>“I can’t go into details, but everything was evidence of Ayana’s smile.”</p>



<p>I grin and convey that to him.</p>



<p>“I see… well, then I won’t ask for details! If Yukishiro and Otonashi-san are happy, as a friend, I’m happy too!”</p>



<p>This guy… he really is a good person.</p>



<p>I’ve heard rumors that he’s expected to be the next captain of the baseball team, and Mari was talking so happily about Aisaka… he’s truly a great guy.</p>



<p>“Aisaka, you are a good guy, huh?”</p>



<p>“Why are you suddenly saying that?”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about it. And by the way, ‘why are you suddenly saying that’ is my line, you know? Lately, you’ve been saying cheesy lines out of nowhere.”</p>



<p>“Eh? Is that so…?”</p>




<p>Yep, not being aware of it makes it even more troublesome.</p>



<p>I smiled wryly as I watched Aisaka scratch his head, knowing it would probably feel rough due to his few millimeters of hair.</p>



<p>(But I have things to discuss with Ayana.)</p>



<p>This isn’t a topic I should be poking at. Shu probably still has feelings for Ayana, and it’s not something to address immediately. But if there were any developments, Aisaka, who’s usually very transparent, wouldn’t stay unchanged. So, I’ll just enjoy watching from a distance.</p>



<p>“Hey, why are you grinning like that?”</p>



<p>“I was thinking about you.”</p>



<p>“…Eh?”</p>



<p>“Just kidding.”</p>



<p>If he actually reacted strangely to that, I’d be surprised. Aisaka walked into the classroom with me, and Ayana naturally came to my side.</p>




<p>“Welcome back, Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“I’m back, Ayana.”</p>



<p>“Ooh, it’s like a conversation between a married couple!”</p>



<p>“We are a couple, you know?”</p>



<p>Oh, looks like Aisaka’s comment triggered something weird in Ayana. Aisaka glanced at me, but I decided to just watch how things unfold.</p>



<p>“Aisaka-kun, as well as my friends, I’ve kept this a secret, but Towa-kun and I got married.”</p>



<p>“Eh? Otonashi-san? What are you saying—”</p>



<p>“Sorry, it’s a bit too much to say high school students got married, so I shouldn’t have… Oh, I’m sorry! I said it out of happiness.”</p>



<p>“Eh…? Eh…?”</p>




<p>Hmm? What’s with this atmosphere?</p>



<p>By the way, this absurd conversation was only happening between us, and it was obviously unheard by our classmates amidst the noise. Of course, Ayana had calculated that, but what’s going on?</p>



<p>(Ayana’s joking… but Aisaka’s reaction…)</p>



<p>Is Aisaka being forcefully misled by this absurd lie?</p>



<p>Ayana seems completely natural and confident… Perhaps because of that, Aisaka seems to believe it, despite it being obviously impossible… Foolish.</p>



<p>“Look, there’s already a ring on this finger.”</p>



<p>Ayana shows her finger —– naturally, nothing is fitted on that finger.</p>



<p>“There’s… nothing there?”</p>



<p>“Eh… Can’t you see it? This ring is said to be invisible to those with impure hearts… Could it be, Aisaka-kun?”</p>




<p>“Me? Am I like that!?”</p>



<p>Fool… Truly a fool.</p>



<p>Well, I didn’t expect Ayana to make such a joke… No, the fact that Ayana can make such a joke is proof of her exceptionally good mood.</p>



<p>“Uhm… Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>I felt a meaning in Ayana’s gaze, so I nodded in response.</p>



<p>Aisaka muttered, looking at me, “Is that so?” Then, hesitantly, he made a suggestion.</p>



<p>“Um… Is it okay if I touch Otonashi-san’s hand?”</p>



<p>“Yes, feel free.”</p>



<p>Aisaka cautiously touched Ayana’s ring finger… where she had indicated earlier. He seemed careful not to be rude to the opposite sex, and since Ayana allowed it herself, she didn’t seem uncomfortable at all.</p>


<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/image-10.jpg"/>


<p>“….Oi, Yukishiro.”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“It’s there… I can definitely feel the sensation of a ring!”</p>



<p>Okay, this guy is seriously a fool.</p>



<p>After that conversation, it seemed like Ayana stopped teasing Aisaka, but she couldn’t hold back her laughter at Aisaka’s reaction.</p>



<p>“Fufu….Ahaha! Sorry, Aisaka-kun. Everything we said was just a lie.”</p>



<p>“No it is real! You are not lying right? I can feel the sensation of the ring!”</p>



<p>“Aisaka-kun? Are you sleep-deprived or something?”</p>



<p>Even though Ayana started it, she seemed worried now. Aisaka seemed to genuinely believe it, and while I thought he was just being foolish, it was surprising how he could be so easily convinced by the atmosphere alone. Maybe Ayana could work wonders in that field?</p>




<p>“Damn it! I totally fell for it…”</p>



<p>“I’m really sorry. I never thought you’d believe me so much.”</p>



<p>Rather than being stupid, I think he should be a bit more skeptical. But anyway… seeing such an unlikely interaction in the morning left me a bit tired.</p>



<p>Afterwards, lunch break arrived quickly. After finishing lunch with Ayana and saying goodbye, I left the classroom.</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>At that moment, it seemed like Shu also left the classroom, following behind me.</p>



<p>Now… my original intention was to go to the bathroom, but it might be awkward if Shu also needs to go, right?</p>



<p>Thinking that, I decided to skip the bathroom for now, but Shu continued to follow me.</p>



<p>…Eh? Does he have something to say to me?</p>




<p>If that’s the case, it’s a good opportunity—of course, he might just have something else to do ahead, but I resisted the urge to go to the bathroom and headed to the rooftop, where no one else should be at this time.</p>



<p>Shu followed me there, but he remained silent, staring down. Frankly, it was quite eerie.</p>



<p>And then, after a few seconds, maybe tens of seconds, passed…</p>



<p>He finally lifted his head, glaring at me, and slowly closed the distance between us.</p>



<p>(There’s a fence behind me, but it’s a dead end.)</p>



<p>There are fences around the rooftop for safety, and from what I’ve seen of this school’s history, there haven’t been any unfortunate accidents of someone falling from the rooftop. That’s quite reassuring… but I couldn’t help but imagine it.</p>



<p>Currently, the relationship between Shu and me is catastrophically bad, and I am in a position where I have inadvertently taken away Shu’s childhood friend, whom he liked.</p>



<p>So, I thought he might resent me, and I couldn’t help but think of being pushed over the edge and falling headfirst to the ground.</p>



<p>(Well… that’s just needless worry.)</p>




<p>But there was no need for such concerns.</p>



<p>While Shu did indeed approach me while glaring, he stopped at a certain distance.</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>The silence between us continued.</p>



<p>Since it’s a waste of time to stay silent, just as I was about to start a conversation from my end… that’s when Shu spoke up.</p>



<p>“Why… why did you lie?”</p>



<p>“Lie?”</p>



<p>As I asked back honestly, Shu’s glare intensified.</p>




<p>“You said you were going to support my relationship with Ayana! Then why are you dating her!?”</p>



<p>“…….”</p>



<p>When Shu spoke up, I sighed, thinking it would be about that.</p>



<p>It seemed like my reaction didn’t sit well with him, as Shu took a step towards me. In response, I returned his gaze with a stern expression and spoke.</p>



<p>“I already apologized for that over the phone. I knew all along that you liked Ayana, and I remember you nodding in the hospital room when I didn’t give an answer. But I also liked Ayana… So I decided to convey my feelings to her and show my determination to walk together towards the future.”</p>



<p>These kinds of situations are troublesome even when the relationship isn’t completely shattered. When there are three childhood friends, two boys and one girl, if their feelings collide, there will inevitably be an unrequited presence… Ayana ended up with me, and it was fate that Shu didn’t. It’s easy to put into words, but it’s really complicated.</p>



<p>“What are you talking about… I liked Ayana too! We’ve always been together… If I had confessed first, Ayana would have…”</p>



<p>“Would she have nodded in agreement?”</p>



<p>“…”</p>




<p>Shu bit his lip and looked down, as if recalling everything. He acted after remembering everything, and that’s why he understood Ayana’s feelings… I also understood my own feelings and chose this path because I wanted to protect Ayana and sincerely wanted to be with her. The words I conveyed to her about being happy together were not about giving one or the other, but about supporting each other and giving happiness to each other.</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>Well, I thought about various things, but Shu’s words bothered me a bit. Not because of Shu’s lingering feelings for Ayana, but because he prioritized only himself without considering Ayana’s feelings. I don’t think I’m absolutely right, even if I think I am. My thoughts might be questioned by others. But even so, I decided to convey harsh words to Shu. Maybe the crack in our relationship would deepen to the point where it would be irreparable, but I couldn’t stop anymore.</p>



<p>“Shu, you’ll never make Ayana happy.”</p>



<p>I told him clearly, not just about Ayana’s essence, but also about how he didn’t try to understand her feelings and only prioritized himself.</p>



<p>Shu seemed stunned by my words for a moment, but then quickly regained himself and retorted.</p>



<p>“How do you know that!? I love Ayana more than you do! I’ve always been by her side! I can make her happier than you can!”</p>



<p>Shu continued to shout that he loved Ayana, as if he were stubbornly molding clay.</p>



<p>“It’s because of you that Ayana is gone…! It’s your fault… it’s all your fault!”</p>




<p>“…Haa”</p>



<p>Once again, a sigh escaped me.</p>



<p>Shu, do you realize it? You definitely love Ayana from the bottom of your heart, but your words don’t consider Ayana at all… It’s all about yourself.</p>



<p>“I can make her happier than you can…huh”</p>



<p>“—-What did you just mumble—–“</p>



<p>“Cut it out already!”</p>



<p>Something inside me snapped. While I’ve had strong emotions towards Shu before, this might be the first time I’ve felt such anger.</p>



<p>“All you’ve been doing is talking about yourself! You don’t consider Ayana’s feelings at all… Do you think your own happiness is Ayana’s happiness!? Stop being so selfish!”</p>



<p>Without giving Shu a chance to interject, I continued to vent my frustration.</p>




<p>I don’t think Shu had ever seen me show so much emotion. I don’t remember that at all either…… so maybe that’s why Shu was speechless.</p>



<p>I let out a breath, my shoulders heaving from speaking without pause. Shu shook his head and managed to squeeze out a few words with slight resistance.</p>



<p>“Then… Then do you really think you can make Ayana happy!?”</p>



<p>In response to his question, I nodded without any hesitation.</p>



<p>“Of course. I’m determined to make Ayana happy… Saying it like that might sound arrogant, but I’m prepared to do whatever it takes.”</p>



<p>And I will make her happy by my side… That’s my true intention.</p>



<p>Even though we’ve resolved several issues, I can’t predict what the future holds… Only a god would know that.</p>



<p>But even so, what does it matter?</p>



<p>Ayana and I will support each other, face forward together no matter what happens… Trusting each other, we will undoubtedly find happiness together. That’s our determination.</p>




<p>“……”</p>



<p>Shu seemed at a loss for words, bowing his head without moving.</p>



<p>…I knew I would eventually have to talk to Shu, but after hearing his words, I couldn’t help but say everything I wanted to say. But I have no regrets… It needed to be said.</p>



<p>“…Lunchtime is almost over, huh?”</p>



<p>I glanced at my phone to check the time. There were only ten minutes left until class started.</p>



<p>Seeing Shu in front of me like this, it seemed like our conversation was over… As I passed by him to return to the classroom, I muttered under my breath.</p>



<p>“Don’t be late for class.”</p>



<p>Even though I knew it, Shu didn’t say anything in response.</p>



<p>I’ve said everything I wanted to say to him, even though it made me lose my temper. But I don’t regret it… It had to be said.</p>




<p>“…Iori?”</p>



<p>Iori… the Student Council President was standing there, leaning against the wall with her arms crossed.</p>



<p>Why is she here…? It’s a natural question to ask, but did she overhear our conversation…?</p>



<p>“Hello, Yukishiro-kun.”</p>



<p>“Ah, hi.”</p>



<p>Her demeanor seemed… normal as usual.</p>



<p>She glanced briefly at the staircase I had descended from and then spoke up.</p>



<p>“I didn’t mean to eavesdrop. I just happened to see you two when I was on my way back from the restroom.”</p>



<p>“…So you heard?”</p>




<p>“Yes… I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>“No need to apologize.”</p>



<p>If I were in her shoes, I’d probably be curious too… Besides, she’s someone I know, so I don’t feel uncomfortable about it.</p>



<p>And since she knows, I decided to let her know I’m not bothered by it, which made Iori smile in relief.</p>



<p>“You’re amazing, Yukishiro-kun. To have such a clear vision of the future and to firmly hold your own opinions. Your words about making Ayana happy really resonated with me.”</p>



<p>“My words resonated with you?”</p>



<p>“It’s not a big deal, really. But, I have to admit, as a woman, it made my heart skip a beat.”</p>



<p>“…Is that so.”</p>



<p>I averted my gaze in response to her unexpected wink.</p>




<p>I’m used to seeing Ayana as the beautiful girl she is, but even so, I’d prefer not to have this kind of interaction in such close proximity… It made my heart race.</p>



<p>“It’s a wonderful feeling to be thought of that way. Please take good care of Ayana, okay?”</p>



<p>“Even if you didn’t say it, I know.”</p>



<p>“Fufu♪”</p>



<p>Of course, that’s just natural, without anyone needing to say it. Even as we talk, Iori seems to be glancing at the stairs from time to time, clearly conscious… No, worried about Shu.</p>



<p>“You’re worried about Shu, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>“…Yes, even though I thought his behavior was pitiful. Seeing him continue to be dragged down by thinking of Ayana… The time we spent together hasn’t disappeared.”</p>



<p>Iori just let out a sorrowful sigh.</p>



<p>We remained in awkward silence for a while, and perhaps to change the atmosphere, Iori chuckled softly.</p>




<p>“I’m sorry for making it awkward. Lunchtime is almost over, so shall we head back to the classroom?”</p>



<p>“Yes, you’re right. Oh, by the way…”</p>



<p>“Something wrong?”</p>



<p>What I’m going to say from now on can be said to be nothing to worry about since the game situation has changed… so it’s just meddling.</p>



<p>“President, you are going to university, right?”</p>



<p>“What’s this sudden talk about universities?”</p>



<p>“Well, um… I heard that there are some shady clubs at universities. So I just wanted to tell you to be careful.”</p>



<p>Even though it may not happen exactly as in the game’s scenario, it’s not uncommon to hear about shady clubs or those with ulterior motives in real life… Huh, why are you looking at me with wide eyes?</p>



<p>“Um…”</p>




<p>“…I thought it was sudden to bring up university talk, but I didn’t expect you to worry about that.”</p>



<p>Well, I’m well aware that it would be surprising to suddenly hear such things from Iori, and I understand that… Even if it’s not the best way to be reminded of the game’s setting.</p>



<p>But it’s understandable to worry.</p>



<p>“Fu~fu~. I appreciate your concern, but I’m not the type of woman to sell herself short, and I think I’m cautious enough about that sort of thing.”</p>



<p>She sounded confident, but her confidence only made me worry more.</p>



<p>After all, you… You’re actually really weak against alcohol… And without any doubt, you entered a sketchy club without any suspicion, all because of Ayana’s guidance and schemes…</p>



<p>Unaware of what I’m thinking, Iori continued speaking proudly.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, I’m not that weak of a woman!”</p>



<p>She chuckled softly, sounding very reliable… I mean, no way!</p>




<p>Her high-spirited and confident demeanor, unlike her usual cool self, was refreshing and cute, but I couldn’t possibly reassure her with how much she’s raising flags.</p>



<p>“…You seem unsatisfied.”</p>



<p>“No…”</p>



<p>I instinctively looked away from Iori, but does that mean I’ve acknowledged it?</p>



<p>I know it’s wrong to confuse the game with reality… But with the image of her enjoying herself still lingering in my mind, her overly confident face makes me worry.</p>



<p>“Yukishiro-kun?”</p>



<p>“…Ha!?”</p>



<p>“You seemed lost in thought.”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry!”</p>




<p>Oops, it seems I got lost in thought.</p>



<p>Before we knew it, it was almost time for class to start again, so we all headed back to our respective classrooms.</p>



<p>“Yukishiro-kun.”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>“I’ve come to a decision about Shu…”</p>



<p>“…Yes?”</p>



<p>“And thank you for your concern. Even though I think I’ll be fine, unexpected irregularities can happen in the world. Your words weren’t just advice, but a reminder to be cautious of what could actually happen. I’ll definitely take them to heart.”</p>



<p>With that, Iori walked away.</p>



<p>“I never expected her to say something like that…”</p>




<p>The things I wanted her to be cautious of… Even though she didn’t seem to take them seriously, why did she say that at the end?</p>



<p>“Hmm… I can’t figure it out. Anyway, I need to use the restroom! I better hurry!”</p>



<p>I really don’t want to be scolded by the teacher for being late to class.</p>



<p>…But speaking of which, Shu still hasn’t come down from the rooftop, has he? I felt a slight unease, but in the end, Shu returned just before class started, so I felt relieved about that.</p>



<p>And so, after enduring the sleepy afternoon classes, the much-awaited afterschool finally arrived.</p>



<p>“Yukishiro.”</p>



<p>“Yeah? What’s up, Aisaka?”</p>



<p>After the closing ceremony, as soon as the teacher left the classroom, Aisaka approached me.</p>



<p>Usually, he’d head straight to club activities after school, so it’s rare for him to approach me like this… Or rather, it’s rare for him to approach me at all?</p>




<p>“Actually, the club activities got canceled today. I was thinking of hanging out somewhere with you, if you’re interested…”</p>



<p>“Oh, really? It’s rare for club activities to be canceled like this.”</p>



<p>Come to think of it, they did mention something about workers coming in to do some work on the field during the morning assembly… Maybe that’s why.</p>



<p>Normally, I’d spend the afterschool hours with Ayana all the time.</p>



<p>I haven’t had many opportunities to hang out with Aisaka after school due to his busy schedule with club activities… Hmm, what should I do?</p>



<p>“Towa-kun, if you want to hang out with Aisaka-kun, you don’t need to hold back.”</p>



<p>Saying that, Ayana spoke up.</p>



<p>“Is it okay?”</p>



<p>“Yes. We’ve been together all the time lately… Ah, of course, my desire to be by Towa-kun’s side hasn’t wavered at all. But since Aisaka-kun invited you out, it would be nice to go.”</p>




<p>…Yeah, Ayana said that, so today, I’ll hang out with Aisaka!</p>



<p>“What about you, Ayana?”</p>



<p>“I don’t have anything particular in mind, so I’m thinking of going straight home. So don’t worry about me; I’ll be fine. I’ll even send you a message once I’m home, if you like.”</p>



<p>“Ahaha… You don’t have to go that far, you know?”</p>



<p>“Is that so? Muu…”</p>



<p>As expected, it would be tougher for Ayana, who carries such heavy feelings, to do that.</p>



<p>After exchanging a few words with Ayana, Aisaka and I left the school building together.</p>



<p>It feels a bit lonely not hearing the voices of the sports clubs outside… It seems not only the baseball club but also the soccer and track clubs are off today.</p>



<p>“It’s quiet without the clubs practicing outside.”</p>




<p>“Yeah… But it’s kind of relaxing. When you leave the school building and hear the voices of the sports clubs, it feels like the school day is really over.”</p>



<p>“Haha, what the hell.”</p>



<p>No no, that’s just how it is.</p>



<p>We continued our enjoyable conversation as we headed out into the town.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>[Ayana PoV]</strong></p>


<p>“They’ve already left…”</p>



<p>“Aah, if that’s the case, you shouldn’t have let him go with Aisaka. Even if he was going to hang out, Ayana could have gone with them, right?”</p>



<p>Ugh… I must admit, what Setsuna said is true. Originally, I planned to spend today with Towa-kun again, but since Aisaka-kun invited Towa-kun, I prioritized that.</p>



<p>“I do have feelings of wanting to be prioritized by him all the time. But friendships are very important, so I want him to cherish this opportunity.”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“Yes, it is. It’s the same thing I feel towards Setsuna and everyone else.”</p>



<p>“…..Ayana. Don’t say things like that with such a charming expression, even to the same sex!”</p>




<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>



<p>“Are you trying to seduce even women?”</p>



<p>What’s that supposed to mean…?</p>



<p>Certainly, Setsuna is an attractive girl, but I can’t imagine having those kinds of feelings towards someone of the same sex, and I’m not interested in that at all… My love is only for Towa-kun, no matter what the circumstances.</p>



<p>…By the way, I’ll pretend I didn’t see the other friends nodding in agreement with Setsuna’s words!</p>



<p>“So, what about you, Ayana? You told Yukishiro that you were going straight home.”</p>



<p>“That’s my intention. I’ll go home as soon as I finish what I need to do.”</p>



<p>Even though it’s not a big deal.</p>



<p>After exchanging brief greetings with Setsuna and the others, I left the classroom—heading to the student council room where Honjo-senpai would likely be.</p>




<p>“…………”</p>



<p>My reason for coming here is this.</p>



<p>I wasn’t called by Honjo-senpai, nor do I have any specific business to attend to here… I’m just a little curious.</p>



<p>Maybe it’s because I heard about it during lunch break from Towa-kun.</p>



<p>“Is Honjo-senpai here?”</p>



<p>If Honjo-senpai isn’t here, then I’ll go home.</p>



<p>Thinking that, I knocked on the door, and I heard Honjo-senpai’s voice from inside.</p>



<p>“Come in.”</p>



<p>“…Excuse me.”</p>




<p>As I opened the door, the first thing I saw was a large pile of documents on the desk.</p>



<p>Honjo-senpai, who was processing what looked like an overwhelming amount of documents, looked surprised when she saw me.</p>



<p>“Otonashi-san? What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry for coming without notice.”</p>



<p>“It’s not something you need to apologize for. Did we have plans or something?”</p>



<p>It seems that Honjo-senpai, upon my sudden visit, started to doubt whether we had made plans. Um… I feel bad for suddenly coming without a reason, so I should explain first.</p>



<p>“We didn’t have any plans specifically, so if you’re busy, I’ll leave… Um, I just wanted to talk to Honjo-senpai for a bit.”</p>



<p>To be honest, Honjo-senpai’s eyes widened again at my honest admission… Is it really that unusual?</p>



<p>“Otonashi-san, this isn’t the first time you’ve come here, but usually it’s to help me with my work. So, when you say you just want to talk to me, it’s unusual, isn’t it?”</p>




<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>“…Fufu, it’s rare, isn’t it? But it’s okay, please have a seat.”</p>



<p>Is it really okay? Is she really not too busy with all those documents?</p>



<p>Seeing me staring at the documents, Honjo-senpai noticed and reassured me that it wasn’t anything urgent, although I’m not sure if that’s really true. Nevertheless, I felt relieved.</p>



<p>“So, what did you want to talk about?”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>Across the table, Honjo-Senpai gazes at me intently. What do I want to talk about… What should I say?</p>



<p>“I’m sorry. I said I wanted to talk, but I’m just curious.”</p>



<p>“Curious?”</p>




<p>“Yes. I heard about it from Towa-kun during lunch break… and that’s why.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>Honjo-Senpai nods as if understanding.</p>



<p>“I see. Is it about that? Do you feel guilty for introducing him to me?”</p>



<p>“…Maybe.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>Guilt… maybe.</p>



<p>Originally, I only wanted revenge on those who hurt Towa-kun… but, to further torment Shu-kun, I used Honjo-Senpai and Mari-chan.</p>



<p>I… I was planning something terribly awful.</p>




<p>Now, I no longer have such thoughts, but back then, I was truly considering something outrageous… Yet, I can’t just pretend it never happened. As I moved forward, the relationships I prepared became increasingly distorted.</p>



<p>“….Fufu, I never thought you’d be thinking about that.”</p>



<p>“I… “</p>



<p>“Just so you know, I don’t regret meeting Shu-kun. I don’t want to erase the time I spent with him.”</p>



<p>Upon hearing her words, I gaze steadily at Honjo-Senpai.</p>



<p>Without averting her gaze, she returns my stare, emanating warmth and kindness from her eyes.</p>



<p>“As I told you, there are aspects of Shu-kun recently that I find concerning. What he went through was just a simple heartbreak… something everyone experiences in love. I understand his feelings, but his immature refusal to accept it was unbecoming.”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>

<p>“However… even so, the memories I shared with Shu-kun won’t disappear. At first, you helped connect us, and then Shu-kun started interacting with me as his true self. It’s simple, embarrassingly simple, but I enjoyed those times with him.”</p>




<p>“I see…”</p>



<p>“Yes. To say this may be unfair to Shu-kun, but I might be attracted to slightly unreliable boys.”</p>



<p>That’s embarrassing coming from me…Saying so, Honjo-senpai laughs.</p>



<p>Slightly unreliable boys… It might be more than just “slightly,” but indeed, Honjo-senpai always seemed to enjoy her time with Shu-kun.</p>



<p>I didn’t feel any particular emotion watching the two of them become closer… but thinking back, Honjo-senpai truly seemed to enjoy herself.</p>



<p>“So even if I feel pathetic about it, saying goodbye to everything that happened until now would be too lonely.”</p>



<p>“…I see.”</p>



<p>“Well, I thought distancing himself would give him time to heal. And I want him to think about it again—what will happen in the future if things don’t change. Fortunately, it seems your words have resonated quite strongly with Shu-kun.”</p>



<p>I don’t know exactly what Towa-kun said. But I’ve heard that after their argument, Shu-kun couldn’t say anything back when Towa-kun conveyed his thoughts about the future.</p>




<p>“To be able to speak so strongly… it seems that Yukishiro-kun truly loves you, Otonashi-san… I envy you as a woman.”</p>



<p>“…Is that so?”</p>



<p>“Ara, your face is turning red?”</p>



<p>“You’re annoying.”</p>



<p>Ah… I said “annoying”…</p>



<p>Seeing my reaction, Honjo-senpai chuckles and changes the subject—it seems she wants to talk about Towa-kun now.</p>



<p>“That guy… Yukishiro-kun is a very mysterious person. His words have a strong impact.”</p>



<p>“I understand that very well. I’ve been saved many times by Towa-kun’s words.”</p>



<p>Towa-kun’s words resonate deeply in my heart, as if they have some special power.</p>




<p>He saved me, changed me, and encouraged me to move forward—all thanks to Towa-kun’s words.</p>



<p>“What did you two talk about?”</p>



<p>“Just a little… but he said it was just small talk.”</p>



<p>“I see. Did he talk about university-related matters?”</p>



<p>“University?”</p>



<p>Did Towa-kun talk about university matters with Honjo-senpai?</p>



<p>Regardless of Honjo-senpai, it’s still a bit early for Towa-kun and me to discuss our future, but it’s still a little concerning…</p>



<p>At first, I thought it was just a casual conversation about which university and what studies he wanted to pursue, but what Honjo-senpai told me was unexpected.</p>



<p>“He also mentioned that there are suspicious circles in university, so he warned me to be careful.”</p>




<p>“Suspicious circles?”</p>



<p>“That… so-called ‘hook-up circles,’ perhaps?”</p>



<p>Hook-up circles… meaning clubs with that purpose in mind?</p>



<p>Shady individuals… of course, there might be women involved as well, but I have knowledge about such circles existing.</p>



<p>(…For a moment, it felt a bit unsettling that it aligned with my past thoughts.)</p>



<p>One of the schemes to ensnare Honjo-senpai when she went to university… perhaps I even considered that. Why did I think so?</p>



<p>“Anyway…?”</p>



<p>Let’s hear the rest for now.</p>



<p>“At first, I was shocked to hear something like that out of the blue. But after calmly thinking about it, there’s no way I would go near such a suspicious circle, and even if a close friend invited me, I wouldn’t join.”</p>




<p>“Right.”</p>



<p>“Right? So at that moment, I laughed… but… but you know? For some reason, I couldn’t just laugh off Yukishiro-kun’s words… his concern. I don’t know why… so I thought he’s a mysterious person.”</p>



<p>“…………….”</p>



<p>“In the end, I accepted his advice and thanked Yukishiro-kun for it—’Thank you, I’ll be careful.'”</p>



<p>Honjo-senpai must have been puzzled by Towa-kun’s sudden talk about it…… but she still accepted it and even thanked him because he trusts Towa-kun?</p>



<p>“So Towa-kun helped Honjo-senpai too?”</p>



<p>“It’s not like I was in any danger? But it was good to be strongly reminded to be careful. I believe in myself… but since I believe in myself so strongly, it’s possible for someone to trip me up.”</p>



<p>“Indeed, Honjo-senpai seems reliable, but also a bit clumsy.”</p>



<p>“Can’t you be more straightforward, Otonashi-san?”</p>




<p>“Ah…”</p>



<p>I said it…</p>



<p>Seeing me cover my mouth in surprise, Honjo-senpai puffs up her cheeks, but she doesn’t seem too bothered, which is a relief.</p>



<p>Honjo-senpai continues speaking while looking out the window with her arms crossed.</p>



<p>“Yukishiro-kun’s idea was outlandish… but at the same time, there was a strange feeling that it might not be. Hey, Otonashi-san.”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>“Yukishiro-kun isn’t secretly a time traveler, right?”</p>



<p>“What are you saying?”</p>



<p>“Fufu, of course not, that’s absurd.”</p>




<p>If Towa-kun were a time traveler… ~hmm, given that he saved everything about me as if he could see through me, it might be amusing to consider that.</p>



<p>“Even if… well, even if Towa-kun were a time traveler or had something different from us, I wouldn’t mind. I love everything about Towa-kun… I accept everything about him, and I want to be with him.”</p>



<p>“Ara, that’s quite a sudden display of affection.”</p>



<p>“I do indulge sometimes. After all, I have such a wonderful boyfriend by my side.”</p>



<p>Honjo-senpai shows interest by leaning forward.</p>



<p>But… lately, I’ve been liking Towa-kun so much that when this feeling of affection starts to run wild, I can’t seem to stop talking.</p>



<p>Haa… I really need to fix this.</p>



<p>“Your love is quite heavy, Otonashi-san. Won’t Yukishiro-kun be crushed by it someday?”</p>



<p>“I don’t think so. Towa-kun accepts everything about me.”</p>




<p>“Quite a lot of trust, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“Because that’s who we are.”</p>



<p>I understand that my love is heavy… and Towa-kun also understands that he accepts me like this. That’s why I can say this.</p>



<p>Honjo-senpai just laughs at me lavishing affection… in the meantime, I continue speaking.</p>



<p>“Just as you thought, Honjo-senpai, I believe there’s something special about Towa-kun.”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“Yes. I can’t say I’m not curious about what it is, but regarding that, I’ll just wait for Towa-kun to tell me.”</p>



<p>“…That’s lovely.”</p>



<p>“Yes, Towa-kun is very lovely… but.”</p>




<p>“?”</p>



<p>“No matter what the truth is, when I find out, I think my love will surely evolve beyond what it is now♪”</p>



<p>“That’s something I’d like to see.……”</p>



<p>I’m constantly saying ‘I love Towa-kun’ all the time, aren’t I? … Well, saying that would make me feel too silly to bear… I can’t deny it completely, but I’ll be careful!</p>



<p>“Talking with you, Otonashi-san, is always enjoyable. Seeing you, who is straightforward about your feelings for the person you love, warms my heart.”</p>



<p>“Even though I was the one doing all the talking…”</p>



<p>“That’s what makes it enjoyable. Well then, I should get back to work soon.”</p>



<p>“Ah, I’m sorry for taking up so much of your time.”</p>



<p>“It’s fine. Please come again sometime, okay? If you ever feel lonely and want to talk to me, feel free to come by anytime?”</p>




<p>She said with a grin, and I denied that I came because I was lonely.</p>



<p>But even for me, the time spent talking with Honjo-senpai was so enjoyable that I sincerely hoped for another opportunity like this.</p>



<p>“Oh, right!”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>Honjo-senpai clapped her hands suddenly.</p>



<p>“We’ve known each other for quite some time now, right? So how about we start using a more friendly way to address each other?”</p>



<p>“By using our first names? Iori-senpai?”</p>



<p>If that’s what she meant, I’ll take the initiative.</p>



<p>Honjo… Iori-senpai widened her eyes, but then nodded happily.</p>




<p>“Yes! Ayana-san!”</p>



<p>And thus, we started calling each other by our first names.</p>



<p>After such an exchange, I left the student council room and headed home—walking home without Towa-kun beside me felt quite refreshing, but still lonely.</p>



<p>“Towa-kun is a mysterious person… right?”</p>



<p>Reflecting on my conversation with Iori-senpai, I muttered such thoughts.</p>



<p>Towa-kun is truly a mysterious person… why is he able to save so many people in different ways?</p>



<p>“…Haa, I’m hopeless.”</p>



<p>Thinking about Towa-kun like this inevitably makes me miss him.</p>



<p>After checking the time on my smartphone screen, I walked towards Towa-kun’s house instead of my own…Yare yare, I’m really a troubled woman.</p>
