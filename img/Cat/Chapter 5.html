<h1>Chapter 5: Acceleration to Collapse</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After being
hospitalized for several days for examinations, Nozomu was finally allowed to
go to school today.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Good grief, I'm
finally freed......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu breathed a sigh
of relief as he walked along the street to the school. Although he was under
observation, he had been told to rest and was bored out of his mind during his
stay in the hospital.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But the rumors
haven't been completely dispelled yet. What do I do? ......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu was able to
dispel the rumor that he was weak during the mock combat, but the main issue
here was the rumor about him being the worst scumbag who betrayed Lisa. Nozomu
believed that the mock combat would have no effect on this one.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, it's no
point dwelling over it. At any rate, let's go to the school first."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After arriving at the
school, Nozomu headed to his classroom.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was already the
second period. The hallway was deserted, and Nozomu's footsteps were the only
sounds echoing in the spacious hallway.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu looked over to
the windows and saw first-year students engaged in basic training.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They were being taught
how to swing wooden swords and wield weapons, just as Nozomu and his classmates
had done two years earlier.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In his hometown, he
himself wielded a wooden sword as part of his training, but here was the first
time he learned how to wield it properly.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If one were to look
closely, one could see among the sword-wielding students, there were Eldor and
others that Nozomu had rescued in the sewers recently.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(Which means, this
class is the 1st class of the first grade, huh?......)</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu kept looking at
the training grounds with a sideways glance as he proceeded down the corridor.
When he passed by the first-grade classrooms, the bell rang to announce the end
of the second period.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Did you
understand the lesson just now?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, not at all!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">First graders came out
of their classrooms, their voices filled with excitement.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu is currently at
the crossroads that connects the first-grade classrooms and the crossing
corridor. Inevitably, the underclassmen coming out of their classrooms would
head toward where Nozomu is.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And then Nozomu's eyes
met those of one of the girls coming out of the classroom.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah......."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hm?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The female student who
saw Nozomu had a surprised expression on her face. Nozomu tilted his head at
the strange reaction of a girl he didn't know.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When he looked
closely, he saw that the other students who were with her were also looking at
him with surprised expressions for some reason.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At first, Nozomu
thought the reaction might be because they knew about the bad rumors about him,
but he could not detect any negative feelings of contempt or ridicule in their
gazes.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that moment, the
female student whose eyes met Nozomu's stepped forward.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"U-Umm. Nozomu
Bountis-senpai, right ......?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well,
yes.......?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The girl was looking
up at Nozomu while fidgeting and intertwining her fingers in front of her
chest.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To a junior who spoke
to him with a timid air, Nozomu also replied awkwardly</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Umm, I'd like to
ask you something... I heard that you possess Ability Suppression, is that true
......?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While tilting his
head, Nozomu nodded his head slightly. The girl in front of him suddenly smiled
widely and leaned forward. Her eyes were shining with a sparkling light of
admiration.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"U-Umm! I saw the
mock combat the other day!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-I
see......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu couldn't help
but flinch at this underclassman's strangely forceful words.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">On the other hand, the
excited girl, unaware of his reaction, kept on speaking like a broken dam.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I was very
moved! You can't move well due to your Ability Suppression, and yet you're able
to compete with that Jihad-sensei!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, I wasn't
really exchanging direct blows with him, though......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Unlike Nozomu, whose
perceptions tend to deviate in odd angles, the girl in front of him is just an
ordinary student with normal perception.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He made Jihad, who was
known as a hero, drew his treasured sword and even managed to take one of his
arms from him. Combined with her admiration for Nozomu, she perceived him to be
as powerful as Jihad.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I was able to
enter this academy, but it didn't go as smoothly as I expected....... There are
a lot of students who are much better at magic and Qi-jutsu than I
am......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But suddenly, the girl
looks dejected.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is true that this
school attracts many talented students from all over the continent. However,
there are many who are hailed as child prodigies in their hometowns but are
confronted with reality when they come here. This girl may be one of them.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, the girl's
downcast expression quickly changed, and she once again turned her passionate
eyes on Nozomu.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But! When I saw
Nozomu-senpai's appearance at that time, I understood! Even if I can't win by
sheer strength, there are so many things I can do! I don't have much talent!
I'm also in the tenth class, but I've come to think that it doesn't
matter!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-I
see......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Leaving the bewildered
Nozomu behind, the girl became even more heated.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, with a hint of
heartfelt admiration, she suddenly took Nozomu's hand.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Huh!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm rooting for
you, Nozomu-senpai! Please do your best!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"T-Thanks......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After letting go of
his hand and bowing, the girl quickly returned to her friends.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The friends who
welcomed the girl back were somewhat squealing, but Nozomu was stunned, unable
to follow the situation at all.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Huh? Something's
wrong......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Not really.
Their reactions are completely normal."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While Nozomu was
bewildered by the unprecedented reactions of the people around him, Norn called
out to him with a hint of a smile on her face.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Norn-sensei,
what is this all about?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"While Nozomu-kun
was hospitalized, the school was full of talk about you. It's a hot topic,
especially among the underclassmen, and they're all very curious about
you."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Surprised, Nozomu
turned his gaze once again to the corridor in front of the first-grade
classrooms and saw many underclassmen peering at him from inside the classrooms
and from the corridor.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, they even
asked me about the rumors regarding Lisa-kun. Whenever they asked, I told them
that the rumors were nonsense and unfounded. The underclassmen haven't been
around long enough after hearing the rumors. So, when they saw you fighting so
valiantly against Jihad-sensei, they believed you weren't the scumbag they had heard
about."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu's eyes widened
at what had transpired while she was resting.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, what Norn
uttered next left him completely speechless.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But I think, the
most significant of all was because of Irisdina and the others."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"As soon as you
collapsed, Irisdina and Shina were the first to rush to your aid, and they
desperately tried to save you."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">According to Norn, the
way the girls, who were admired by everyone and looked up to by teachers,
desperately tried to save him touched the underclassmen's hearts.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">"Moreover, you
helped Eldor and his friends recently, right?</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">　</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">It was also significant that they had told the stories
of that time to their surrounding schoolmates. After hearing that you actually
helped those close to you, everyone realized that you are not the cold-blooded
bastard that you are rumored to be."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So that's how it
was......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They heard about the
real Nozomu from Irisdina and the others, from Norn-sensei, and from Eldor and
his friends. These things helped to dispel the false image of Nozomu that had
been imprinted on the underclassmen.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, Norn, who had
been smiling earlier, suddenly grew gloomy.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But I'm still
skeptical about the third- and fourth-graders who have been enrolled since
those rumors started circulating......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Aside from the
first-graders who just enrolled in the school and the second-graders who did
not know when the rumors circulated, the students who have heard the rumors for
a long time apparently still haven't entirely dispelled the false rumors.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Considering that only
a few days have passed since Nozomu and Jihad had their mock combat, it is
hardly enough to dispel the rumors that have been circulating for several
years.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, considering
all that has happened, it's enough. Really ...... it's more than enough."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His friends sentiments
touched Nozomu's heart as he recalled their struggling efforts.</span></span></p>

outer perimeter of the park was deserted, and the wooded area was naturally
empty of people. Nozomu was sheltering from the rain at the base of a tree in
the wooded area, waiting for Camilla's arrival.</span></span></p>

is a gigantic empire that governs the southwestern part of the Arcmel
Continent. It is one of the most powerful nations on the continent. On the
other hand, it has taken a step back when it comes to the management of
Arcazam.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is because they
are wary of the Forsina Kingdom, the Alliance of Small Nations, and the Sumahya

Invasion, the Empire was the most powerful hegemonic power on the Arkmel
Continent, and it made various overbearing demands on neighboring nations.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, hegemonic
nations are prone to internal strife because they lack external threats. The
Cremazzone Empire is no exception to this rule, and has always been politically
divided, and furthermore, its national power was severely weakened by the Great
Invasion.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nowadays, when
neighboring countries unite, since eliminating them single-handedly would be
difficult, the empire in its decline has been forced to adopt a course of
cooperation with them.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes. According

the Empire's citizens in Arcazam had to leave their homeland for a variety of
reasons.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Naturally, some have
their own reasons. Camilla was one of them.</span></span></p>

Camilla reached into her pocket. She took out a rainbow-colored comb. It was a
side comb, imbued with magic power and clearly a magical tool.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This's

it."</span></span></p>

chipped in several places. Camilla began to comb her hair by brushing it to the
side.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, her
brown-colored hair began to turn red from the roots, and gradually turned into
a greyish-red color.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The color of her eyes
also changed, and her facial features resembled those of someone Nozomu knew.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That hair color,

at the sudden confession, but he took a deep breath once to calm his shaken
mind.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Does Lisa know

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Why?"</span></span></p>

comprehend those words for a moment.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He heard that Lisa's
father had died before they both met, but he did not know the cause of his
death.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, the presence
of her late father was very significant in Lisa's mind and was the reason for
her to become an adventurer and to come to Arcazam.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What do you mean by

questioning look, Camilla frowned and cast her eyes downward as she tried to
squeeze the words out of her mouth.</span></span></p>

ruled the southwestern part of the continent for hundreds of years. A land of
sand and rock, prairies, and volcanoes. A land that continues to influence the
entire continent, both historically and culturally. Also, although it supported
the construction of Arcazam, it has kept its distance from it.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Also, the fact

belief on this continent is animism centered on the spirits of the six

different. Since its founding, humans, known as Dragon Slayers, have been
deified rather than spirits.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is because the
first emperor, a Dragon Slayer, had conquered various tribes that were in
rivalry for power, and as a result, the empire prospered.</span></span></p>

Uncle was a rather curious person, and as an aristocrat, he didn't care much

whom he married and had a child with."</span></span></p>

of women who could no longer bear children tended to be relatively low.
Camilla's mother was apparently one such woman.</span></span></p>

managed to escape to a free city in the Delta Zone, where they were able to
survive.</span></span></p>

resist, she was up against a substandard human being who could contract with

was so frustrated that she ended up cooperating with Ken.</span></span></p>

the Spasim Forest, that spirit tried to destroy Nozomu's spirit and cripple
him.</span></span></p>

manipulated an extraordinary existence known as the Cracked-Crown Giant
Centipede. Even Razward himself said that the ability to manipulate the mind
itself was extraordinary. So, manipulating memories should be a simple task for
it.</span></span></p>

the current you ...... you would never hurt Lisa. You're not the same as when
you pointed your sword at Lisa in the Spasim forest at that time. And also, it
was because I saw Irisdina-san and the others' appearance in the arena, I
think."</span></span></p>

to Nozomu, who had fought until his spirit and soul were exhausted and had

down from her eyes, which were staring petrified at the outstretched hand.</span></span></p>

mouth, she broke down in tears. Nozomu watched silently as she let out an
overflowing sob.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Eventually, Camilla
slowly raised her head. Her eyes, while retaining some of the gloomy darkness
from earlier, shone with the light of a certain will.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"When it's all

undone. Still, she should do what she had to do now. With this renewed
determination, Camilla grasped Nozomu's hand back.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Then let's move

the memory alteration done by the spirit continued to weigh on Lisa's psyche.
On top of that, there were Ken and Starlight working together with him. So they
had to move quickly.</span></span></p>

voice echoed through the darkened wooded area.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[I can't let you do

upon hearing the voice of the lesser water spirit called Mefi. Nozomu stood
back to back with Camilla and scanned his surroundings.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">(I can't see her. Is

Cracked-Crown Giant Centipede and fought Nozomu, she received a severe blow
from him, so it seemed that she was only sending out her voice from afar.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">[A-aa~. Is this how
it's going to be after all? I knew it would end up like this. I wonder if Lisa
will be sad to hear that she was betrayed by even her own family?]</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">"You sure know

Mefi's provoking line, Nozomu kept searching for the presence of the lesser
spirit that might be hiding in the depths of the darkness. The other party was
one of the spirits who could manipulate supernatural powers. Nozomu has learned
firsthand how troublesome these powers can be.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">However, he could not
detect the slightest sign of the spirit. When he looked closely, he could see
that a thin mist of source element enveloped his surroundings, and the bustle
of the city, which should have been audible in the distance, was gone.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">Perhaps it is the
spirit's technique of concealing its presence and separating itself from its
surroundings.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">The silence was
accompanied by a growing tension. The cold evening breeze ruffled the branches
and leaves of the trees, and the shadows that had been stretching out were
already beginning to assimilate with the darkness. Suddenly, multiple small
shadows leaped out from the bushes in front of them.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">"~, Camilla, get
down!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">While forcing Camilla
beside him to get down, Nozomu reflexively parried the object that flew toward
him with his sheathed katana.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">It was a throwing
dagger painted black. Immediately after, figures wearing black cloaks jumped
out.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">There were three of
them. They drew black-painted daggers from their pockets and attacked Nozomu
and Camilla at once.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">Three black figures
run toward Nozomu. They aimed at his right thigh, right neck, and left flank.
Perhaps already enchanted with reinforcement magic, they came at him like a
gust of wind.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">Coupled with the
black-painted blades, it was a blow that would be impossible for an ordinary
person to even see.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">"Fuh~!"</span></p>

those blows away with a single, sudden slash. In a split second, the blade,
which had been carefully polished, drew a smooth curve, and the blade,
strengthened by magic power, cut through oncoming blades as if slicing through
dry branches.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">Following this, Nozomu
lowered his stance and sent his Qi into both hands to compress them. He simultaneously
thrust his arms out and then released them.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;">[Qi-jutsu</span><span face="&quot;ＭＳ 明朝&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;" lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;ＭＳ 明朝&quot;; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">・</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;">Shock Cannon]</span></span></p>

was released, blowing away all three Starlights at once. The three assailants
immediately reacted and stood up, but the hoods of two of the three were pulled
off, exposing the faces of rough-looking men.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">"Are these guys
Starlights? But why did they attack us? Since that spirit is around, I'm sure
that Ken bastard is up to something....... Camilla, are you okay on your
side?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">"Yeah, I'm fine

starlight held up its right hand and produced a fireball in its palm.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">Immediately after, the
magic, which had instantly grown huge to the height of a person, was unleashed
on Nozomu and Camilla.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">"Guu......!"</span></p>

talented enough to belong to the first class. Her quickly spun chanting
deployed a magic barrier to block the fireball. However, Camilla let out a cry
of anguish at the unexpected power, and the magic barrier dissipated in the
form of being counterbalanced by the fireball. Clearly, this was not the power
of magic released in a few verses of chanting. If classified by rank, this
hooded figure definitely belongs to the A rank. And probably the other two are
equally as powerful.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">Even for members of an

Nozomu and Camilla's hearts grow cold was the empty eyes peering out from
behind their hoods.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">The Starlights they
faced showed no human-like emotions, such as murderous intent, fighting spirit,
fear, or nervousness.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">It was as if they had
forgotten their hearts somewhere or were in a state of total apathy from the
very beginning. In a sense, this is the perfect image of someone who lurks in
the shadows, but it is just too lifeless.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">"I see, are you

through the wooded area. It seemed that this spirit really likes to get on
people's nerves.</span></p>

receiving just one blow."</span></p>

Nozomu provoked her back, and Mefi again sent forth the three Starlights that
she manipulated.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: arial; line-height: 200%;">Nozomu glanced at
Camilla and, with his whole body on full alert, intercepted the approaching
Starlights.</span></p>

controlled by Mefi, perhaps wary of being cut in half at close range, switched
their tactics to attacking from afar.</span></p>

firing fireballs and magic bullets, the Starlights blended into the shadows and
threw their throwing daggers from the blind spots as if weaving through the
gaps between one's awareness.</span></p>

If one can determine the trajectory from those factors, it is possible to
handle it. However, there are very few people who can do this.</span></p>

transmitted to the puppets, slowing their movements for a moment. Using this
opportunity, Nozomu closed the gap to one of the Starlights at once and struck
him with [Mumei]'s ridge.</span></p>

sliced a tuft of Mefi's hair, but it was not enough to make a decisive blow.
Mefi managed to avoid it by a hair's breadth, and then turned her back and
started to flee at once.</span></p>

enough to stop the spirit, which is an apex being. The magic that restrained
her was quickly shattered by the source element that erupted from Mefi's body
along with a high-pitched cursing voice.</span></p>

for a few seconds. But in those few seconds, Nozomu had made his way around
Mefi's escape route. As the lesser water spirit's eyes widened, he infused his
Qi into the blade once again.</span></p>

about to reflexively launch his [Mumei], the face of the shadow hidden by the

in the darkness. The dual-wielding shadow was, to his surprise, Lisa. Nozomu's
katana, which he was about to swing forth, stopped as if frozen in place.
Meanwhile, with an inorganic expression on her face, Lisa concentrated her
magic power in the palm of her hand and cast a powerful blast of flame toward
the stunned Nozomu.</span></p>

formed a sphere that could be held in both hands. It glowed with a pale, eerie
light and had an outward appearance that was fitting to be called a blood

the lesser spirit's body and melted into it. The next moment, an enormous
amount of source element erupted from Mefi's body. Perhaps she had absorbed
Camilla's magic power through her blood.</span></p>

out of Lisa's mouth, as if she couldn't comprehend the scene in front of her.
Her gaze repeatedly went back and forth between the fallen Camilla and the
curved blade that had pierced her, and her stunned expression gradually froze.</span></p>

smile grew uglier and she turned her blue palm to Lisa and turned into a mass

voice and tried to pounce on her, but Mefi, who had assimilated Lisa, took the
initiative to suppress him with her words. Like the Cracked-Crown Giant
Centipede, Lisa is simply being manipulated by Mefi. Nozomu had no choice but
to stop, his momentum slowed down.</span></p>

Mefi manipulated Lisa's body, picked up the curved sword that had fallen at her

Mefi sneered and boosted her power. The source element of water erupted from
Lisa's body, which Mefi assimilated with, enveloping her body like a mist.</span></p>

with both hands, but the blood did not stop flowing, and the ground, where the
blood was spreading, turned even redder. The stabbing wound from behind
penetrated through the torso and was obviously a life-threatening wound.</span></p>

poured a potion from his waist pouch over it, but the wound was too deep and
the bleeding would not stop. He had to get her to a place where she could be
treated quickly.</span></p>

Camilla pulled out a blood-soaked piece of paper from her pocket. On it was

about to put the paper in his pocket and proceed with the treatment, several
guards jumped out from the shadows of the wooded area with their rattling
armor.</span></p>

spears and rods in their hands and long swords at their waists. They had obviously
been dispatched in response to a report of some kind.</span></p>

down at the restrained Nozomu slammed the butt of his spear into the side of
his head.</span></p>

him in the head. The guards rushed to Camilla, who fell to the ground
unconscious.</span></p>

had kept this story a secret, but Nozomu was a promising star who had fought a
narrow battle with Jihad Roundel. Therefore, information leaked out of nowhere,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">On the other side,
Irisdina also did not stop her questioning eyes.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Despite his
outstanding swordsmanship and combat skills, Nozomu has no experience in such
political maneuvering.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Combined with his
good-natured personality, there was a good chance that he would be taken
advantage of by those concealing their malicious intentions.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That was why Irisdina
had to be sure. The reason why this hero came to Nozomu's backing.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jihad-sensei,
did you become Nozomu's backer because you are an educator? Or was it to avenge
your comrades killed by the demonic beasts?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"As an educator.
And as a swordsman who respects him for having reached such a level."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad left the
battlefield and came to this academy for the sake of the youths who will
shoulder the future.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For Jihad, Nozomu was
irreplaceable for the future of this continent.</span></span></p>

cornered Jihad if he had wanted to at the time when they crossed blades at the
martial arts garden. That was if he had used the power of the dragon that
resided in his body.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But he did not use
that power. He decided to fight Jihad not with the power he had miraculously
obtained, but only with the training he had accumulated by his own will.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There were almost no
conversations exchanged between them. But that fact was more than enough for
Jihad to believe in Nozomu. Because a person's true feelings do ensue from his
actions, not from his words.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Oi, jou-chan.]</span></span></p>

looks like Jihad-sensei isn't lying to you. At least, neither Raz nor I can
detect any malice in his words."</span></span></p>

interrupted.</span></span></p>

words, Irisdina took a deep breath and finally released her tension.</span></span></p>

understand. I believe it. Jihad-sensei, please forgive me for my many rude
remarks and actions."</span></span></p>

about it. Rather, I thank you for believing in me. I do not blame you for
seeing me as a suspicious person who probes the privacy of your friends."</span></span></p>

Irisdina and the others, Jihad has not yet been told of Nozomu's secret by
Nozomu himself. It was only natural for them to be wary. Once the atmosphere
had calmed down, Jihad went on to the main topic.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Actually, I
could imagine that someone from this city and from the academy was behind Ken
Nortice. But we still don't know exactly who or where this person is."</span></span></p>

choice but to catch that lesser spirit and Ken Nortice."</span></span></p>

both Ken Notice and that lesser spirit are missing. Also, Lisa-san as

squinted upon hearing Inda's follow-up words.</span></span></p>

girls' dormitory at the academy and found that she hasn't been back to her dorm
since yesterday. Most likely, Ken Notice and that lesser spirit known as Mefi
have abducted her."</span></span></p>

that would be unlikely. It sounds more reasonable to assume that they are still
inside the city. So, we need your help. Especially you and your lesser spirit
partner."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad's eyes turned to
Shina and Razward. Everyone looked as though they were understood.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Everyone present knew
that Ken Notice was known as the [Spirit's Illegitimate Child] and that he had
made a contract with a spirit. It was only natural that Jihad would seek help
from Shina, who is an elf and has also made a contract with a spirit.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If it is for

Nozomu's secrets to ourselves. As for Ken Nortice, we are going to catch him
and expose those who have been cooperating with him. We have many other things
we need to confirm."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Many of Ken's actions
could not be accomplished without a collaborator of considerable power within
Arcazam.</span></span></p>

that he was able to conceal the existence of the spirit and the fact that he
himself is the [Spirit's Illegitimate Child].</span></span></p>

at Irisdina's words.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was unnatural that
such a powerful demonic beast happened to be on the outskirts of Arcazam
amongst such a vast Spasim forest. But is it really possible that someone could
capture a demonic beast as powerful as the [Six Bad Omens]?</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If such a thing were
possible, the technique would have been disclosed long ago, and the threat of
the [Six Bad Omens] would have long since disappeared. There is so little
information available that it is difficult to even speculate. With so many
unknowns, Jihad and Co. must capture the spirit that controlled the
Cracked-Crown Giant Centipede and its contractor so that they can find the
answer.</span></span></p>

good lead on where he is. He has a contract with a water spirit. If it is a
place where it is easy to access power and suitable for movement with the
contractor, then there is only one possible location."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With that, Jihad
pointed his index finger downward.</span></span></p>
