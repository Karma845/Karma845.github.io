<h1>Final Chapter</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Late afternoon in the
Central Park. Under the glorious early summer sun, Irisdina was having lunch in
the woods area. She is surrounded by her sister Somia, Mars, Tima, and other
friends including Shina.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So, how was this
incident ultimately handled?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Because of the
nature of the incident, it was kept under wraps."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina answered
Mars' question succinctly.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Three days have passed
since the incident. All traces of the battle had already been erased. The City
Isolation Barrier, which was triggered by Ken's Predatory Barrier, was also
reported to each district simply as an impromptu activation drill, and Arcazam
had returned to normal daily life.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"In the end, we
were left out in the cold. That fellow Jihad seemed to have figured something
out, though."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Mena......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Unfortunately, I
don't know either. However, there's no doubt that this case is related to a deep-rooted
problem in this city."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken, who had fused
with the Abyss Grief, had its magic stone destroyed with his heart. However,
his body has not yet died, and he can still repeat reflex actions, albeit
slightly. He is already unable to fight or even move properly. However, if one
carelessly touches it, there is no telling how it will react again.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As a result, the
Arcazam Parliament decided to physically seal him in a space devoid of any kind
of power.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The location was the
basement of the Gloaurum Institution. It was originally designed to block all
outside forces for all kinds of magic experiments, which is why it was chosen
as the sealing place. There was no other suitable location.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Pitiful, one might
say. But at the same time, many mysteries remained a mystery.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Most of those
who had conspired against Nozomu-sama had become cripples. According to Jihad,
they were originally criminals who infiltrated from outside the city. The same
is true of faculty member Caskell, who is unlikely to recover......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It is also
unlikely that any important information will come out of Bellaluna and the
others, who are only at the further end of the line. The only clue that remains
is the location mentioned in the paper that Camilla handed to
Nozomu......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sewage system
damaged by the flash floods has not yet been fully restored. As various parts
of it have collapsed and are submerged. Ken's supposed hideout was in this same
area. They probably haven't been able to investigate it yet.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Which means it
will take some more time to find out who's behind him......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, everyone
present here was aware of this. This case is quite deep-rooted. After all,
there was Ken, who devoured a spirit and transformed into a deformed form. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina glanced at
Shina.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Shina-kun,
during the last battle, you were definitely fused with him, right......?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, it was the
deformed demonic beast that we fought together with Nozomu-kun. I could still
feel the presence of that beast in the source element that I sensed from
Ken."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Abyss Grief. A
deformed spirit. It is unknown how it came to take that form, but certainly not
a coincidence.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">An indescribable sense
of uneasiness welled up within Irisdina, and she frowned.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Irisdina-ojousama,
I think it would be difficult for us to find out more than this. I suggest we
refresh our minds."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes, I suppose
so. Sorry Mena, can you make us some tea?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina nodded at her
trusted attendant's words, and Mena bowed her head respectfully and left the
room.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After a short while,
she returned with a pot of tea. Irisdina and the others sipped the tea that had
been handed out to them.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The girls exhaled in
relief as the aroma tickled their taste buds and the hot liquid sloshed down
their throats.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So, Mena. What
about Nozomu.......?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I hear he's
going to attend the sealing of Ken Notie at the Gloaurum Institution with
Lisa-sama......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I see.......”</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina looked out of
the window as she let out a somewhat lonely sigh. Shina, who was standing next
to her, was also looking out the window as if she was observing him from afar.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A sweet pain, different
from the one they felt before, runs through their chests. They wondered, how
those two resolved things.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sun, illuminating
the cityscape, gazed upon the maidens who were thinking of their love.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>‡</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Deep in the basement
of the Gloaurum Institution. Nozomu and Lisa were descending a long spiral
staircase.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In front of them were
Jihad, Inda, and Anri. And then there was Fadrey, the head of the Gloaurum
Institution.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The magical lamps
placed in various places illuminated the pitch-dark vertical shafts, and the
light from the lanterns held by each of them swayed and flickered.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I didn't know
there was a facility this deep down......."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The institute
itself was built before Arcazam was established, and there are various
underground facilities that are rarely found above ground. The place we are
going to is one of them."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The group continued to
descend the stairs as Nozomu and Lisa gasped at Fadrey's explanation.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sound of Fadrey's
cane tapping on the stairs echoed through the spiral staircase.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">About 50 meters down
the spiral staircase, a heavy, solid door appeared before their eyes. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Four guards were
waiting in front of the door.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Is this the
place?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes, it is. This
is one of the magic laboratories of the institute. Because of its intended
purpose, it has been sealed off to prevent the leakage of magic power and
elements from the surroundings. It's a good enough place to keep him in custody
for this particular case."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In response to
Fadrey's words, Nozomu and Lissa have a complicated look on their faces.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ignoring their
reactions, Fadrey gestured towards the guards on duty, to which they placed
their hands on the door of the magic laboratory. The large door creaked open
and Fadrey's group stepped into the laboratory.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The laboratory was
dimly lit, with only a handful of candlesticks standing in various places to
illuminate the room. Nozomu squinted and looked around. It was circular, about
20 meters in diameter. In the center of the room was a circular stone platform.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">On the platform laid
Ken. His limbs were bound with steel shackles, and he was crucified on the
platform.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His eyes were vacant
as he looked up at the ceiling, showing no reaction to Nozomu and the others
who had entered the room.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was a fist-sized
hole in his left chest. Clearly, a fatal wound. But even with such a wound, his
chest was still quietly rising and falling, and he was breathing repeatedly.
Seeing Ken like this, Lisa's expression clouded even more.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa......."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm...
okay......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While Lisa took
several deep breaths to calm herself down, Fadrey approached Ken cautiously,
held up the lantern in his hand, and began to examine his condition.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">“</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">His respiratory system, circulatory system, and other
vital functions are functioning properly. However, there is still no response
to light, sound, or other external stimuli."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After cutting off the
source elements, magical power, and anything else that could feed the beast,
the Abyssal Grief was physically sealed. That was the treatment given to Ken
after he fused with the Abyss Grief.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken will never be
released from this place. He will remain sealed in this place as long as he
lives.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That was the decision
made by the parliament.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu-kun......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm fine. I have
to be firm and see it through......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Anri called out to
Nozomu with concern, but Nozomu didn't avert his gaze and continued to stare at
Ken, who was bound on the platform. His determination. He did not turn his eyes
away from it.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps inspired by
him, Lisa, who had been looking a little unsteady, recovered, and, like Nozomu,
kept her eyes fixed on Ken.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The reason they came
here was to see and witness Ken's current condition with their own eyes.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is their last
chance to do so.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's done. There
is no change in his condition. Alright, let's seal it up."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Saying this, Fadrey
walked to the wall of the laboratory and waved his staff in a single motion.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, a magic circle
was drawn in the air, and with a low rumble, the circular platform in the
center of the room began to rise. At the same time, a platform of the same
shape descended from the ceiling.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As it was, the two
circular platforms merged to sandwich Ken, sealing him inside it.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This concludes
the sealing. From now on, this room will be closed until we find a way to deal
with the beast."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Prompted by Fadrey,
Nozomu and the others stepped out of the laboratory, and the doors immediately
began to close.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu and Lisa kept
staring at the depths of the door as it closed with a creaking sound.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When the door was
completely closed, Jihad opened his mouth.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"All that's left
is to deal with the aftermath. You guys can go home now."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As Nozomu and Lisa
disappeared up the spiral staircase they had just come from, Jihad turned to
face Fadrey once again.</span></span></p>

there was a menacing glint in Jihad's eyes. Fadrey was being glared at with a
gaze so intense that it might cause one to wince. The old man, however,
remained as indifferent as ever.</span></span></p>

anything in particular, Fadrey confessed that he was the one who had supported
Ken.</span></span></p>

made a lot of sacrifices for him. Especially preparing pawns that could be

death row prisoners who had been arrested from surrounding countries.</span></span></p>

needed to confirm the true nature of the magic stone of that demonic beast. The

previous cold tone, Fadrey's voice grew higher as he talked about his
experiments with the Abyss Grief's magic stone and the results.</span></span></p>

huge breakthrough."</span></span></p>

close friends, only the three of them here were aware of his status as a
legendary Dragonslayer. The reason for this was to prevent Nozomu from being
taken advantage of by unscrupulous people, so if anyone else had this
information, it was not difficult to imagine what kind of treatment he would
receive in the future.</span></span></p>

rampage incident, a decision was made by the parliament to decide on how to
deal with him, but at that time there was no mention of Nozomu being a
Dragonslayer, and he was simply treated as a student who was able to lift his
Ability Suppression.</span></span></p>

canceled."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad gasped at these

constructing Arcazam-style chanting and formation magic. That is the feat that
Fadrey has accomplished in the last twenty years. In fact, the establishment of
the Gloaurum Institution, Arcazam, and the Solminati Academy would not be
possible without the efforts of this man.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, there were
many aspects of his career that did not add up. Even if it was about the Great

demeanor remained unaffected even when he witnessed Nozomu's Dragon Slayer
power. But now it disappeared, revealing the face of an old man who had grown
old and decrepit. Jihad and the others couldn't believe their eyes at the sight
of the weakest figure they'd ever seen.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Gafu......"</span></span></p>

of Fadrey's mouth, and he collapsed to his knees.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmm, I see. So,

resignation.</span></span></p>

however, his eyes widened with a snap, and he grabbed tightly onto Jihad's arm

bloodshot at the moment of death. Jihad was speechless at the sight of those
eyes that desperately sought something while holding an unfathomable darkness
that resembled an abyss.</span></span></p>

trying to convey something while spewing crimson blood foams from his mouth.
But suddenly, the old man's grip slipped, and it fell to the stone floor, where
his own blood had spread.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The staff he was

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad involuntarily
looked up the spiral staircase. The pitch-black staircase continued upward, and
the top of the staircase was illuminated by a magic light, glowing white. A
black dot crept into the light. It looked like a raven.</span></span></p>

gaze, he saw that the feather that had fallen on Fadrey's body had also
vanished.</span></span></p>

spiral staircase, the guards and doctors who had heard the report were rushing
toward them.</span></span></p>

Jihad took a deep breath to let it out.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's not
something Nozomu should apologize for, is it? Besides, it was I......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">These words also made
Lisa's face cloud over.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even though she was
deceived by Ken's scheming, it was undoubtedly she who hurled abusive slurs at
Nozomu. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And her words were the
decisive factor in plummeting his position at the academy to the bottom of the
barrel.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Umm, I should be
the one to apologize. I have been saying horrible words to you......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Turning to Nozomu,
Lisa bowed deeply. She herself never intended to be forgiven. Still, she felt
she had to apologize properly here.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, I should
have confronted you and Ken in the first place. The only reason I didn't was
because I ran away from you both."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu looked at her
as she lowered her head and slowly stated his true feelings.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His words were colored
by regret. Indeed, Nozomu was rejected by Lisa. On top of being deceived by
Ken's scheme, he was also impatient with his own ability, which was not growing
at all at the time.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, Nozomu was
also responsible for the situation getting so complicated.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He thought that if he
became stronger, it would be for Lisa's sake. He had never faced them, escaping
under the delusion that they would understand him. This was definitely Nozomu's
mistake.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"In the end, we
were saying that we were doing it for each other's sake, but we were not truly
thinking about each other's feelings. We imagined our own convenient stories
and kept turning our backs on each other because it didn't work out. That's why,
I should apologize as well."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Once again, Nozomu
turned toward Lisa and bowed deeply.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And then both of them
raised their heads at the same time, and smiled at each other.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Fufu~, we're
doing something weird, aren't we?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haha, you could
say that again. If people saw us sitting on a park bench in the afternoon with
our heads bowed to each other, they would tilt their heads and wonder what we
were doing."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They smiled and
chuckled at each other for a while. The stagnation that had settled in the
depths of their hearts over the past two years began to wash away. It has been
a long time since they laughed from the bottom of their hearts.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although they both
said they were doing it for the other, their relationship was distorted in that
they were still dependent on each other. The rusty cogs in their relationship
have finally begun to turn.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What are you
going to do from here on out, Lisa?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu asked after
they had laughed for a while.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In response, Lisa
looked upward to the sky and closed her eyes, as if to check something in her
heart.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then she smiled,
turned to Nozomu, and slowly opened her mouth.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I don't know.
I've always wanted to be an adventurer like my father, but I've come to think
that there's more to it than that, and I still want to study many things here,
besides......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After hanging up her
words without finishing them, Lisa quickly closed the distance between herself
and Nozomu. Her moist eyes were staring at him from close range, and she looked
as if she was about to cry.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey.
Nozomu....... If I decide to leave the academy, would you come with me?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A confirming plea. She
knew she wasn't qualified to ask this, but she couldn't help but confirm it.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her eyes, moist as
rubies in the rain, and her mouth trembling, spoke eloquently of her feelings.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu closed his eyes
as if to confirm his own feelings as Lisa stared at him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then he slowly opened
his eyes and faced Lisa's wish.......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm sorry, but I
can't fulfill my promise to you right now."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He flatly rejected it.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I see. I thought
so......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As if she had known it
was coming, Lisa pulled herself away from Nozomu.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu bit his lip as
she moved away with a lonely expression on her face.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Sorry. I
couldn't keep my promise."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, that's not
true. Nozomu, you did keep your promise to me. You supported me so that I could
face my dream properly."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I couldn't keep my
promise. Although Nozomu said so, Lisa smiled gently, but clearly denied what
he said. Nozomu had fulfilled his promise.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It may have taken some
time. Still, it was definitely thanks to Nozomu that Lisa was able to wake up
after running away and averting her eyes.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa is truly glad
that she fell in love with such a man.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The result may not be
a happy ending. However, for Lisa, this feeling was a gift from the love of her
life, more important than anything else.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I have a soft
spot for you, Nozomu. I invited you to this academy, probably because I was
worried. Life as an adventurer is fraught with danger. I thought that you might
suddenly disappear, so I invited you to this academy......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If all she wanted was
to become an adventurer, there was no need for her to go all the way to the
Solminati Academy. She could have joined a guild or other organization near her
hometown and started as an adventurer from there.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The reason she did not
do so was because of her own fears.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But now, she felt that
it was no good to keep dwelling on her regrets and being frightened by her
fears.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's why, I
need to move on from you too."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With that, she rose to
her feet and stood before Nozomu.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu, can I
borrow that katana?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What in the world is
she planning to do with it?</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu tilted his
head, but her straight gaze prompted him to remove his treasured katana from
the sword belt at his waist and hand it over to her.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa drew the [Mumei]
blade she received. The chain-shaped patterns shine in the sunlight.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She then held it in a
reverse grip, and slowly placed the blade against her own hair, which was tied
up in a bundle.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a light slashing
sound, the blade was swung and her long crimson hair was sliced off.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa shook her head
while Nozomu was surprised. Her shoulder-length short hair bounced around
cheerfully.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Un, I feel
refreshed!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She sheathed the
katana and handed it back to Nozomu, smiling as radiantly as a clear sky.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was the same smile
that Nozomu had seen when he first fell in love with her as a young boy.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Short hair suits
you too."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Really?
Thanks!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The last remaining
lump in their chests melted away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While Nozomu was
relieved that they had truly settled their old scores, Lisa stretched out her
arms widely, “Nn~~~!".</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Are you heading
back?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah. I guess
this is where I say goodbye. There's one more person I have to face, after
all."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmm...... I
see.”</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You also still
have things to do, don't you, Nozomu?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You can
tell?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"How many years
do you think we've been together? I can tell that much right away."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu nodded at
Lisa's point. Apparently, his childhood friend in front of him could see right
through what he was thinking. Nozomu returned a wry smile to Lisa, who smiled
sadly, and slowly got up from the bench.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, see you

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He gave a small nod to
Lisa who waved him goodbye, turned around, and walked toward the park's exit.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lisa watched his back
and let out a big sigh as if expressing all her feelings.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"In two years,
we've grown so far apart..."</span></span></p>

his shrinking back, Lisa couldn't help but mutter these words.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But that's okay.
Let's start over again. starting now..."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With that thought in
mind, Lisa turned away from Nozomu and began to walk. In front of her stood a
girl with hair of mixed gray and pale red, standing with an anxious expression.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa... umm, I..."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Seeing her cousin's
still tense expression, Lisa naturally took a deep breath and gulped hard.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(Do  your best...)</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A voice that seemed to
push her back echoed in the back of her ears, and she couldn't help but look
back.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu's back was no
longer visible. But somehow, her heart felt lighter.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Their paths will part
here.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But that was okay.
Deep in her heart, she still had the feelings that her beloved had left her.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With those feelings in
her heart, she would try again. She wanted to become strong enough to stand
beside that person.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Sorry to keep
you waiting, Camila. Shall we walk together?"</span></span></p>

spilling from her eyes, the red-haired girl took a new step forward.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">†</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After parting with
Lisa, Nozomu headed straight for the Francilt mansion.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, just as he
exited the central park, a voice came to his ears like a distant echo.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Looks like you've
managed to clear up a lot of things.]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was Zonne's voice,
drifting into his ear. Perhaps he was using his power as a dragon to deliver
his voice, as there was no sign of the old man in the vicinity. He probably
knew that everything was over and decided to contact him. Nozomu's forehead
broke out in cold sweat.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[You have shown me
your potential. Seeing that you're still alive, there seems to be hope for
you.]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While holding back a
shiver from the cold sweat, Nozomu listened intently to Sonne's words.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Also, that katana you
are carrying. It is beginning to have a will of its own. It seems to have the
ability to absorb and seal the power of the spirits. If you use it wisely, you
might be able to reduce the burden from Tiamat.]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu reflexively
reached for the [Mumei] at his waist and gently touched the hilt. An
indescribable warmth welled up from deep within his chest.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[But it's still
extremely dangerous. As I said before, know your limits. If you don't want to
endanger your friends, don't use her power again. Never again...]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With those words,
Zonne's presence faded into the distance.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Whether he had decided
that there was no need to intervene here or if he had other intentions was
unclear, but at least he seemed to have given Nozomu a reprieve. Nozomu let out
a sigh, releasing his tension, and finally continued on his way.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Arriving at the
Francilt mansion, the sweat had dried, and the remnants of his tension had
faded. At the main gate, he was granted immediate entry by the mansion's maid.
Recalling how he'd been treated as a complete stranger on his first visit, he
couldn't help but let out a wry smile.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Passing the side of
the mansion, he headed towards the garden, where he found Irisdina standing
alone. When their eyes met, she looked a little surprised.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu...... why
are you here?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Here......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Saying this, Nozomu
pulled out a small hair ornament from his pocket.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was the one he'd
given her when they had walked through the city together. Seeing this, her eyes
widen even more.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You came to my
hospital room, right?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, yeah. I
must have left it where I dropped it and then just forgot about it..."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her response was
hesitant and vague.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He gently placed the
hair ornament on the palm of her hand, which she helplessly held out to him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina stared at it
with unfocused eyes, feeling how heavy it was.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I said goodbye
to Lisa... I finally managed to say it."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu's face, though
tinged with sadness, held a sense of relief after settling his complicated
relationship with Lisa.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Is that
so..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Thank you,

thanking me?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Because if it
weren't for you, I wouldn't have been able to properly say goodbye to
Lisa."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Recalling the strange
series of events that had brought them together, Irisdina chuckled.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The first time
we had lunch together, I seem to have asked some pretty rude questions, huh..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's fine.
Thinking about it now, you were the first person to do so. To someone with
nothing but a bad reputation, you asked me directly and without prejudice. If
you hadn't, I might have continued to be stuck in my own mistakes, even while
being aware of them."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Indeed, thanks to his
master, Nozomu was able to become aware of his own escapism. But that was all
his master could do. It was undoubtedly Irisdina who had pushed him to truly
face his past.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...That's why,
I'll say it as many times I can. Truly, thank you."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His repeated words of
gratitude seemed to dissolve the stagnation in Irisdina's heart, and the weight
in her palm began to lighten. Instead, her cheeks were rapidly heating up.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"N-Nozomu, can
you help wear this hair ornament on me?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As if to hide her
blushing cheeks, Irisdina placed the hair ornament in Nozomu's hand and took a
half step closer. Her heart pounded in her chest.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Looking up, she saw
surprise and a similar blush on his face. She couldn't take her eyes away from
him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He picked up the hair
ornament and his fingers brushed against her glossy hair. A sweet numbness
spread through her body.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, with a pleasant
click, the hair ornament was returned to where it belonged.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(Ah, I really

forced to be aware of her feelings at this point.</span></span></p>

she couldn't put those feelings into words.</span></span></p>

wanted to be filled with this comfort.</span></span></p>
