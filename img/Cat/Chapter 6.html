<h1>Chapter 6: Into the Depths of the Pit</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Guard's
headquarters is a four-story building that exists in the center of the
administrative district.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is the stronghold
of the guards who are responsible for the defense and maintaining the public
order in Arcazam. Nozomu was being held in a jail on the third underground
level of the building.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This jail is used to
detain major criminals. The cell is surrounded on all sides by thick masonry
walls, and on one wall there is a thick metal door with small iron bars.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The space between the
cells is wide, and each cell is further encased in a barrier that increases the
strength of the stone walls and doors and prevents any sound from leaking out.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The only light
provided was a magic lamp on the ceiling, which dimly illuminated the inside of
the cell.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(They acted faster
than expected. Moreover, the arrangements for arresting me were also very
precise. This means that Ken has a powerful backer, stronger than I expected.)</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Alone in his prison
cell, Nozomu rested his back against the cold wall, contemplating the
situation.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He had expected this
to some extent since the Cracked-Crown Giant Centipede was controlled by the
lesser spirit known as Mefi, but this time, Nozomu became convinced.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Someone is cooperating
with Ken. And among them are those who are quite familiar with the inner
workings of the academy. They even use people from intelligence organizations
such as the Starlight as puppets. Considering that the guards came at the
perfect time, it is reasonable to assume that Ken or his collaborators were
pulling the strings behind the scenes.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(I can't solve this on
my own. I need to ask for help from Anri-sensei and Jihad-sensei.)</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">How many pawns did Ken
make? As long as he doesn't know the total number of his opponents, it's not a
good idea to continue to be detained like this.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(I wonder if Camilla
is alright......)</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Camilla, who was
seriously injured, was given first aid and then taken away. He didn't know
where she was taken. All Nozomu could do now was pray for her safety.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(The fact that Ken
discarded her in such a manner means that he is no longer interested in her.
But our current situation is still not hopeless either...... There should be
something I can do.)</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ken easily discarded
Camilla, who had been cooperating with him for several years. Even though he
had originally threatened her to cooperate with him by using her past to
blackmail her, he must be truly backed into a corner since he acted in a way
that would kill her.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(Anyway, I have to
think of a way to get out of here.)</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu slowly tapped
the wall on which he was leaning against with the back of his fist. With a hard
thump, a slight ripple of magic light spread across the wall of the cell. It
was designed to prevent destruction caused by magic or Qi-jutsu, and no sound
could be heard from the outside. The barrier completely blocked out sound.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(I don't have
lock-picking skills. So the only way to get out would be by force.)</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If he were to do that,
he would become a real criminal. And everything would be exactly as Ken wanted
it to be.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">How can I get out of
this prison? As Nozomu was lost in thought, he felt a tingling sensation
throughout his body.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He stared at the cell
wall facing the corridor.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Something was
approaching from the end of the corridor. It was something with hostile intent.
His sixth sense, trained in the Spasim forest where demonic beasts roam,
detected an approaching presence even though he did not hear a sound.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu then dropped
himself flat to the floor. Amidst the discouraging atmosphere of being
motionless, the visitor, clearly clad in an unusual atmosphere, stopped in
front of the cell.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"............."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A silent gaze peered
inside through the small iron-barred window in the entrance door. Then, after
looking straight down and checking out Nozomu's motionless figure, he reached
out his left hand through the gap of the bars.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The palm of his
outstretched hand glowed with magic light.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"~!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, just before the
magic was activated, Nozomu instantly strengthened his whole body and jumped at
the inserted hand.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While the intruder was
startled, Nozomu pulled the hand of the person he had grabbed, masterfully
striking the intruder's elbow and wrist and forcing the magic-imbued palm out
of the prison cell. He proceeded to push the palm toward the intruder's face.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"―――! ~!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Along with the bursting
magic light, a dark green smoke covered the intruder's face. The other party's
body suddenly lost its strength.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Apparently, it was a
paralyzing smoke spell.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu pulled his arm
again, making the intruder lean his body against the door. Then, he reached his
arm through the bars and rummaged around in his pocket. Upon feeling a solid
touch, a key came out.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He then inserted the
key into the keyhole of the door through the window and twisted it. With a
clang, the lock of the cell opened.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He pushed the door
open. While turning the hinge in a half-turn, he pushed the intruder against
the wall using the door itself as a fulcrum, and restrained him. Then, upon
confirming the other party's face, Nozomu involuntarily widened his eyes.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......
Caskell-sensei?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Caskell Matthiart. He
was the homeroom teacher for Nozomu and his classmates in the 10th class until
the second grade.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although sandwiched
between the wall and the door, his gaze was firmly fixed on Nozomu. Apparently,
he is conscious.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, there is
neither emotion nor regret on his face. This is an impossible reaction for a
man who originally came from an aristocratic background and must be very
prideful. Seeing this, Nozomu was convinced of Mefi's intervention.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"He has no
self-awareness. Just like Lisa and those men that Mefi was
manipulating......~!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oi, what are you
doing there!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that moment, a
patrolling guard heard the noise and came at the wrong time.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh,
crap......!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"An escapee!
There's an escapee!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Seeing the open cell
door and Nozomu out in the corridor, the guard shouted loudly, and one by one,
the stationed guards rushed in.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He could not undo
Caskell's restraints now. With his mind being manipulated, he will probably try
to kill Nozomu, no matter who is around. That is exactly what he will do,
without thinking about the damage to the surroundings.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(What do I do, what do
I do?......)</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the worst-case scenario,
the damage would be spread to the guards.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even as Nozomu
hesitated, the guards were rushing toward him......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wait."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A heavy, commanding
voice stopped them.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The guards all turned
around to see a figure with short dark brown hair and a trimmed beard.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was the Chief of
the Arcazam Guards. The one who was in charge of the command.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"He has been
cleared of all charges. He's free to go."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Cleared?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes, that's
right. And take that man into custody. He's a witness in this case."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The guards, under the
Chief's order, restrained the manipulated Caskell with a rope and threw him
directly into the cell in which Nozomu had just been detained. Apparently, the
rope itself is special, because while being restrained, Caskell tried several
times to use magic, but each time the rope glowed and his magic power was
dispersed.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu Bountis.
You come this way. There's someone waiting for you."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Someone
waiting?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Following the Chief's
directions, Nozomu was escorted to the entrance lobby of the Guard's headquarters.
There, Nozomu's homeroom teacher was waiting for him, looking worried. Next to
her was Norn, the school infirmary doctor.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu-ku~~n!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Thank goodness.
Looks like you're all right."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Anri pounced on
Nozomu's figure as he was led into the room, screaming loudly.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Mmpph~~!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tears streaming down
her face and her eyes swollen red, she hugged Nozomu as hard as she could. Her
soft womanly symbols were pressed against his face. A flicker of Qi rose from
her body, perhaps because she was too emotional.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As Nozomu let out a
wail out of the softness, embarrassment, and even more suffocation, the Chief,
who had been watching from a short distance away, opened his mouth.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"They're the ones
who brought the evidence that you're not the culprit."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Come on Anri,
don't trouble him too much."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Norn gently and with a
deft motion, pulled Anri away from Nozomu.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Muu~~~!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Puha! Haa, haa,
haa...... Thank you, Norn-sensei."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Once Nozomu's
breathing had finally calmed down after being released, the Chief of Police
began to explain the situation again.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">First, the murder
charge against Nozomu had been cleared. The reason was that the wound in
Camilla's abdomen was different from the shape of Nozomu's katana, and the
amount of blood on it was much less than speculated.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The Guard is
currently working with the academy to track down Ken Notice. This is because of
the information provided by the academy and the testimony we were able to
obtain from Camilla Vecnose."</span></span></p>

fortunately, she survived. She is now in a hospital affiliated with the
Gloaurum Institute."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's a

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu was relieved to
hear that she was safe. Seeing this, the Chief let out a wry smile.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You are glad
that the person who caused you to fall into a trap is safe, despite the
circumstances, huh? You're quite a good-natured fellow, aren't you?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's what's
good about this boy~~!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Embarrassed by the
lukewarm glances from the two, Nozomu reflexively averted his gaze and
scratched his cheek.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Chief also knew
that Nozomu had a nail-biting battle against Jihad. His smile deepened upon
seeing the boy's appearance, so different from that time, and so much more
appropriate for his age.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"L-Let's get back

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"We need to talk
about that, too. Follow me."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu was brought to
a facility in the administrative district called the Water Tower.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is a facility
consisting of one huge tower and two adjoining square buildings, one large and
one small, at the base of the tower. This sucked up water from underground and
sent it to the above-ground canals that stretched throughout Arcazam.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There are eight of
these facilities, two in each of the four districts of the city, and they were
built using the most advanced technology available in the experimental ritual
magic city of Arcazam.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There are no water
sources in the vicinity of Arcazam to sustain a city of this size.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The nearest river is
the Vein River, but in order to draw water from it, one has to cut through the
forest, which is infested with demonic beasts, and this is impractical.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Without water, people
cannot continue their activities, and for this reason, these infrastructural
functions, including the [Water Tower], were one of the most important
facilities in Arcazam.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Among these
facilities, this huge tower stood out from the rest. Nozomu's eyes widened
involuntarily when he saw the people gathered in front of it.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Everyone......."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu! Thank
goodness, are you hurt?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yo, seems like
you're all right."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There they were,
Irisdina and the rest of Nozomu's friends.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They rushed toward
him. Although he felt embarrassed when they touched his body as if to confirm
that he was okay, at the same time he was relieved to know that they were
concerned about his safety.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, I'm
alright. So......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's been a day
before yesterday. Nozomu Bountis."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu's gaze turned
to Jihad and the others who were waiting behind Irisdina and the others.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Next to him were his
assistant, Inda, and for some reason, Feo.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad's gaze seemed to
have a certain certain conviction in it. Nozomu then turned to Anri, who had
guided him here, and she gave him an apologetic little nod.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That alone convinced
Nozomu that Jihad knew about his secret to some extent.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Right. So how
much did Jihad-sensei know about me?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Roughly as much
as Anri-sensei knows. Unfortunately, we didn't have much time, and our
resources were limited. We've decided to keep it to ourselves because of its
importance."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In other words, he
knows that Nozomu is a Dragon Slayer.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At the same time, he
chose words that would not reveal the secret to the guards passing by, and he
made it clear that the secret would not be made public for now. Although Nozomu
found it difficult to trust his words right now, there was no doubt that
Arcazam would be forced to move with caution when it came to the Dragon Slayer.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Besides, Nozomu has
something to do now. He accepted Jihad's words for the time being and urged him
to proceed.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I appreciate it.
First of all, my objective is to eliminate the parasites that have been nesting
in this city."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Parasites.......
Do you have any idea who is behind Ken?"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad nodded at
Nozomu's question and began to explain the current situation.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">First of all, some
people have been illegally leaking information about Arcazam to the outside
world. This has been a problem since before Arcazam was built, and Ken seems to
be involved with one of these factions.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Is it
Starlight?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, it is just a
part of it. Starlight was originally an intelligence agency owned by Arcazam.
Helping the forces that would harm this city is against the reason for their
operations."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But Camilla said
she was being surveilled by the Starlight......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Quite the
opposite. I found out through investigation that Starlight was taking her
situation into consideration and protecting her in secret. This was also
approved by her maternal family. But the truth is that Ken Notice and his
backers who found this information made her believe she was being monitored and
used it to incite her suspicions."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad then showed
Nozomu the report that Inda had presented to him in his office. The report
certainly had Camilla's name on it as a target for protection.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Why wasn't
Camilla informed of the situation?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"We were
concerned about her strong distrust of others. She was originally so cautious
that she came to Arcazam disguised with magic. The person in charge at the time
thought that there was no need to provoke her and instill distrust in her, so
he planned to formally contact her after she graduated from the school or after
she had settled down after a few years."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This action was done
in consideration of Camilla's character and feelings. However, it backfired.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Also,
Starlight's headquarters was unaware of Ken Notice's true identity. The
information was intentionally concealed along the way. It was Caskell Matthiart
who was responsible for it."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Huh?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"He was also one
of Starlight's Shadows. He is an agent who monitors the academy for any
suspicious students and at the same time carefully examines the information
that comes up and reports it to Starlight's headquarters. But I hear he was
dissatisfied with his life in this city."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Caskell was originally
an Empire aristocrat and a prideful person. For him, it seemed that his
dispatch to Arcazam was not an honor.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"As a result, he
reverted back to the Empire and kept leaking information about his students to
the outside world without their permission to gain status there. The fact that
the intelligence agency failed to notice this is a shortcoming on their part,
as they have very few horizontal connections."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Furthermore, with his
wrongdoings coming to light, Starlight reexamined past reports to investigate
him and those who were linked to him. In addition, they even searched around
with bloodshot eyes for any wrongdoing among their own members.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As for the two Shadows
who attacked you, I checked their appearance, and they are not members of the
Starlight. They were probably a group of outsiders who had infiltrated from
outside the city. The claim that they are members of the Starlight is a bluff
to put Camilla and you into a corner."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The hooded men were
manipulated by Mefi and attacked along with Lisa. Considering the risks
involved in manipulating people within the city, it was certainly reasonable to
think that these men had been brought in from outside the city.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But capturing
Caskell is not the end. He alone cannot keep the existence of the spirits a
secret. There are others who are helping Ken Notice and harming the city."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So you want to
catch Ken and find out who that is?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's right.
Ken Notice is now believed to be hiding within the waterways that stretch
throughout the city."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The figure of Lisa
being manipulated by Mefi flashed through Nozomu's mind. He must find Ken and
that spirit as soon as possible. Jihad, perhaps seeing through his inner
thoughts, urged Nozomu to follow him and headed for the spire inside the Water
Tower.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In front of the
building were two large magic circles, each more than ten meters in diameter.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They were clearly
designed for large-scale ritual magic. The two magic circles were drawn with
different characters and shapes, as if they were for different purposes.
However, both of them had a flat platform on which a stone the size of a
clenched fist was placed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad opened his
mouth, pointing to the magic circle on the ground.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This is a magic
circle to locate Ken Notice's spirit. Through beings of the same nature and its
contractors, we will determine where the source elements of water are
particularly concentrated within the city."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A spirit. At these
words, Nozomu turned his attention to Shina and Razward, who were standing by
his side.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When their eyes met
Nozomu's, they gave a small but firm nod. Apparently, they had already heard
the details from Jihad and agreed to cooperate.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This is a magic
circle to communicate with the search team. This operation will be carried out
simultaneously in each district of the city. This is for deploying the
necessary communication magic. It's still a prototype, but it can be used to
send voices even within the underground canals, and if we limit the target, we
can also share vision through a magic tool."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What about that

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's a curbstone
made with a special processing. It's the key to communication magic. And this
magic will be controlled by you, Tima Lime."</span></span></p>

stone that allows one to share information with another. It was used in the
Special Comprehensive Exercise.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jihad glanced at Tima
this time, and she nodded firmly, though nervously.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Perhaps Ken
Notice is currently with his contracted spirit. Now that he has failed to kill
you, his objective should be to take Lisa Hounds with him and try to escape
from Arcazam."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">According to Jihad,
Ken is already on a wanted list, albeit unofficially, as a suspect in a serious
crime. In other words, he no longer has a place in the city. If caught, he will
be banished from the city and face the appropriate punishment as a criminal.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Now, here's the

clearly, but Nozomu knew the reason why. The other party is a person who has
made a contract with a spirit. Since Shina, who can also communicate with the

handed Nozomu a small earring. A simple, unadorned earring made of brass and

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh no you

magic could be activated, a whip struck Kelpie on the shoulder.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a jolt, Kelpie
glared begrudgingly at Anri, who had interrupted it, and then invoked the magic
that had been on standby. A powerful water blade loomed over her, threatening
to bisect her below the groin.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oopsie~~. That

the water blade by spinning herself around.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Despite her frail
appearance, Anri is a physically skilled woman who specializes in Qi-jutsu. Her
weapon of choice is also a whip, which is out of character for her innocent
appearance. And as a teacher at the Solminati Academy, her ability sets her
apart from her students.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What a rough

strengthened her entire body and unleashed her whip like a gale. The whip,
accelerated by the reinforcement provided by the Qi-jutsu, struck the shoulder
again at a speed that exceeded the dynamic vision of the demonic beast.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"~!?"</span></span></p>

incomparable to the previous one, Kelpie's body was sent flying and slamming
into the side of the canal.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The beast was
momentarily stunned, unable to comprehend what had just happened.</span></span></p>

immediately got up in a fit of rage, and its magic power raged as it growled.</span></span></p>

radiated from the corner of its forehead, spreading to the surface of the
water.</span></span></p>

countless water spears were generated from the surface of the water and shot
out toward Anri. The number of spears was roughly more than 20. That's enough
to turn several soldiers into hedgehogs at once.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Phew!"</span></span></p>

away the rain of water spears. The whip was unleashed at high speed, undulating
like a serpent, and the water spears scattered away.</span></span></p>

at how easily its magic was repelled, and Anri unleashed her whip once again.</span></span></p>

consecutive strikes. The intense shock and pain that hit both shoulders and the
side of the head caused Kelpie to almost collapse into the water. The skin
where it had been hit was torn and blood oozed from the skin. Kelpie's
confusion increased as its own blood dripped onto the surface of the water.</span></span></p>

clear even without understanding the words. Again, Kelpie, angered, further
intensified its magic power.</span></span></p>

beasts approaching from behind to their companions, Nozomu, Irisdina, and Feo
continued to push forward through the intricate network of waterways beneath

the school was due to two factors: his low competence and the bad reputation of
being a cheater. And only one of them could be completely overturned. As long
as the other remains, third parties will always have doubts.</span></span></p>

his superiority was about to collapse, the jealousy that had been building up
over the years, and the fact that he had not been accepted by Lisa. Maybe it's
the result of all of these things piling up......</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......In any

channels through which water flowed from the various districts of the city, and
the entire floor was covered with blocks with several small holes drilled in

arguing. Apparently, taking Lisa to hunt down Nozomu had angered Ken. It was
also confirmed that they were trying to flee outside the city with Lisa.

jumped back. However, as Nozomu escaped from the icicle's trajectory, another
shadow attacked him from the side. Two hooded shadows. In the darkness of the
dimly lit reservoir, a silver flash of murderous intent flashes through the
air.</span></span></p>

Irisdina walked behind Nozomu, who was facing Ken, and knelt down with her
rapier propped up on the floor. Feo, who believed in Nozomu and immediately
took action without question or hesitation, took out talismans, poured magic
power into them, and threw them.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A hexagram was drawn
with Nozomu and Irisdina at the center. This is a magic circle based on the six
basic elements. It is almost the same as the formation used in the practice of
ritual magic at the school.</span></span></p>

face was a mixture of regret and guilt. Nozomu's face, filled with anger
directed at her in the Spasim forest, and the truth she had come to know, were
flooding into her mind.</span></span></p>

looked desperate, Nozomu turned his treasured katana's tip toward himself.
Then, while letting out a wry smile at himself for trying to rely on the most
old-fashioned method in this most technologically advanced city on the Arkmel
Continent, he forcefully thrust the [Mumei] into his own stomach.</span></span></p>

pain in his stomach, but a smile appeared on his face.</span></span></p>

in his training with his master. He knew where he could stab without any
aftereffects. In fact, he had avoided vital organs such as internal organs.</span></span></p>

blade further in closer to the hilt as if seeking a connection with [Mumei].
Blood began to ooze from his belly, turning the blade redder and redder.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Blood is a medium that
has been used in various rituals since ancient times. Moreover, Nozomu, the
wielder of the blade, stabbed [Mumei] into his own body of his own volition.
There is no greater ritual act than this to connect two parties who are forming
a contract.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Once the blade was

the wound, but Nozomu did not bat an eye and instead held the [Mumei] up.</span></span></p>

was prepared for the contract became brighter, and in sync with it, the

the wielder's blood reinforced the links of the two sides, completely dyeing
the ancient demon sword into a form befitting Nozomu.</span></span></p>

pity deepened even more, and while gritting his teeth, he readied his [Mumei]
to slash away the murky torrent of hatred and malice that was closing in on
him.</span></span></p>

waist and lifted his treasured katana in a thrusting stance. He exerted extreme
concentration. He even ignored the intense pain in his gut, and conveyed his
thoughts to his treasured blade.</span></span></p>

his wish, the [Mumei]'s blade shone even more brightly. The blood that was
clinging to the blade was instantly erased, and the chain-like pattern engraved
on the blade dissolved, becoming a ring of shining white chains that wrapped
around it.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Fu~!"</span></span></p>

in a circular motion. It was the same movement as the technique known as the
[Mikagura-style</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">・</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Fan-Sailed Lotus]. It
is a defensive technique that uses a film of Qi generated in the trajectory of
the blade to block the opponent's attack.</span></span></p>

of the technique, rings of chains were scattered in a circular formation
accompanied by light, creating a thin film of light.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Compared to the
oncoming raging murky stream of the source element, it seemed rather unreliable
and insignificant. However, the film of light created by the chain rings
received Ken's spirit magic head-on and did not budge an inch.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-Impossible......."</span></span></p>

receive them. The chainrings began to unilaterally absorb the vast amount of
source elements that were crashing into them. The chainrings, each of which was
only the size of a thumb, swallowed the source element streams that were
thousands or tens of thousands of times greater than their volume.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was an
extraordinary sight, like a huge flood being sucked into a single bucket.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The chainrings, which
were small compared to the scale of spirit magic, absorbed all the magic that
came into contact with them and immediately went back to [Mumei]'s blade,
dyeing it blue.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was undoubtedly the
power of the spirit magic that Ken had just unleashed. Nozomu's sharp gaze was
directed at Ken, who was stunned.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He then swung his
blade, which had been infused with spirit magic, with all his might.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Immediately afterward,
as if in reverse, the source stream of water elements was fired back at Ken.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The muddy stream
knocked Ken flying and plunged directly into one of the underground waterways.
The outer circumference of the waterway was instantly gouged out, and the
surrounding ground was excavated. It expanded the width of the canal to more
than twice its original width before finally receding after a few hundred
meters.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Gah, ugh!?"</span></span></p>

away, crashed into the ground several times, and finally stopped when he was
blasted away about 30 meters. Immediately after that, *shatter!*, a shattering
sound echoed behind Nozomu's ears. The link he had just established with
[Mumei] was broken.</span></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Phew......"</span></span></p>

had been emitting light, became completely silent. Nozomu regulated his
breathing and slowly sheathed it back to its scabbard.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The reflected spirit
magic was shot into the waterway to avoid causing the inside of the reservoir
to be destroyed by the pressure.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Instead, the waterway
leading to the reservoir was pretty much destroyed, but Nozomu tried his best
not to do any damage to it.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He then reached into
his pouch and used medicine to stop the bleeding to the very minimum.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Meanwhile, Ken, whose
entire body had been repeatedly slammed into the hard blocks, stared at Nozomu
with eyes that seemed to see something unbelievable as he endured the pain that
ran through his entire body.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But his amazement was
soon painted over by anger and frustration.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Not yet, I
haven't lost yet!</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"> He could not even accept the defeat that had been
thrust upon him, and like a child throwing a tantrum, he tried to resist using
his partner's power once again.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Stop. I'm done~~!]</span></span></p>

unilaterally broke the assimilation.</span></span></p>

figure glowed, and the little girl unraveled and transformed into another form.</span></span></p>

insect with large compound eyes and a proboscis. The only thing it had in
common with its previous form was its translucent wings. It was Mefi's original
form that emerged from the Cracked-Crown Giant Centipede that Nozomu and his
friends had seen a few weeks before.</span></span></p>

Mefi, who has returned to her little girl form, sneered at him again.</span></span></p>

betraying the person she had been with for nearly a decade and then innocently
sneering at him was repulsive and, at the same time, extremely disgusting,
partly because of the discrepancy from the innocent girl she had been until a
moment before.</span></span></p>

any further. As Irisdina and the others were about to step in with frowns on
their faces, Mefi pointed her right hand to the ceiling. There, a crimson
sphere was suspended.</span></span></p>

she up to? While Nozomu and the others were preparing themselves, the clots of
blood were dissolving and fading away.</span></span></p>

that, *shud!*, with a gut-wrenching vibration, some of the blocks on the floor
shattered, and large amounts of water spurted out from multiple locations like
a geyser.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At the same time, a

face contorted hideously, Mefi quickly jumped into the canal where the loudest
noise was coming from. Instantly, a huge volume of water rushed into the
reservoir from the canal Mefi had jumped into.</span></span></p>

Originally, it was a restraining magic to bind the opponent's movements with

looked at Nozomu, who was desperately trying to save the man who had betrayed
him, with a somewhat distant look in his eyes, and then he opened his mouth.</span></span></p>

Nozomu's hand with all his might. His face contorted in self-pity and the fear

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nozomu yelled, but it
was too late. He had already been swept away into the depths of the dark canal.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"My hands, are
already-......"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And Irisdina was also
at her limit. Fatigue and impatience were eating away at her spirit and body,
and the [Chain of Darkness] began to dissipate. Her grip began to weaken, and
the magic that strengthened her body was slowly losing its effectiveness.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">I cannot drag
Irisdina into this mess because of my own selfishness</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">. Nozomu silently put
his blade against the [Chain of Darkness].</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu, what are
you-...... stop!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Irisdina, realizing
his intention, let out a cry akin to a shriek. Her consciousness was distracted
for a moment, and then the chain slipped from her hand.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(Crap......!)</span></span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that moment, a hand
from the side grabbed the [Chain of Darkness], which was about to disappear
into the water, in the nick of time.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Lisa-kun......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was Lisa who
grabbed the [Chain of Darkness]. She yanked on the chain with all her might and
pulled Nozomu up the stairs.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa, haa, Lisa,
thank you."</span></span></p>

umm......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When Nozomu thanked
Lisa for her help, she was involuntarily flustered. Because she knew that
normally she would not be thanked.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Guys, hurry
up!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Feo's words brought
Nozomu and the others back to their senses, and they began rushing up the
stairs.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While they were doing
so, the water was accumulating at an ever-increasing rate.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When they reached the
door at the top of the reservoir, Nozomu and the others kicked open the door
and jumped straight into the connecting tunnel.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[At the end of the
tunnel, there is an exit from the water supply to the surface. Hurry!]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Urged by Jihad's
words, Nozomu and the others run through the tunnel.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jihad-sensei,
what about the others!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[They've already
escaped. You are the last ones!]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When they reached the
upper canal, they found the ladder leading to the surface in the tunnel right
next to it.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Feo, you go up
first and lift the lid, Iris, Lisa, sorry, but can you help me pull these two
up!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Got it!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Y-Yes......!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Feo went ahead to open
the lid and get on the surface. Irisdina and Lisa followed, carrying the two
unconscious intruders on their backs, respectively, and began to climb the
ladder.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[The reservoir is
full, but the water keeps pouring in! Get to the surface now, the flash flood
is coming!]</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just as Lisa handed
over the intruder on her back to Feo, a report of imminent danger came in,
causing Nozomu and the others to turn pale. If a volume of water that could
fill that huge reservoir in a matter of minutes flooded this narrow tunnel, its
force would be incomparable to before.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As Nozomu reflexively
turned his eyes toward the tunnel they had come running from, *whoosh!*, a
strong gust of wind blew out. Water was already rushing through the tunnel.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu, you are
the last one, hurry up!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even before Feo could
finish his sentence, Nozomu already jumped on the ladder and started to climb
up.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The wooden ladder
creaked as he climbed each step. His heart was beating fast at the sound of the
steps on which his hands and feet rested. There was still time. Four more steps
and he would be on the surface.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Whoa......!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But just as he was
about to reach the surface, tragedy struck. The ladder's support snapped with a
loud snapping sound.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps it had rotted
due to moisture. Furthermore, the mortar connecting the ladder to the inner
wall peeled off due to the shock. Nozomu fell down the ladder into the canal.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ugh......."</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To make matters worse,
the wound in Nozomu's stomach, which had been sealed, was now completely open
due to the impact.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even as new blood
spilled from his belly, Nozomu managed to jump to the remaining ladder, but the
pain in his abdomen made him fall to his knees.</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nozomu, don't
move! I'm coming down now-......"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't come! I'm
not going to make it!"</span></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In her impatience,
Irisdina tried to descend into the canal again, but Nozomu's desperate voice
stopped her from doing so.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Instantly after that,
a flash flood spewed out from the connecting tunnel and swallowed Nozomu right
in front of Irisdina and the others who were trying to save him.</span></span></p>
