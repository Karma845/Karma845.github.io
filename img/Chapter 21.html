<h3>Chapter 21 &#8211; Star☆Mines' Lunch</h3>

<div class="calibre3">Lunch break period. As planned, I change into my sports shoes and go to the back of the old school building.</div><div class="calibre3">It's sunny and breezy. There is also a shady tree, so even if the sun is strong, it won't be a problem.</div><div class="calibre3">Also, not only students but even teachers don't come to this place. So we can feel safe to have a meet.</div><div class="calibre3">The only disadvantage is that it may take five to ten minutes to come from the classroom.</div><div class="calibre3">"Kazu-kun! Over here!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">I'm called by Kurumizaka-san, who is sitting on a picnic mat in the shade of a tree.</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka and Kiyokawa, who have already arrived, are also sitting on it.</div><div class="calibre3">"Thanks for waiting." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji. Did anyone happen to see you on the way here?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I guess someone did, but I don't think they will come to any idea of this meeting." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">When I get to their place, I take off my shoes and sit on the picnic mat. I sit down next to Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">For some reason...... I'm starting to get nervous.</div><div class="calibre3">I think I'm probably the only guy in the world who's ever been to have lunch together with three popular idols.</div><div class="calibre3">Now that all of us are here, we start our lunch and talk in moderation.</div><div class="calibre3">For my lunch, Rinka has prepared it for me.</div><div class="calibre3">The lunchbox that is spread in front of me is filled with standard side dishes such as omelet and sausage salad.</div><div class="calibre3">"Kazuto-kun. Ahmm." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"E, emm..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Here, open your mouth." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka picks up an omelet with her chopsticks and holds it out to my mouth.</div><div class="calibre3">Naturally, I'm being watched by a somewhat smiling Kurumizaka-san and Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">"You guys sure are very impassioned, yes! Kazu-kun and Rin-chan are madly lovebirds, aren't they!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"They were going to be an idiot couple sooner or later....... No, they were already a husband-wife." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kurumizaka-san and Kiyokawa each give their own impressions. Say whatever you want.......</div><div class="calibre3">"What's the matter, Kazuto-kun? Do you not want to eat my omelet?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, it's not like that......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ahmmm." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div>
<div class="calibre3">"Hello~ I am Bujangga from pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id"</div>
<div class="calibre3">I push my embarrassment to the back of my mind and with "Ahmmm" I have the omelet she has held it out to me.</div><div class="calibre3">I am so happy and embarrassed that I can't even taste it.</div><div class="calibre3">"Is it good?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's good." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see, I'm glad." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka lets out a sigh of relief. My face is now on fire, though.</div><div class="calibre3">As for Kurumizaka-san and Kiyokawa, they who are watching our doing are now giggling......</div><div class="calibre3">"You're so lucky, Rin-chan. I wish I had a boyfriend like Kazu-kun." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Unfortunately, but Kazuto-kun is my husband. I'm not going to give up my position as his wife, even if it is to Nana, okay." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ahaha......." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3"><div class="calibre3">Kurumizaka-san lets out a bitter laugh at Rinka's imposing declaration.</div><div class="calibre3">But the way Rinka puts it, she will tolerate anything except the wife position. Or, am I just overthinking this?</div><div class="calibre3">"I, too, am sometimes spoken to by boys, but...... I'm a little afraid of them." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Why so?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Because their eyes are kind of glaring....... Also, their line of sights are focused at my bre*sts a lot." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"You are not going to stare at my bre*sts, are you, Kazu-kun?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"What I have to reply. I guess I'm just not so much paying attention to them." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Since I started going out with Rinka, I feel like I've lost interest in girls other than Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">In the past, I would have been more or less curious about a girl's bre*sts, but now I simply don't care.</div><div class="calibre3">"So, Senior Ayanokouji, did you prefer small-bre*sted girl?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's not quite right. If anything, each size has――――eh, what are you trying to get me to say?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... No one asked that much, either." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">The girls are looking at me coldly and suspiciously.</div><div class="calibre3">I feel a faint but thrilling sensation run down my spine. I think I might have gone through the path of an M.</div><div class="calibre3">"Kazuto-kun. What do you think of mine?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"I love Rinka's, no matter they are big or small. I'm not interested in any other than the one belonging to Rinka." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"......Kazu-kun, sometimes you talk just like a pervert. don't you?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">Kurumizaka-san gives me a scornful stare.</div><div class="calibre3">Then what should I have answered?</div><div class="calibre3">If I answer that I like big, the big-bre*sted Kurumizaka-san will have a strange thought of me, the same case will happen if I answer that I like small-bre*st, Kiyokawa will say something.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm screwed up...... as soon as the topic of bre*sts comes up, my grave has been dug.</div><div class="calibre3">It's a mistake to talk about bre*sts with girls in the first place.</div>
<div class="calibre3">"Hello~ I am Bujangga from pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id"</div>
<div class="calibre3">"Oh, I got my hands dirty." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">The sauce from the mini hamburgers gets on her right hand, and Rinka raises a troubled voice.</div><div class="calibre3">"Had no worry, Senior Rinka. I had prepared wet wipes just in case something like this happened." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Immediately, Kiyokawa hands a small bag of wet wipes to Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">"Thank you Ayane, this is very helpful." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, I dropped my chopsticks! What should I do?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Let me handle it, Senior Nana. I also had prepared disposable chopsticks just in case something like this happened." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Thank you, Ayane-chan!" (Nana)</div>
<div class="calibre3">"Hello~ I am Bujangga from pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id"</div>
<div class="calibre3">Kurumizaka-san receives disposable chopsticks from Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">.......</div><div class="calibre3">After watching the girls, I decided to try something.</div><div class="calibre3">"Oh no, my smartphone's about to run out of power." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Leave it to me, Senior Ayanokouji. I have a power bank here." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Th, this is great!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I receive the power bank from Kiyokawa and exclaim.</div><div class="calibre3">"?? What was wrong?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Nothing, it's just you're too well prepared, Kiyokawa-san! From where are you taking all these pieces of stuff out?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"They were from this pouch. I always kept a variety of stuff in it to prepare for every eventuality." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">What Kiyokawa shows me then is a rectangular pouch. It's plain white. <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5">(PTW/N: Now she's Ayanemon.)</i></b></div><div class="calibre3">"I had also prepared a trash bag." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">She also takes out a small trash bag and shows it to me. You're way too considerate.</div><div class="calibre3">"What else is in the pouch?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Bandages, handkerchiefs......, and a playing card in case we get stuck for topics." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Th, that's amazing." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ehehe, our Ayane-chan is amazing, isn't she? She is so helpful to us in so many ways." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">Kurumizaka-san proudly boasts about her. But she has a tiny bit of potato salad on her mouth. Noticing this, Kiyokawa says, "Senior Nana. Excuse me", and wiping it off with a handkerchief.</div><div class="calibre3">Kurumizaka-san and Rinka accept Kiyokawa's action as a matter of course, without any complaint. I guess this is their everyday life.</div><div class="calibre3">So this is what Star☆Mines.</div><div class="calibre3">With that in mind, I take a mouthful of white rice, chew it, and swallow it.</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji, you couldn't do that. You had to chew it a little more before you swallowed it. It was not good for your health, did you know it?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, yes. I'm very sorry." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">She warns me and so I bow my head.</div><div class="calibre3">She is definitely a kind of caring person with a lot of nitpicking.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't mind it, though, but it might be annoying to some people.</div><div class="calibre3">"Speaking of which, Ayane-chan, is there anyone you like?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Wh-what did you just ask out of the blue." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I've been looking at Rin-chan and Kazu-kun and thinking how nice it is to have a boyfriend. So, I'm wondering if Ayane has one or not." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa, who is startled by the sudden question, looks downcast with reddened cheeks and replies with a murmur.</div><div class="calibre3">"Th-there was...... There was a person...... I liked." (Ayane)</div></div>
