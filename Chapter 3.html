<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 3: The A Shady Business, Secret Training, and a Glimmering Sense of Unrest</h2>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A boring afternoon, a
boring class.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even for Jin, who had
never lived a proper school life, the basic history lecture did not feel
refreshing.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">More than 30 years
ago, our beloved country continued to expand its territory aimlessly through
imperialism, which was considered old-fashioned even at that time. Eventually,
as the war budget ran out and it became difficult to maintain the war's front
lines, which had spread thoughtlessly, the empire began to be overrun by the
Republic, which boasted the most advanced science and technology.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When a new bomb
dropped on the capital and killed a large number of innocent people, the upper
echelons of the empire finally signed a written declaration of surrender.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A year later,
you psychics suddenly appeared in the devastated empire."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The instructor, Rudy,
concluded with a stifled yawn and turned to the next page of his textbook with
a somber expression on his face.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Heiberg National
Academy for the Psychics is an extremely competition-oriented society with an
emphasis on real-world competition. It may not be a bad thing that they don't
put much effort into classroom learning, but being subjected to endless
lectures about common knowledge that everyone already knows is almost like
torture. In the first place, in the month and a half since they entered the
school, they have only learned a short history of psychics since they first
appeared.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Moreover, Rudy, who
delivers the lectures in a tedious manner, is a close collaborator of Jin and
Nina. Thanks to his help in falsifying the reports, they are able to pass the
&lt;ability measurement&gt;, in which they have to show the degree of growth of
their abilities in front of the instructor every month.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Therefore, Jin is
never criticized for not taking his classes seriously.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin plopped down on
his desk and pretended to be asleep while thinking back to the conversation he
eavesdropped on this morning.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In order to reply to
Karen about the alliance, Nina went to the woods behind the first girls'
dormitory. To get a better idea of the characteristics of the person he was
about to deceive, he had Nina carry a listening device.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[...... So you come,
Stingray. Can I hear your reply?]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her tone was clear and
direct.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The fact that she
suddenly tried to get right to the point at the very first word showed how
intuitive and highly self-confident her personality was. And the fact that she
stubbornly referred to her negotiation partner by the family name indicated
that she was cautious and wanted to draw a line between her and the other
party. Although she never uttered a word until the very end, according to Nina,
Karen seemed to have brought along her maid, Satya, as well.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Normally, it would be
best not to target these types of people for fraud.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Before we form an
alliance, there are a few things I want to make sure of.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As instructed in
advance, Nina stated so.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[One is about how to
distribute the points after defeating Casper-san.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Since I'm the one who
actually fights him, 30% should be enough, right?]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Always trying to gain
an advantage over the other party is a trait closely tied to someone with a
high level of competitive spirit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[How long do you want
the alliance to last?]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Until we destroy that
idiot, of course. After that, the alliance will become invalid. The next person
I'm going to target might as well be you.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[I like your
straightforwardness. I feel more at ease that way.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin smiled wryly at
Karen's insistence on provoking the other party at every turn.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, the fact that
she was so careful suggests that she has no intention of betraying Nina, at
least not until the alliance is broken.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Now, one last thing.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Here, Jin had Nina
plant a slow-acting poison.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[From now on, when we
are going to meet, I would like to specify a place. It should be indoors, with
no pedestrians around and preferably without windows, so that I don't have to
worry about being watched with a telescope from afar.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Of course, we must
not allow anyone to know about our alliance, but ...... do we have to go that
far?]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[I got influenced by
my brothers who are in the &lt;White Knights&gt;, I guess. Uninvited rats are
lurking everywhere, you know. ...... Well, it's just a precaution.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[I see your point, but
I don't like the idea of using such a place you've designated. So I'll let
Satya find a suitable place for us, is that okay?]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[...... Yes, that's
fine.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As if to say that her
business was finished, Karen quickly left the place along with her maid Satya.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">It is somewhat
unusual for a spy who is required to act in secrecy to be so aggressive, but it
is possible that this is also calculated to keep her connection to the academy
from being known. As long as she is always seeking trouble and starting
&lt;duel&gt; on a regular basis, she would not be prone to any unnecessary
suspicion when it comes time to eliminate the academy's enemies.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">In that sense,
this alliance is a very clever move of her. She would be able to eliminate
Casper, whose behavior is suspicious, and at the same time, investigate Nina.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">However, there
is only so much information that can be gleaned from the muffled audio. With
the current cards I have, it is difficult to determine that Karen is the
&lt;shepherd's dog&gt;.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">I guess this
big job will take a lot more time.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jin-kun. Good
morning~, class is over, you know?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma tapped Jin on the
shoulder, and he gave her a blatantly sour look.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I was not
sleeping. I was just thinking."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hee, what were
you thinking about?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I was thinking
about how wonderful love is, how precious life is, and stuff like that."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I can't believe
it if you said it with such a straight face......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You too, Emma,
you were looking unusually gloomy today, you know that? Did something
happen?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh, I'm
surprised you noticed. Actually, my friend Kate has been expelled from school."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No way, that's
terrible."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was a half-hearted
response, even for Jin.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina, who was packing
her stuff next to Emma, was also looking at her with a dumbfounded gaze.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The girl named Kate is
actually Nina Stingray, disguised in a wig and contact lenses. It was just a
temporary face that she was using to manipulate information.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her disguise and
acting skills are astonishing, at a level that even Emma, who is usually with
Nina, cannot recognize, but Kate cannot be allowed to exist indefinitely.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To begin with, Kate is
a student who does not exist on paper, and there is a limitation that she
cannot physically appear when Nina is present. Whenever the time came for
classmates' names and faces to be identified, Kate would be exposed, so the
only way was to spread the rumor that she had voluntarily dropped out of the
school.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, they also
have prepared new units such as [Margot] and [Aria] as intelligence agents, but
just to be safe, they won't allow Emma to see them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This academy is
really a tough place, huh......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It doesn't
necessarily mean that all the students who dropped out of the school are
unhappy. Apparently, once we lose our memories of this place, we can transfer
to a private training school, and if we give up our dream of becoming a member
of the &lt;White Knights&gt;, we can get a good-paying job."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I see, that's
true! I hope Kate-chan is doing well."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even the stone-hearted
Jin is beginning to worry, wondering if this girl will really be all right.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even though she has
the psychic ability to enhance her physical abilities, which is easy to use, it
may be difficult for her to succeed at the Heiberg Academy if she is this pure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Suddenly, Jin recalled
the line he previously said to Nina.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">There is nothing more dangerous in this world than a
seemingly harmless fraudster.</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">If Emma is a
&lt;shepherd's dog&gt; and she is approaching us to find out how dangerous we
are, then she is a very skilled fraudster.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Not only Jin, who has
been distrustful of people since childhood, but also Nina, who is a first-rate
actress, could not pull it off.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">How could it be
possible for someone to have been with Jin for such a long time and not show
the slightest error in their acting?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......By the
way, Emma. Why are you wearing gym clothes all by yourself?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, I mistook
the timetable for tomorrow...... You see, tomorrow is physical training from
the first period, right?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Unbelievable,
such a classic mistake!?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jin-kun, please
don't tell anyone, it's embarrassing."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The character portrayed
by the task required of &lt;shepherd's dog&gt; is that of a perfectionist whose
character is meticulous and careful, and who never leaves any stone unturned.
Unless one is a monster like Nina, human nature will ooze out, even if one is
performing an act a little bit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In all likelihood,
Emma does not fit that profile.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Well, I should be cautious, just in case.</span></i></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Two Weeks Later</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps the most
distressing scam that Jin and his foster father, Rusty, committed was the one
targeting Christopher Tsung, who was a senator at the time.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When Tsung visited his
villa with his wife, Rusty and Jin approached him, pretending to be a father
and son who were on vacation in a neighboring villa. The owner of the villa was
on vacation abroad, and Rusty had rented everything including his wife and his
dog from a company specializing in impersonation, so it was impossible to
arouse suspicion.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The first step was to
create a situation where they would happen to pass each other every day and
greet each other while Tsung was on his daily running routine. This strategy
aimed for a simple contact effect, and Tsung gradually began to open up to them
as they saw each other again and again. Since his son Jin was also with him, it
was really easy to get him to let his guard down.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When the time was
right, Rusty invited Tsung and his family to a home party, where he revealed to
them that he had a psychic ability to predict the future.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He used a technique
similar to the &lt;psychic frauds&gt; of the old days.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">By using several
tricks to convince them of his abilities, Rusty was able to successfully sign
the advisory contract. Over the next six months, Rusty successfully won Tsung's
trust, and he swindled Tsung out of a total of 200 million El in the form of
consultation fees and various other expenses.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If there were a
textbook in the world of fraudsters, Rusty's work would be the first subject to
be included in it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that time, Rusty
was laughing as he tapped the stack of bills on the table. Jin remembered he
was in such a good mood that he had emptied a bottle of expensive liquor in
just one hour, which he had received from a foreign friend he had recently met.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What's the
matter, Jin? Why don't you be more excited like a kid of your age?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You're too
excited. A fraudster should never let his guard down, right?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">"You don't
understand, huh..." Rusty said, giving Jin a flaccid smile, as if he were
comforting a child. "</span><span lang="EN-US"> </span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">When you succeed in a
big job, be happy about it. That's one of the golden rules of being a
fraudster."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"And why is
that?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Because being a
fraudster is a job where you have to give people hope."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For a moment, Rusty's
eyes took on a serious color.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At a moment like this,
he was trying to tell Jin something important.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If you want to
convince a pathetic fool that [I can dream if I follow this guy], you can't
have a grim look on your face. It's better to be confident all the time, and to
have the illusion that everything in the world is on your side. It's not an
act, it's not a bluff, you have to feel that way from the bottom of your
heart."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Isn't that a
very difficult thing to do?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's why you
should accumulate success experiences from now on. We wouldn't have gotten this
200 million els without you, you know?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I was just there
though?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Listen
Jin, you should puff out your chest more. We are invincible."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Not knowing how to
laugh, Jin sipped at his yet-to-be-drunk liquor.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was a perfect
moment, he thought.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A night of intense
accomplishment, a full-body experience of joy, and a small room filled with the
light of hope. Jin thought that such a happy night would last forever.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The only
miscalculation was that Tsung, who had trusted Rusty too much, had revealed
important government secrets to him.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As a result, Rusty was
hunted by the &lt;White Knights&gt; and eventually captured and tortured to
death.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">The risks involved in getting into the hearts and
minds of the enemy and winning their trust are unimaginable.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The difficulty level
of the scam that Jin and Nina will now attempt will surely far surpass that
time.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin lies down on the
mat at the back of the gym and plays with the counterfeit coins with his
fingertips.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Unlike last time, when
all he had to do was frame Bennett, this case had too many uncertainties.
First, he must tread carefully and find a path to victory.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina seemed to have
arrived five minutes before the appointed time.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sound of the door
being opened with a duplicate key that Jin had a contractor he was acquainted
with make.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Anyone
tailing you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No problem. I
detoured along the proper route as you told me, but no one followed me."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Okay, let's
start the strategy meeting."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin opened the locker
containing the cleaning tools and took out a bamboo broom from inside. He piled
up the crates that had been placed haphazardly and climbed up onto them, then
pushed up the wooden ceiling with the handle of the upside-down bamboo broom.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The one-meter square
wooden plank slid off, and the sound of some kind of mechanism working could be
heard echoing in the ceiling. A few moments later, a rope ladder descended from
the hole in the ceiling.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Then, I'll go up
first."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-Wait a
minute!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was impossible for
Nina to overlook such an unusual situation.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-When did you
make these renovations? This is the school's facility, after all!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It was completed
last night. It's a completely unused warehouse, so it's up to us to decide how
we want to use it."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-I never even
thought of that......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If we don't
prepare a hidden room, we won't be able to avoid the risk of meeting someone
who happens to be visiting the warehouse. And there's also the possibility that
we're being marked by the &lt;shepherd's dog&gt;, no? We need at least this
level of precaution."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even if it were
necessary, only Jin would be able to really carry it out.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was probably
constructed by Gasta and his team of landscapers, but Nina did not even want to
imagine how much it must have cost.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Come on, how
long are you going to stay still? Or are you afraid of heights?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Y-You're making
fun of me again!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After Jin, Nina also
managed to climb up the unstable rope ladder.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She wondered what kind
of secret base was spread out ahead of her as she climbed up, but at first
glance, it was no different from an ordinary attic.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, it's rather
anticlimactic, isn't it?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Y-Yeah. It looks
normal for a place that has been carefully constructed......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If we made it so
obvious and then someone were to enter here, we'd be screwed in a heartbeat.
That's why, all the necessary equipment is cleverly hidden."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin took out an iron
ruler from the pocket of his uniform and inserted it into the gap between the
floorboards. Using it as a lever, he removed the floorboards to reveal a number
of hidden equipment.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There are
several of these hidden compartments in this attic. I'll show you where they
are later, so you can hide your disguise gear there. It's safer than your room
in the dorm."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wow, that's
convenient......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina seemed to have
already accepted the whole situation. While she was exploring the place, Jin
was sticking imitation papers that he had taken out of the hidden storage on
the wall.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">On the imitation
papers, black-and-white photographs of people and sticky notes are neatly
pasted. The imitation papers themselves were also scrawled with notes, arrows,
and other symbols. This would allow them to visually organize a complex
operation.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Now then, Nina.
It's been two weeks since you formed an alliance with the two targets...... so
let's summarize your progress."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Casper
and I have been having regular weekly meetings at the same café we were at back
then. As you've heard through the wire, there's been no useful information at
all."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, you guys
have been doing nothing but small talk ...... The only thing I could learn
about him is what his hobbies are on his days off. Well, it could not be used
as a potential breakthrough, though."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin put a sticky note
next to a photo and wrote Casper's hobbies on it in bullet points.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Okay, next is
Karen ....... You haven't had any contact with her since then, have you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah. She's been
busy with &lt;duels&gt;, so she had her maid, Satya, handle her communication
with me."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Satya is an
important person", Jin put another sticky note on the wall.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey Jin, which
one do you think is more suspicious at the moment?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, I think
both of them. Their every action is too unnatural."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin continued,
pointing with a pen to a sticky note that had been pasted beforehand.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"First is Casper.
He's been acting like a harmless guy for a while. The reason he's going out of
his way to say that he's not aiming for the &lt;White Knights&gt; is a bluff to
make us believe that he's not working for the school. The reason for forming an
alliance is clearly an excuse to get close to you Nina, and the fact that he's
approaching girls with no regard could be seen as part of his espionage
activities."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Now that you
mention it, he also tried to get his hands on Satya ......."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If he's the
&lt;shepherd's dog&gt;, it seems natural that he'd want to keep an eye on
Karen, who's been very conspicuous at the academy."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Right, also
Casper's abilities are still [unknown]. Couldn't you ask Rudy-sensei
instead?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"At Casper's
request, the results of the &lt;ability measurement&gt; are not to be shared
with anyone other than the instructor in charge of the test. I'm sure the
higher-ups of the academy are aware of his abilities, but I can't dig that kind
of information out of them."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh, he's getting
some kind of special treatment, isn't he? That's suspicious....... So what
about Karen? How would you interpret the fact that she hasn't contacted me at all?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's risky to go
out of your way to contact her and get information out of her. Especially if
she is the &lt;shepherd's dog&gt; with a huge secret of her own."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"And also,
Karen's reasons for wanting to form an alliance were a little strange."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I agree. It's
unusual for a combat fanatic like her to even think about joining forces with
anyone."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, she
doesn't seem like the type who would try to scheme like that."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, it's
possible that her usual behavior itself is an act."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I see. ......
eh?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina noticed a note
pinned to a piece of imitation paper, and she couldn't help but speak up.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Could that
be...... Satya's psychic ability?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Your doubts are
spot on, Nina. She's not at the level that would normally be allowed to enroll
at the Heiberg Academy."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">An ability called
&lt;Inexplicable Heat Source&gt; that can heat up a cupful of liquid at will.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although it may have
some offensive power if heated to the point of boiling, it would not be
surprising if the Heiberg Academy, which places emphasis on actual combat,
eliminated her from the entrance examination. It is unnatural that she was not
even present at the &lt;screening test&gt; that Jin was forced to take part in.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It means that
Karen's family has enough power to force a maid with only minor abilities to
enter the school."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ugh, she is
suspicious as well, huh......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There's no end
to the suspicions. In any case, you should only think about gaining their trust
and getting into their pockets."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"B-By the
way", Nina stared at the edge of the imitation paper. "Why is Emma's
picture in here?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, it's just
a precaution. It's not that I seriously doubt her......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the middle of his
sentence, the sound of the plank being dislodged from under his feet rang out.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The mechanism had been
activated and the rope ladder was being lowered down to the lower floor.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina covered her mouth
with her hand and her eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't tell me,
the &lt;shepherd's dog&gt; sniffed this place out ......."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The man who climbed up
the rope ladder was a man in his early thirties, blonde hair, blue eyes, and a
man who could be found anywhere.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But he was dressed in
the same military uniform as the instructors.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-What should we
do, Jin? Isn't this bad? ......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, don't worry.
He's a colleague of mine."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eehh......?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The man dressed as an
instructor smiled cheerfully as he retrieved the rope ladder to the attic.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's been a
while, little genius fraudster. Has it been five years since we've seen each
other?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm not a kid
anymore, Mr. Heath. And could you please stop wearing such confusing
outfits?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">"There's no way
outsiders can walk around the school grounds unnoticed, is there?</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">　</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">It's best to disguise myself as an instructor."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wait a second,
please explain! Who is this person?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina was finally able
to interject, and Jin nonchalantly explained to her.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"He's a skilled
detective, specializing in the underworld. He is the one who investigated
Bennett's background last time."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Your shady
connections triggered once again......."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I've requested a
background check on Karen and Casper. Have you completed it yet?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Heath, the detective,
pulled a brown envelope from his pocket and tossed it to Jin.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This is a midway
report. I just wanted to come by and see you for the first time in a
while."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I wish I could
ask this to all of you, but do you think I'm some kind of relative's kid or
something?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The brat who
used to stick with Rusty-san is now a big villain who picks fights with the
empire. Isn't it natural that people would want to come and see if he's grown
into a great man?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Several of Rusty's
former business associates, with whom Rusty had a close relationship of trust,
have been cooperating with Jin for a fee after learning of his goals and the
existence of the &lt;shepherd's dog&gt;.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Like Gasta, the
landscaper, he does not take on work for free just because he is the son of a
benefactor, perhaps out of respect for Jin, who has grown up to be a first-rate
fraudster.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......So, what's
the result of your investigation?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When Jin cut to the
chase to hide his irritation, Heath finally began to explain.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There wasn't a
lot of information about Casper Crawford. As written there, on his days off
he's either dating girls or playing his recently purchased guitar in his room.
......The interesting one is Karen Ashby."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What kind of
information have you uncovered?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Karen always
goes out on her days off to the town of Akkas, at the foot of the academy.
There, she diligently attends a dojo that teaches something called &lt;Eastern
Breathing Techniques&gt;."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That
cautious-looking girl goes to such a shady dojo? Are you sure it's not just a
rumor?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In contrast to Jin,
who was looking at her negatively, Nina was thinking about it with her hand on
her chin.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Breathing
techniques, huh....... It certainly is possible."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nina, what do
you mean?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Sometimes it
takes a great deal of concentration to activate a powerful psychic ability. You
see, I also have a setting that allows me to release my abilities by removing
my brooch, right? The best way to quickly bring your concentration to the
highest level is to have your body memorize a specific routine. That is exactly
why I think breathing techniques would be the best option."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina, who has been
playing the role of a psychic for a long time, has also mastered a whole range
of knowledge on the control and application of psychic abilities. In this
field, she is clearly far ahead of Jin.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You see, Karen's
psychic abilities seem even more difficult to control than my &lt;Queen of
Calamity&gt;, don't you think? I wouldn't be surprised if she practiced
breathing techniques."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I see...... So
should we infiltrate that dojo and get close to Karen?</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As if waiting for Jin
to come to that conclusion, the detective contorted the edges of his mouth.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"And Jin, I have
one more piece of information for you."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hee, let's hear
it."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The name of the
master of the dojo is Nathan Arcollaz."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As soon as Jin heard
this, he laughed out loud. The detective also laughed, holding his stomach.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina, who did not
understand what was so funny, could not help but look at them quizzically.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Really, what a
coincidence. Good job, Mr. Heath."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After a round of
laughter, Jin filled in the details of the operation on a piece of imitation
paper on the wall.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa ...... I
wonder if it's gonna be okay ......."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Basking in the
afternoon sun, Nina walked alone through the Saturday hustle and bustle.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Yesterday, in the
attic operations room, Jin had instructed her to disguise herself as Kate
before coming to the meeting place.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She blended her
imaginary persona into her body and mind, carefully selecting clothing that
Kate, with her red hair and lively personality, would choose, and even
differentiating her walk from her normal self. Looking at her current
appearance, only some genius fraudster would realize that her true identity is
Nina.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Once away from the
main street where the market is located, the area around the market was a quiet
neighborhood lined with brick houses. After walking for about five minutes, and
looking at the map, she finally saw her destination.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A one-story wooden
building, a rare sight in the empire. It must have been modeled after eastern
traditional buildings.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In front of the
majestic gate stood Jin, her accomplice.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What's the
password?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"[Lemon in the
bag]. ......Hey, do we have to bother with this kind of confirmation?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You look like a
different person, so I'm a little skeptical."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When Nina heard that,
she started to feel a little proud of herself. While she was careful not to
show it on her face, Jin handed her a small paper bag that he had taken out
from somewhere.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... What's
this?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well. Your
birthday is coming up, right, Nina?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"My goodness, I
completely forgot that ...... Eh!? Are you giving me a present!?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Aren't you
overreacting?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-What's the
matter, Jin? Did you switch its contents......?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina could not hide
her face from blushing at the unexpected behavior of her accomplice. To
distract herself, she opened the paper bag and found a palm-sized bottle filled
with a pink liquid.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"P-Perfume......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's called
&lt;Glow Citrus&gt;. It's been popular at school lately, right? I just happened
to see it at the market."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Come to think
of it, I've heard this name a lot in class and in the dorms. It has a
refreshing citrus aroma and is relatively affordable and easy to obtain, so
many students are using it.</span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Thank you, Jin,....... I'm happy, so happy ......!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, you see,
smell is one of the most important factors in identifying a person, isn't it?
If you apply this on, it will improve the accuracy of your disguise, and it
seems to fit the character of [Kate] somehow......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, I'll use
it right away!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After looking at Nina,
who was in a good mood and applied the perfume to her wrists and neck, looking
somewhat embarrassed, Jin took out a wire from the hem of his shirt. What kind
of surprise will he show me this time?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Contrary to Nina's
expectations, Jin dexterously used the wire to pry open the lock on the gate.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wait a minute,
Jin!" Nina was instantly snapped back to reality. "Are you trying to
rob someone!?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Shush, you're
being too loud. It's not open for business yet, and I'm just intruding a little
too aggressively."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There's no point
in rephrasing it that way!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Not hearing Nina's
attempts to stop him, Jin kept moving forward.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He crossed the small
garden at the end of the gate and brazenly flung open the entrance door of the
dojo.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Who's that!?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Waiting for the uninvited
visitor was a mature man standing in the center of the wooden floor.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His thin but
well-trained body was wrapped in an all-white robe, and he turned his sharp,
hostile gaze toward them. Since Nina was not clad in her acting persona at this
moment, she was almost overwhelmed by the sheer intensity of the man's
presence.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's okay. You
don't need to be scared of him."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin raised one hand
while grinning.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yo, Nathan. It's
been a while."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"H-How do you
know that name......?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After pondering for a while
as his body stiffened, the man seemed to have come to the worst possible
conclusion.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"D-Don't tell me
you're ...... that guy from Rusty's place......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The momentum of his
first impression was gone, and the man immediately ran toward the back door in
the corner of the dojo.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, the door
would not budge even when he put all his weight on it and pushed.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-Impossible!
Why won't it open......!?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's Kate's
psychic ability here. You'd better give up trying to escape."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, Nina had no
idea what was going on.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin is a fraudster who
will always be carefully prepared for even the slightest lie. Perhaps he had
broken into the dojo grounds and blocked the back door with a piece of wood or
something before meeting up with Nina.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You shitty brat,
what are you doing bringing a heretic with you ......!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I just wanted to
be a good citizen and contribute to society."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Y-You're not
going to sell me out to the cops, are you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, that's one
way to do it. What shall I do, I wonder......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Give me a break!
Please, I beg of you!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nathan folded his
knees and sat down, rubbing his head against the floor and pleaded.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina thought she
remembered reading about this in a book she had read sometime ago. This is a
traditional way of apologizing from a certain country in the East.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For the time being,
she decided to put on Kate's act and listened to the story.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Jin, who
the hell is this guy?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"He's a fraudster
who was very active until a few years ago."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A
fraudster?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A petty crook
who specializes in fraud under the guise of a psychic. He was traveling all
over the empire, making a fortune by claiming to be able to [turn ordinary
people into psychics]."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So, why is he so
scared?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"He just happened
to be our target, so Rusty and I crushed him."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Because of you
guys, I'm wanted all over the country! I even had to get plastic surgery
because of you......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It looks like
you were quite stingy with the surgery expenses. You used to be so handsome, but
now you don't look that way anymore."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey, please let
me off the hook! I'm serious about my business now! If my past gets out, I'll
......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Serious
business? Do you mean dealing in shady products like breathing
techniques?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-I'm just
exploiting a gray zone! All the efficacy claims are vague, and the customers
are only those who can use their psychic abilities from the start! No one will
ever suspect it even if it's not working!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jin, this guy
doesn't seem to have changed at all, though?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Shut your mouth,
heretic! I'm talking to Jin-san right now!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"He gives you an
honorific before I know it......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although she had
become numb to it because she was always with him, the world in which Jin had
lived his entire life was a den of criminals.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If he had been living
in such an environment since his childhood, it was no wonder he had such an
extraordinary mental strength.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nathan, what do
you think would happen if we accidentally slipped up and revealed your true
identity?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-I don't even
want to think about it!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You would be
lucky if it were just the police. Wouldn't it be worse if it were the psychics
that used to be your customers whom you offended? Ah, you even have the famous
Karen Ashby as your customer, right? A~a~, they'll kill you for
sure......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-What do you
want?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It seemed that he was
able to draw out the desired response. The edge of Jin's mouth lifted up
viciously.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If you want to
continue your serious business, take Kate here as your apprentice."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-Is that
it......?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes, that's
it", Jin bent down, his eyes level with the man's. "At least for
now."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina's undercover
mission was set in motion that night.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Dressed in the dōgi
she had received free of charge from her mentor, Nathan, she waited nervously
for Karen to arrive. According to Nathan, Karen would be the only student
today. That means this is a chance for the two of them to get to know each
other.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But if her identity
were to be exposed as Nina Stingray, she would be in big trouble.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the worst-case
scenario, she might be killed on the spot.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Before she knew the
level of Karen's vigilance, she would have to thoroughly eliminate any element
of suspicion. It would be difficult to cover her ears with her hair this time,
so she could not ask for help from Jin via a small transceiver as she had done
in the past.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">It's all right, the conditions are in place.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina shook the bad
thoughts out of her head.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin, who was standing
by nearby, had told her the odds of this operation.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"People are more
likely to open up to someone they meet privately and have no conflict of
interest with than to someone they meet in an official setting, such as school
or work. Especially Karen, who is at the forefront of the fierce competition
for survival at the school."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There's a reason
I chose Kate out of all the personalities. A person like Karen is compatible
with a strong-willed person who can talk to her on an equal footing, but if the
person is on an equal footing, she will turn combative. Since that is the case,
I chose Kate because she is a weak psychic who attends a private academy."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Moreover, the
act of doing this kind of training together creates a sense of solidarity. I
don't know how cautious she is when it comes to meeting new people, but with
your skills, she should be able to open up a lot more by the end of the
training."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A logical explanation
is more persuasive than a hundred words of encouragement. Since she was dealing
with something as uncertain as psychic abilities, Nina wanted only solid ground
to stand on.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In front of the dojo,
she could hear the sound of a car stopping.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Only a few
millionaires would own such a luxury car. Sure enough, getting out of the black
car was Karen Ashby, dressed in dōgi.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well then,
Karen-sama. I will pick you up in two hours."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes,
please."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After exchanging a few
words with the man who appeared to be her driver, Karen stepped into the dojo
with a confident gait.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Master,
who's that girl?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A suspicious look.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A chill ran down her
spine, but Nina managed to hold it in. By their prior agreement, Nathan first
introduced her.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"She's Kate
Lambert, and she'll be joining us today for the breathing exercises. Go on,
introduce yourself."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hi, I'm
Kate."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After a brief
introduction, Nina decided to close the distance at once.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I've heard about
you from Master. You're Karen ......, right? Is it true that you are a student
at the Heiberg Academy?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I have no
intention of getting along with you."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">It won't be easy, after all.......</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina secretly clenched
her fists.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">To deceive the
world from now on, the skill of a fraudster to win the trust of the other party
to get into their pocket is indispensable. I can't afford to stumble at a place
like this.</span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hee, you are
stoic, aren't you Karen? Is that the secret of your strength?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Like I said, I
have no intention of getting along with you......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's okay, I'll
focus once training starts. I'm good at switching on and off, you know."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Suit
yourself."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It will be a long time
before the ice melts, but it doesn't seem to be a complete rejection.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">So far, this is a
success.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps this means
that the deception techniques she learned from Jin have come in handy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What Nina has just put
into practice is the &lt;slide&gt; technique, in which she shifts the subject
so naturally that the other party is unaware of it. Before one knew it, Nina
had nullified Karen's insistence on not talking to her and won her agreement
that she could talk to her if it was between training sessions.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, that was
not the only trick.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina thoroughly
observed Satya, Karen's best friend, and imitated her makeup and her mannerisms
to the extent that they were not unnatural. Since human beings tend to like
similar types of people, this kind of accumulated small details can help lower
Karen's caution on a deep psychological level.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With this, the
preliminary preparations were complete.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">For now, let's
focus on training in the Eastern breathing technique.</span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Then, as I said
before, trace the images in your mind."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nathan, the scammer -
now calling himself "Yakumo" - carefully dropped his words.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina and Karen faced
each other about two meters apart, quietly concentrating.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Imagine that the
air you inhale through your nose for 10 seconds is stored in your
&lt;Tanden&gt;, which is located below your navel. That is the source of your
power. Breathe out for a full 20 seconds, aware of the great power circulating
through your body."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina, who knew
Nathan's past, found this to be very suspicious, but Karen seemed to take it
very seriously.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps she is
actually prone to trusting others.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Today you will
be doing this for the entire hour. Listen, the breathing techniques are just a
starting point. By increasing your mental sensitivity and repeating the
dialogue within yourself, your psychic abilities will be sharpened. Keep that
in mind."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">To think that we'll keep doing this for an hour......</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is a painful
process for Nina, who knows that it is a sham business, but she must not show
such an attitude.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While pretending to be
serious, Nina opened her eyes and observed Karen standing in front of her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was no sign of
violence from Karen now.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Like the shore of a
lake surrounded by fresh greenery, a serenity overflows from her entire body
that seems to allow everything to happen.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Kate, you need
to focus more."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"S-Sorry."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen must have closed
her eyes completely.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Could it be that her
sharpened senses had sniffed out Nina's distraction? Did Karen really think
that such a bogus breathing technique had allowed her to reach a further
dimension of psychic ability?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">By the time she had
made it through one hour with her doubts, Nina was completely exhausted.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Partly because she had
been on her feet for so long, and partly because she had been overwhelmed by
something unfathomable that she sensed in the target in front of her.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Master. May I
test out my psychic ability for a moment?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen suggested, and
Nathan, the mentor, quietly walked out of the dojo. Perhaps he was trying to
avoid getting caught up in the situation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina wondered if she
should evacuate as well.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Kate, how
did you feel after trying the breathing techniques?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina didn't expect
Karen to talk to her, so she was a little surprised.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She wondered if she'd
let her guard down a little since they'd been facing each other silently for an
hour.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmm, I guess I
haven't quite got the hang of it yet......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This smells like
a sham, doesn't it?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen was smiling,
showing her white teeth.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She would never show
this kind of expression at the school.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Even the Heiberg
Academy, which gathers talent from all over the Empire, has not been able to
figure out the mechanism underlying the psychic ability. If you think about it,
there's no way that an ordinary old man like him could have discovered a
breathing technique that could enhance one's psychic ability."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"T-Then why are
you still coming here, Karen......?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From the way she
behaved at the academy, Karen seemed to have a personality that disliked
useless things.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even if she came to
the dojo on the recommendation of her parents or her maid Satya, she would have
abandoned it immediately if she found it to be suspicious.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, I thought
it would be good for &lt;conditioning&gt;."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Conditioning?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Have you ever
heard of the experiment where the dog that was fed after the bell rang started
salivating at the mere sound of the bell?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Ah, I think
I learned about it in class sometime ago."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's the same
thing. If you repeat this breathing technique over and over while
concentrating, you will be able to enter a deep state of concentration just by
practicing the breathing technique. In short, it's like you are creating a
switch for yourself that strengthens your psychic abilities."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So all this
breathing technique stuff isn't a complete sham then?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, that old
man probably didn't think that far ahead."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina was calmly
analyzing the matter.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">In other words, this is Karen's true nature.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To become a candidate
for the &lt;White Knights&gt;, she plays the role of an arrogant monster at the
school, but she shows a good deal of care for those who have no conflict with
her. The reason he was so guarded at first was probably because she wasn't sure
which stance to take.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She's tough, Nina
thought.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A liar who consciously
uses two different personalities is not a good opponent for a fraudster.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... I see
that is why you've been taking this so seriously, Karen."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"My abilities are
hard to control after all. But I've been able to stabilize them since I started
coming here."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As soon as she
finished speaking, Karen meditated and inhaled deeply.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Undeterred by the fact
that she was born with a powerful psychic ability, Karen has been training
voraciously. How much time has she spent trying to combine breathing techniques
with a deep state of concentration? Nina was honestly amazed.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Then Kate, get
behind me."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh?
O-Okay!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A speck of light was
generated at the tip of Karen's outstretched palm.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Upon closer
inspection, Nina could see a small crystal with a distorted shape.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The crystal, shining
brightly as it reflected the light, kept multiplying itself at a tremendous
rate, and in no time at all, it had swelled to the size of a human head.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That was the extent of
Nina's vision.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The rate of growth of
the crystals increased rapidly, flooding the area at once with a force like
that of a large amount of water being released from a dam. Crystals created
crystals, and new crystals created other crystals in a nightmarish chain of
events. The torrent of glittering light filled the entire dojo in the blink of
an eye.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">If someone were to be engulfed by something like this,
there would be no way they could survive.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A human body would be
easily crushed by such an enormous mass. Moreover, the torrent of light has
sharp edges growing out of various places, so even if one avoids becoming
trapped under it, one's body will be torn to shreds.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"N-No
way......."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina's mouth leaked out
her honest thoughts without an act.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The psychic ability of
[Jolly Underwriter], deploys crystals that continue to multiply themselves at
high speed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After seeing it
firsthand, she finally understood why it had been given such a dangerous name.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The multiplying
crystals are not only a powerful weapon that destroys everything, but also a
beautiful gravestone to bury the enemies that stood in Karen's way.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"All right, I'm
in great shape again today."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a satisfied
expression on her face, Karen wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The crystals, which
had been multiplying endlessly, stopped moving, and dry sounds echoed from
everywhere. In the next instant, the crystals that had filled the dojo began to
disintegrate and were converted into particles of light one after another.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In a world filled with
seven-colored light, the monster that had caused the supernatural phenomenon
was smiling.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"T-That's
amazing, Karen....... I'd be in big trouble if I got hit by one of those."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Rest assured.
And until I graduate, I'm not allowed to exert my full power on anyone but the
students at the Heiberg Academy...... Well, I can't prevent you from getting
involved if you're unlucky enough though."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Is that
also part of the &lt;conditioning&gt;?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah. If I put
that kind of restriction on myself, I can instantly increase my output to the
maximum when I fight at school. Now, just seeing those uniforms makes me want
to fight."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Whoa, I'm glad I
went to a different school......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While clad in the act
of a girl with a bitter smile on her face, Nina's brain was whirling with
frustration.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">This is bad. I can never win ...... against this
person.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What if this scam were
to fail?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What if she were to be
exposed as not a harmless younger sister-disciple, but an enemy competing for
supremacy at the Heiberg Academy?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">All that awaits Nina
would be a future of being crushed by a pretty gravestone.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, there is no
use in imagining all these bad things.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina decided to switch
her thoughts and return to her original task.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Umm. Could it be
that Karen is an outstanding honor student?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I was exempted
from the entrance exam. Well, it's nothing special though."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wait, wait, it's
the Heiberg Academy, you know!? For me, just taking the entrance exam would be
unthinkable......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Your psychic
abilities must be not suitable for combat, then, Kate?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah. It's just
a crappy ability to generate smoke when I rub my fingers together. I need to at
least increase the output a bit more ...... or it will be completely
useless."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin had taught her how
to do magic tricks by using chemicals to make smoke come out of her fingertips.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Heiberg Academy is
just an anomaly, but there are plenty of people with this kind of weak psychic
ability. Now that the culture of magic tricks has long since been lost, there
would be no suspicion.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina was prepared to
be looked at with pity, but Karen had a serious expression on her face.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... No, a
psychic ability is nothing more than a weakness."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a little more
digging, she might be able to draw out Karen's true feelings.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina tried to act the
part of a naive girl.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But if I had
powers like Karen's, I might even be able to become a member of the &lt;White
Knights&gt;."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Don't
tell me you're aiming for that too?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The atmosphere grew in
weight for just a moment.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin once said. When a
person reacts differently than usual in a conversation - if you trace that
reaction, you may be able to find out their secrets.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haha, that's
impossible. I mean, I have to get into the Heiberg Academy to be qualified,
right?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Indeed. Good,
then."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen squinted her
eyes and laughed, then went to call for the Master who had taken refuge outside
the dojo.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina pondered the
meaning of Karen's current smile. A moment ago, she also felt as if Karen had
hurriedly stifled the hostility that had leaked outside.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Was she
relieved that she didn't have to turn her fangs on the person with whom she had
just become acquainted with?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">This seemed to
indicate that her nature is on the good side, and at the same time, it also
reflected her strong will to mercilessly eliminate anyone who could be a
hindrance to her goals, even if only a little.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">What is it
that makes her go to such lengths?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Her childhood
dreams, her sense of elitism, her sense of duty, or her patriotism?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">It is also
possible that her loyalty to the headmaster is deeply rooted. There is no end
to my doubts, but it seems more likely that she is the &lt;shepherd's dog&gt;
than Casper.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">But what if Karen is innocent?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">This is the
same question that arose when I made contact with Casper some time ago. If
Karen is just a girl who is genuinely trying to become a member of the
&lt;White Knights&gt;, am I not trampling on her feelings?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Do I have the
resolve to commit such a sin?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;"> </span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Feeling the guilt
crawling up from under her feet, Nina desperately switched her thoughts.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Staring intently at
her target, who had returned to the dojo with the Master in tow, Nina decided
to formulate a plan in her brain to close the distance even further.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From the roof of the
building across the street, Jin observed the situation inside the dojo through
binoculars.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Thanks to Nathan, the
fake Master, who has kindly installed listening devices throughout the dojo, he
has no problem hearing Nina's and Karen's interactions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Since deciding to
commit fraud on both Karen and Casper, Nina has been rushing to learn practical
fraud techniques, and it seems that she has already mastered them well enough.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Rusty always said, [A
talented fraudster can become a first-rate stage actor], and it seems that the
opposite is true as well.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nevertheless, the
degree of difficulty of this operation is out of the ordinary.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the case of
ordinary fraud, the golden rule is to carefully investigate in advance and then
take advantage of the most gullible of the victims. In this operation, they
could not choose who they wanted to deceive, and they could be suspected from
the very beginning. If Rusty were here, he would definitely tell Jin to retreat
immediately.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Not to mention Karen,
who could not even be approached without disguising herself as Kate, Casper was
a formidable opponent, even though he appeared to be full of openings.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Last night, too, the
man made an unpredictable move.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When Jin came back
from the attic, he found a red-haired boy crouched in front of his room in the
dormitory.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The intruder who was
attempting to force open the locked door was Casper Crawford, who had been
making an all-too-obvious approach to Nina.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Do you
need something in my room?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oi, where the
hell have you been wandering around at this hour? It's past curfew."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Aren't you
breaking the curfew yourself?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You don't
understand anything, do you? I'm just doing it for love."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......
Seriously? This guy's really too aggressive."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm not talking
about you! Are you making fun of me just now!? I'll kill you!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin could not help but
be dumbfounded by his personality, which was so different from the one he had
when dealing with the female students.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Is this academy full
of nothing but liars?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Normally, I
wouldn't even want to see your face, my love rival......."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Wait,
love rival?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin didn't care about
what everyone thought about his relationship with Nina, but he couldn't afford
to have them get oddly jealous. Especially if the other party is a monster who
was exempted from the entrance exam, he wanted to avoid any unnecessary
conflict. Above all, we did not want to lose every chance to get in touch with
Casper.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I think I should
reassure him for now.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey, aren't you
misunderstanding something? Nina is just a friend."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ha? Are you
trying to make me drop my guard down?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Of course not
...... you don't believe me at all, huh?", Jin said so while making a
bitter expression on his face. "...... Alright. Can you promise me that
you won't tell anyone?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It's a fake reason
made up on the spur of the moment, but he can talk it over with Nina later.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nina and I were
childhood friends. We were in the same class for six years in elementary
school."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa? That's new
to me."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Because I
haven't told anyone about it. If this gets out, people will spread rumors that
I was able to get into this school because of my connections, and that will be
troublesome. That's why Nina doesn't tell anyone either."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What, so that
was what it was about......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As if his previous
hostility had been a lie, Casper laughed with cheerful smile.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I see, I see.
I'm so relieved. Well, it's obvious that there's no way I'm going to lose to
you, but nevertheless, it's good to have fewer rivals ...... Then, from now on,
please support my love journey, will you?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Alright,
alright, I'll support you, I'll support you."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Then, quick, tell
me about Nina-chan's hobbies. I'd like to have an excuse to ask her out on a
date."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Letting out a sigh,
Jin formulated a calculation in his mind.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In reality, she would
probably be in her room reading a book or going to the theater, but such a
gentle hobby does not fit her character as the &lt;Queen of Calamity&gt;.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Besides, he had a plan
for Casper that he had been thinking about for a while.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... I heard
that she's into collecting knives these days."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh, what an
exciting hobby ......!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I heard that there
is a store around here that specializes in knives with unique designs. If you
ask her out, she'll probably take you up on it."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I see. ......
Well, let me thank you in advance."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No
problem."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The extent to which
this will work against this selfish monster remains unclear, but it is an
ironclad rule of deception that one should always leave a favor to the other
party. It is the principle of &lt;repayment of favors&gt;, and a small favor
may someday turn into a big reward.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If he wanted to get
into Casper's pocket, this would be the most effective approach.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Then, let's do
our best."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin reluctantly
squeezed back the right hand that was held out in front of him.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From the outside, this
was a friendly gesture, but deep in Casper's eyes, he was not smiling at all.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This guy seems to have
a lot of openings, but at the heart of the matter, he draws a line between
himself and others. Perhaps this guy does not simply dislike men.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps this guy, in
essence, does not trust anyone.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">This kind of opponent is the most troublesome.</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin stared at the
guy's figure as it moved away from him, bitterly cursing inwardly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While Jin was skimming
through his memories of last night, Nina and Karen came out of the dojo.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From what he could
see, the two of them seemed to have grown closer than strangers. They were
chatting and laughing together.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A driver emerged from
the black car parked in front of the dojo a short while ago and respectfully
escorted Karen toward the car.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As far as Jin could
hear from the conversation through the listening device, Karen had to attend a
social party at her parents' house. Rich people sure are busy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[See you, Karen.
You'll come back next week, right?]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Who knows, it depends
on how I feel.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen got into her car
with a curt response, but information obtained from Detective Heath revealed
that she attended the dojo every week without fail.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Earlier, Karen had
told Nina that she used breathing techniques for &lt;conditioning&gt; to enter
a state of high concentration. Although it would be better if she could do it
in her room, perhaps she was trying to remind herself of the sights and smells
of the dojo each time she performed the breathing techniques. Master would
never have imagined it, it seems that his sham business is actually useful for
this monster.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As the car carrying
Karen drove away, Jin also made his way to the dojo.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After handing over the
hush money to Nathan, he and his accomplice, who assumed the appearance of a
nonexistent girl, walked out into the night. The two of them walked through an
unpopular residential area to the nearest bus stop, and their footsteps were
the only sounds that could be heard in the silence.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Walking side by side
like this, He could see that Nina's steps had become much heavier.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even after removing
her red wig and colored contact lenses, her nervousness still seems to be
present.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, how shall
I put it? Good work, Nina."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm so
exhausted, you know. I've never been Kate for such a long time
before......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I knew there was
a certain amount of risk involved."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Method acting.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A high-level technique
to blend oneself into a role and create a completely different persona. It is a
technique commonly used in the theater world, but Nina can perform it with near
self-brainwashing precision.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When she tricked
Bennett before, Nina was merely adjusting her values and her mental behavior
based on herself, but when she becomes a completely different person, it must
be very draining.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But, it did
allow you to get closer to Karen, didn't it?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Only as Kate,
though......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There are some
things you can talk about because you have nothing to do with the
academy."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But I wonder if
I can get her to tell me that she's working as a spy for the headmaster."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't worry,
I've prepared a trump card as well."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh, what is
it?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I can't reveal
it yet. For now, I want you to concentrate on your own task."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There it is,
Jin's secretiveness."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina pouted but did
not ask for more details about the trump card. This is proof that she trusts
Jin as an accomplice.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Before they knew it,
they had reached the main street. They were almost at the bus stop when Nina
seemed to notice something.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"T-That
billboard."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She pointed to a huge
outdoor billboard with a beautiful blonde-haired, blue-eyed woman on it. She
was holding a small pink bottle in her hand.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's the perfume
you gave me earlier. &lt;Glow Citrus&gt;, was it?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah. I decided
to buy you one when I saw the billboard."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Thank
you, Jin. I'll definitely repay you."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You don't need
to worry about it. I don't even know my own birthday."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"How is that
possible?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Look, I've been
living on the street for as long as I can remember, you know? Of course,
October 13th was written on my fake ID, but it's a day I don't have any special
feelings about."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... In that
case, let's make that day an important one from now on, shall we?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina went on using a
tone of voice that seemed to summon up all of her courage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'll make it a
big celebration for you. Jin, be prepared, okay?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Well, if
I can survive until that day."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin scratched his
cheeks, feeling a little itchy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He had a feeling that
whatever he said would all be wrong, so he had no choice but to surrender in
silence. After walking for a while, the bus stop came into view, and Jin
decided to forcefully change the subject.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Let me change
the subject, Nina. Can I trust you with another important task tomorrow?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Don't
tell me, is it Casper?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina made a blatantly
displeased face, but Jin continued regardless.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Tomorrow
morning, he's going to ask you out on a date."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A-A date!?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I gave him information
that you walk around the girls' dormitory on Sunday mornings, so I'm sure he'll
try to make contact with you under the pretense of a coincidence. When he
contacts you, tell him that you want to go to the restaurant on this piece of
paper."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Umm, are
you up for it, Jin?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, this is a
great opportunity after all."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah ......
figures."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The paper Jin handed
her contained the address of a dangerous establishment such as a knife
workshop.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After making sure Nina
had skimmed through it, Jin told her of his plan.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Remember the
terms when Karen offered you an alliance? She demanded that you investigate
Casper's psychic abilities. And besides, we, for our part, would at least like
to know the abilities of the person we're going to deceive as well. ...... So I
devised a plan to use on the day of the date."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There your
wicked face again......."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There's a small
burglary gang that's based in this area. The informant who is in touch with the
leader of the gang happens to be an acquaintance of mine - more specifically,
Mr. Heath. I asked him to pass on some information to the gang."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't tell me
you're planning to have those people attack the store? To force Casper to use
his abilities?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Of course, the
store itself is also fake. I had Gasta-san and his team renovate an old
abandoned store that had long been vacant, in hopes that someday I could use it
for something. Now they are putting knives on the shelves at a rapid pace. The
store is also currently staffed by Gasta-san's employees, so safety measures
are perfectly in place."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... That
doesn't make me feel safe!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin, who would even
use criminals as pawns for his goals, is clearly insane.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin is aware of that
much, but it is time for Nina to get used to it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If anything, she
shouldn't have any more energy left to argue with him.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... So, what
do you want me to do then?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh, you don't
have to do anything."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The corners of Jin's
mouth curved up in amusement.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Say something
like, "Let's see how you handle it", or something along the lines of,
"I'm not interested in weak people", and leave Casper to deal with
the robbery. I'm sure he'll want to show off his good side to you, and he'll
definitely use his psychic abilities."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I don't know,
wouldn't that make him think that I'm a very bad-natured girl?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"He's the type of
person who is infatuated with anyone who tries to push him around. So I want
Nina to play the part of a devilish woman through and through. And make him
totally in love with you."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-In
love......?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Hearing this, a deep
shadow appeared for a moment on Nina's face.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin did not miss this
change.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Huh, you
are not in it?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, that's not
it. For the sake of our plan, I don't have a choice, do I?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If you make him
fall in love with you, he might tell you some important information someday
...... huh, you seem to be a little bitter, after all."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm not bitter
at all."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A perfect, impeccable
smile.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even with that calm
expression on her face, Jin could see that Nina was hiding something.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... I'm not
demanding you to do any seductive techniques, you know?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You don't have
to worry about it, it's fine."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Then what are
you upset about......?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jin" Nina,
with a perfect smile on her face, closed the distance between them. "Let
me slap you just one time."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ehh!?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A palm accurately
struck him in the cheek, and a dry sound traversed across the night air.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......What the
heck?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina, who looked
satisfied, walked to the bus stop at a speed that made her look as if she were
fleeing, leaving Jin stunned with a burning sensation on his cheek.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">＊</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She was lost in
thought as she walked down the street at night toward her dormitory, where
there were no streetlights.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In her job, she has no
qualms about walking in the dark. Rather, she does not need the information
that sight provides in order to dive into the sea of thoughts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She is thinking about
the uncertainties that could threaten the school.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Combining all the
information she has obtained so far, there is no doubt that there are some
troublesome rats in the school. There are also several suspicious individuals.
All that is left is to find the evidence that will lead her to the rats.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Sensing the presence
of someone in the distance, she ducks into a nearby bush.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Looking closely, she
sees that two of the suspects happen to be walking together. They appeared to
be returning to the school after finishing some errands right now.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina Stingray and Jin
Kirihara.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In fact, their
movements were certainly strange.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although they had
defeated Bennetts Lohr right after they enrolled at the school, the number of
&lt;duels&gt; they have had since then has been extremely low. They even seem
to be avoiding fighting.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Considering that Nina,
who possesses powerful psychokinesis and is also known as the &lt;Queen of
Calamity&gt;, and Jin, who can nullify psychic abilities, aren't they a bit too
passive? Is it too much of a stretch to think that the two of them are working
behind the scenes for some other purpose?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">What to do? Should I just get rid of them now?</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She even constructed a
concrete image of a surprise attack, but she had not lost her composure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If she were going to
do it, she needs to wait until all the evidence has been gathered.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her purpose is to
protect the order and secrecy of the academy, not to eliminate everyone who
gets in her way.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After all, the
school's headmaster, Jill Will Weiser, is a very busy man.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He is also a member of
the &lt;White Knights&gt; and is said to be engaged in exterminating spies from
various countries who have infiltrated the empire. He cannot afford to be
bothered with a half-baked report.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even if there really
were other rats, she had confidence in her ability to find and kill them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">It's okay, I have plenty of time.</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If it becomes a
long-term battle, those who are hiding their secrets will eventually be
exposed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With sharp eyes like a
predator blending into the night, she keeps on following after them.</span></p>
