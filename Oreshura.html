<h2>Bonus: Witch's Wind Chime (Campanella)</h2>

<p>I had a dream.</p>

<p>Far, far away from here, in a quiet and peaceful dream of a distant twilight.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>During the twilight hours, walking on the way back home.</p>

<p>Surrounded by a sea of wheat.</p>

<p>The rice ears bear full fruits, swaying with the cool breeze. As the sunlight sinks into the western horizon, the surroundings emit a golden glow, reminiscent of a heavenly scene from a fairy tale.</p>

<p>Bell casually gazes at the surrounding scenery, then suddenly lifts his head, looking at the person beside him.</p>

<p>She is a dazzlingly beautiful woman.</p>

<p>Her hair is gray and very long.</p>

<p>Although she dislikes this color, finding it dirty, Bell likes it a lot.</p>

<p>Her eyes are always closed.</p>

<p>Living with closed eyes seems incredible to Bell, but according to her, &quot;even opening my eyes feels exhausting.&quot;</p>

<p>In this deep mountain area, she wears a conspicuous black dress.</p>

<p>She is a woman who becomes more and more beautiful the longer you look at her.</p>

<p>He is walking hand in hand with such a woman, strolling on the road.</p>

<p>While looking up at her side profile, Bell speaks.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, Auntie.&quot;</p>

<p>Thud!!</p>

<p>A very unpleasant sound echoes on Bell's head.</p>

<p>&quot;Be careful, or I'll hit you, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You already hit me!!&quot;</p>

<p>Bell holds his head, crying out loud.</p>

<p>The lightning-fast punch is not at the level of an instant anymore, leaving only the result of being beaten!</p>

<p>Whether it's defense or evasion, even awareness is impossible!</p>

<p>The difference between her and Bell's childish life is so distinct!</p>

<p>The impact pierces through the top of his head, spreading throughout his body! Pain! Agony!</p>

<p>This is the Gospel Punch, faster than even the shortest incantation!</p>

<p>In Bell's tear-filled vision, countless sparks fly out as he struggles in pain, as if a rabbit slipping on snow crashes into a rock.</p>

<p>At this moment, she sternly lowers her head and looks over.</p>

<p>&quot;Have I not taught you how to address me? Hm?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Mother Alfia, stepmother.&quot;</p>

<p>Very well, she says so.</p>

<p>She&mdash;Alfia, once again holds Bell's tiny hand.</p>

<p>&quot;And then? What did you want to say just now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...You won't hit me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You haven't said it yet; how would I know? But if you annoy me, I'll hit you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So scary!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I'll knock you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That will definitely hurt too!&quot;</p>

<p>Bell shouts based on past experiences.</p>

<p>After all, from the encounter with Alfia and the strong man Chald, these three years have never been a day without injuries for him.</p>

<p>Alfia ardently loves silence; she is a nervous &quot;queen.&quot;</p>

<p>Drawing her sword before opening her mouth is a matter of course.</p>

<p>If she says something is white, even if it's black, it will turn pure white.</p>

<p>Since three years ago, the rule at home has been not to provoke Alfia's anger. Before that, there was a time when Bell and his grandfather were making a ruckus together. She, sitting in a chair quietly reading a book, suddenly closed the book with a loud bang,</p>

<p>&quot;So noisy.&quot;</p>

<p>So saying, she rewarded him with a pile of bullets to the head like the end of the world.</p>

<p>Bell's vision turned dark, descending into silence.</p>

<p>When he woke up on her lap, he found his grandfather embedded in the wall, only his lower body exposed. Chald pretended not to notice, stirring a large pot and simmering soup for dinner. Chald, who was particular about eating, cooked exquisite meals, but due to not feeling alive, this seemingly last dinner on the quiet dining table had no taste. By the way, the grandfather was still stuck in the wall. Bell was struggling just to keep his hands from shaking.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be too noisy. Watch out for another bullet to your head.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yikes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I really hate noise. You just need to quietly report necessary things to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Mom! Sorry!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's this? Who taught you that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gran, my grandpa told me to say that...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That old fart. He's a cancer that only brings negative influence to Bell's education. Maybe I should use magic to send him flying over three mountains.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, please! Grandpa will die, please don't!&quot;</p>

<p>Among these people, Bell's grandfather and Alfia, who took care of him, got along the least.</p>

<p>When Alfia dragged the noisy Bell to take a bath, the grandfather would say, &quot;This old man wants to soak too&#9734;,&quot; then pounce over, only to be forcibly expelled from home a second later. To prevent his invasion, Alfia buried him in the middle of the field, leaving only his head exposed.</p>

<p>Moreover, when Alfia wanted to sleep with Bell, he would shout, &quot;This old man wants to sleep with Bell too!&quot; intending to crawl into the blanket, but</p>

<p>&quot;[Gospel]&quot;</p>

<p>Just one word ended everything. The walls and ceiling disappeared. Rather, the entire house vanished. All that remained was the floor and bed of Bell's room, with a beautiful starry sky visible when looking up. Bell, now an Alfia pillow, kept trembling in a supine position, unable to sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning, the tattered grandfather and Chald lay in the ocean of debris.</p>

<p>Since then, no one dared to resist Alfia.</p>

<p>By the way, the house has been rebuilt about ten times.</p>

<p>&quot;I won't hit you. Go on, tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>Alfia pulled Bell up and started walking again.</p>

<p>The sunlight made him squint, but with determination, he cautiously asked:</p>

<p>&quot;My real mother, what kind of person was she?&quot;</p>

<p>Bell completely understood nothing about his mother.</p>

<p>Since he could remember, there was only his grandfather around.</p>

<p>He had never felt sadness. However, he still felt lonely.</p>

<p>But now it didn't matter.</p>

<p>After all, Bell now has Alfia and the others.</p>

<p>So, this was just a simple question.</p>

<p>He had wanted to ask her, who understood his mother the most, for a long time.</p>

<p>Alfia didn't stop, continuing to walk for some time.</p>

<p>Then, she slowly opened her lips.</p>

<p>&quot;She was a very gentle person.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gentle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. Always had a smile on her face, and just being around could open up people's hearts. Physically weak but didn't seem illusory, talking about ordinary things but making people realize their mistakes. Incredibly, everyone loved her, a pure white woman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pure white...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, she harbored intense hatred for food.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Once, I secretly ate the dessert she was looking forward to. At that time, she was like she was going to breathe out dragon breath. It was the first time I prepared to face death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For the same reason, Hera... a certain goddess had to sit directly on a stone floor. The scene was worth seeing. After all, that unruly woman trembled humbly, tears in her eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>Bell's eyes turned into dots, unable to comprehend the words, but Alfia's voice was very steady.</p>

<p>She was more talkative than usual, and her mouth even seemed to be smiling.</p>

<p>It was genuine love.</p>

<p>&quot;Because everyone has to rely on others to survive, your mother never forgot how precious it is to 'live.' She wasn't self-deprecating, didn't forget to thank others, didn't succumb to hellish pain... Instead, she always had a smile, carefully experiencing the fact of living in the moment, more than anyone else.&quot;</p>

<p>So, your mother is gentler than anyone else.</p>

<p>Bell could grow without illness, thanks to his mother. That's what Alfia said.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, I didn't plan to come see you at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh!?&quot;</p>

<p>That was when words ceased, and a peaceful time arrived.</p>

<p>As the shadows of the two elongated in the sunset, Alfia, seemingly overwhelmed by nostalgic thoughts, revealed her inner feelings.</p>

<p>&quot;I always thought that I absolutely shouldn't appear in front of you.&quot;</p>

<p>After a while, Bell understood what this meant and was on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>This feeling of sorrow surpassed the loneliness of not having his mother around.</p>

<p>Living in a corner of the village with his grandfather, he eased his loneliness by reading stories of heroes from Heroic Tales.</p>

<p>Maybe, he once had such a future himself.</p>

<p>However, now that he knew her warmth, it was impossible.</p>

<p>She always closed her eyes, never showing a smile, but still used stiff movements to pat Bell.</p>

<p>Complaining on her lips, occasionally giving punishment, but she always held Bell's small hand.</p>

<p>The one who taught Bell what a 'mother' was, was the present woman, neurotic, willful, rough, and quite clumsy.</p>

<p>So, he really hoped she wouldn't say such sad things.</p>

<p>With tears in his eyes, Bell looked up at Alfia walking beside him.</p>

<p>&mdash;Then, why did you appear in front of me?</p>

<p>Almost dripping snot, he choked on these words, but Alfia still answered his question.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a strange fascination. I cared a lot about the child my sister left behind, so with Chald, I came to this deep mountain. Originally, I really planned to just take a look from afar and then leave.&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, her lips curved slightly.</p>

<p>It was a self-deprecating smile.</p>

<p>&quot;However, when I saw your 'white hair,' I couldn't help it. I couldn't suppress the emotions welling up in my heart. By the time I came to my senses, I was already standing in front of you.&quot;</p>

<p>Bell could now recall the day he first saw Alfia.</p>

<p>It was at dusk like today when Bell turned around and found her standing there absentmindedly.</p>

<p>First asked for her name, then her hands were placed on her round face, and then she quietly hugged him.</p>

<p>At that time, Alfia didn't shed tears or sob, but Bell felt like she was crying.</p>

<p>So, his short arms also wrapped around her back and hugged back.</p>

<p>Her body had a nostalgic scent.</p>

<p>He couldn't remember when, but Bell started crying.</p>

<p>This must be a 'diversion.'</p>

<p>If there were 'no strange fascination,' Alfia really wouldn't have appeared in front of Bell.</p>

<p>Their fates wouldn't intersect, unaware of each other, and the story would continue like that.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want to be separated from you or Uncle Chald, no matter what.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you wish for us to be with you forever, we're not gods. We can't fulfill your wish. After all, we are not eternal. I can't always be with you.&quot;</p>

<p>Bell, who had been listening to Alfia, struggled to say like he was on his deathbed, but Alfia still answered him calmly.</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you don't expect it, parting is destined to come. Don't forget that.&quot;</p>

<p>So, 'this time' is coming soon.</p>

<p>Bell thought so.</p>

<p>After all, Alfia's coughing had increased.</p>

<p>Bell knew that she often coughed violently in places where no one was around.</p>

<p>He also knew that fresh red blood mixed in.</p>

<p>Bell is seven years old this year.</p>

<p>It's been three years since he met Alfia and the others.</p>

<p>The time of parting is gradually approaching.</p>

<p>Bell, with thoughts that seemed to tear his chest apart, realized this.</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted. Everything in sight was dyed in the color of dusk. The sunset hanging over the ridge was very dazzling, and Bell, the crybaby, had moist eyes again.</p>

<p>He tightly held her hand, which she didn't want to squeeze back, walking on the not-so-distant way back home.</p>

<p>Alfia fell silent, and Bell, hating the quiet, desperately searched for words.</p>

<p>So, in the end, he asked another question.</p>

<p>&quot;The god who came yesterday... is it okay to send him back?&quot;</p>

<p>It was something that happened earlier.</p>

<p>A certain male god visited Bell and his family.</p>

<p>With dark black hair tinged with gray, he wore all black, resembling a resident of the darkness.</p>

<p>His face was exceptionally handsome, captivating even Bell, but the lack of a smile made his appearance somewhat terrifying.</p>

<p>The male god seemed to be looking for Alfia and Chald, talking about incomprehensible topics with them.</p>

<p>At that moment, even the usually noisy grandfather fell silent.</p>

<p>After listening, Alfia and Chald remained silent for a while, then said, &quot;Please leave.&quot;</p>

<p>Both of them apologized with a deep sadness.</p>

<p>The male god frowned, but for the first time, he smiled and said, &quot;What's there to apologize for?&quot;</p>

<p>He left with a somewhat regretful but relieved expression.</p>

<p>&quot;...Ah, that's fine.&quot;</p>

<p>Alfia, asked in this manner, nodded silently.</p>

<p>&quot;I have chosen you. I can't abandon you. I chose 'evil.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Evil'?&quot;</p>

<p>'Evil.' It frequently appeared in the tales of heroes. Bell was aware of such things.</p>

<p>However, he felt that the 'evil' she mentioned was somewhat different.</p>

<p>So, Bell asked again what it meant.</p>

<p>&quot;To destroy everything, smear chaos over order, question the existence of 'justice.' Also, to kill many people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kill?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Become a 'next-generation hero's stepping stone.' Take away important things from many people, attract hatred, evoke animosity, and then wait ahead after overcoming various difficulties, entrusting the future to them. All for the sake of saving this world.&quot;</p>

<p>At his young age, Bell didn't fully understand what Alfia was saying.</p>

<p>So, he started thinking from his own perspective.</p>

<p>Here, there is 'evil' that would take Alfia and others away from Bell.</p>

<p>Alfia and others would die.</p>

<p>He wouldn't see Alfia and others again.</p>

<p>Unforgivable.</p>

<p>Unforgivable, this kind of thing.</p>

<p>Even if it's for saving the world, Bell Cranel would never forgive this kind of 'evil.' No matter how noble or tragic the determination behind it, Bell, and those who were deprived, would never give their approval.</p>

<p>So, it would be better if Alfia and others didn't bear such responsibility.</p>

<p>They chose the path of not being hated or despised by anyone, which made Bell feel relieved.</p>

<p>However&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;But maybe because we didn't choose 'evil,' the world will be destroyed.&quot;</p>

<p>Regret filled her profile.</p>

<p>Although no one hated her, and she wouldn't be branded a criminal, she seemed to feel ashamed for not being tainted.</p>

<p>Alfia sighed.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps... the 'last hero' cannot be born.&quot;</p>

<p>Until now, Bell had never heard such a remorseful voice, never seen her so ethereal.</p>

<p>Why was Alfia so sad? Bell didn't know.</p>

<p>It was impossible to know.</p>

<p>But he didn't want her to be enveloped in sadness; that was a genuine feeling.</p>

<p>So.</p>

<p>So.</p>

<p>Bell uttered these words.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, I'll become a 'hero.'&quot;</p>

<p>Alfia's footsteps halted.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll become the last 'hero.'&quot;</p>

<p>Bell stopped moving forward, expressing his feelings to her sideways face.</p>

<p>&quot;So... Mom!&quot;</p>

<p>The impending separation with them brought sadness to him, tears filled his eyes, and his deep crimson pupils gazed at the only mother in the world.</p>

<p>Her arm lost strength, and delicate fingers slipped from Bell's hand.</p>

<p>The wind rustled the golden wheat, producing a quiet sound.</p>

<p>The twilight sky listened to this not as a baseless claim but as a 'promise' made by the youth to himself.</p>

<p>Perhaps one day, Bell Cranel would curse the choice he made on this day.</p>

<p>Maybe, upon realizing that the burden was too great, and there was no turning back, he would feel despair.</p>

<p>Even so, now he&mdash;</p>

<p>No, even if he became like that, too&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;...You're quite audacious, young one.&quot;</p>

<p>&mdash;wanted to engrave the smile that appeared on her face at this moment into his memory, to take pride in it.</p>

<p>Like a 'hero,' bringing smiles to those he cherishes.</p>

<p>Pointing out 'hope,' displaying 'future.'</p>

<p>Determined to advance toward the goal of 'ideal,' today marked the beginning of everything.</p>

<p>Without aspirations, without wishes, just etching the oath in his heart,</p>

<p>From this moment onward, the youth became a 'hero.'</p>

<p>&quot;Since you dare to speak grandiosely about being a hero in front of me, be prepared. At this point, there's no turning back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, starting tonight, Chald and I will train you fiercely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tonight!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whether we throw you into a monster's nest to endure humiliation or bind you to stones at the bottom of the river to experience the feeling of death... After all, I've never gone through this kind of training, so I'm not too sure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think this is training!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Silly child. How can you understand your limits without seeing the boundary between life and death? To become a hero, you need to surpass your limits about three hundred times.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What does 'limits' even mean?!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Alfia, who spoke incessantly, felt somewhat pleased.</p>

<p>Bell was already starting to regret it.</p>

<p>As he sweated profusely, face turning pale, he saw a pair of hands come in unexpectedly, combing through his white hair.</p>

<p>After a while,</p>

<p>&quot;So, let's stay together for a while longer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yes!&quot;</p>

<p>Her eyes opened, beautiful gaze fixed on Bell.</p>

<p>Bell covered her outstretched hand with his own.</p>

<p>Once again holding hands, they walked on the homeward path tinted with the colors of dusk.</p>

<p>On the slightly raised hill, he headed towards the grandfather and the man who were still waiting for them.</p>

<p>Bell wouldn't cry anymore.</p>

<p>He couldn't cry.</p>

<p>To show 'hope' to the former 'hero,' he smiled.</p>

<p>Advancing on the calm and peaceful path towards the 'future' colored by dusk.</p>

<p>&#9671;&#9670;&#9671;</p>

<p>Had a dream.</p>

<p>A dream where a woman he had never seen before, and Bell Cranel, who seemed to be himself but not, walked in the twilight glow.</p>

<p>This dream was very calm, very happy, extremely beautiful, yet incredibly lonely.</p>

<p>Now, at this moment, he noticed that tears were quietly streaming down the deep red eyes.</p>

<p>&mdash;To become a 'hero.'</p>

<p>The youth in the dream decided so.</p>

<p>He was determined to become a 'hero' who bore many burdens.</p>

<p>&mdash;Wanted to become a 'hero.'</p>

<p>His own still 'wish.'</p>

<p>He didn't know when this heroic wish, this train of thought, would turn into a resolution.</p>

<p>Or perhaps, would it become something different from this.</p>

<p>Unclear.</p>

<p>But he still had to move forward.</p>

<p>Don't lose to those blurry, almost forgotten images, and run.</p>

<p>He stood up, walked out of the room, and ran out of the guild.</p>

<p>Today, the youth also ran in the 'Heroic City' tinged with the colors of the dawn.</p>
