<h2>Epilogue: Distortion of the Prologue</h2>

<p><b>[Miu's POV]</b></p><p>Even I am surprised at myself.</p><p>I had never imagined that things would end up this way.</p><p>Maybe my heart was already prepared from that day.</p><p>Since that day when you helped me.</p><p>Even if you had minded your own business, even if you had turned a blind eye, no one would have blamed you.</p><p>Yet you caught her.</p><p>You saved what should have been broken and damaged.</p><p>Therefore, I wanted to understand you, talk to you and get closer to you.</p><p>I believed that the current relationship I had could go on forever, but someday it had to change.</p><p>I childishly believed that such things could happen, while pretending not to realize the contradiction between what I wanted and what we had.</p><p>We only realize that something is irreplaceable when it is truly lost.</p><p>(I did something wrong, didn't I?)</p><p>(Is it a sin to try to grab something that is out of my reach?)</p><p>(Is losing it forever a punishment worthy of my person?)</p><p>It has always been so.</p><p>When it comes to choosing one or the other.</p><p>I was never the chosen one.</p><p>If only I could change that fate.</p><p>I will offer it all.</p><p>As I listened to the distorted guitar sound coming out of the headphones, I slowly closed my eyes.</p><p>I followed the rabbit that appeared inside my closed eyelids.</p>
