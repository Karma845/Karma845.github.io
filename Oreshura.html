<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>If an ordinary high school student were to jump from the second floor, there's no way he wouldn't get injured.</p>

<p>Several days later, I found myself lying in a hospital bed.</p>

<p>In the hospital room, Kurusu-senpai, who had come to visit me, stared at me intently and said, &quot;You fractured your spine, of course you atleast need outpatient care but, you'll be discharged in two weeks... You're lucky one, aren't you? It could have been much worse, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, Senpai, are you... angry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm just astonished. Why did you have to jump to see Yui?!&quot;</p>

<p>Well, you could say it was a mistake driven by youth.</p>

<p>My jump from the second floor caused quite a commotion, and Kurusu-senpai is here to review the reflective essay I need to submit to the school. The reason for the jump was 'liberation from school is fire!' I knew that the jump was impossible for my body, but there's no way I can write, 'I wanted to see Mimori so bad' right?</p>

<p>&quot;I've marked the parts you should rewrite, so take a look later.&quot; As Kurusu-senpai returned the reflective essay to me.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, and thank you for your help... By the way, has my reputation at school gotten worse? I mean, I did passionately support Mimori.&quot;</p>

<p>There's also the possibility that they've found out that we're dating...</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry about it. The students aren't talking badly about you.... There are rumors circulating instead.&quot;</p>

<p>...Rumors? I tilted my head in confusion, and Kurusu-senpai continued, &quot;There's a rumor that there's a pure-hearted, virgin guy who got rejected by Mimori Yui but still can't move on about her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;People treat you as someone who got carried away because of your feelings for Yui, like when you stood up for her or the jump. It's like they see you as a guy who went overboard because you're infatuated with Yui. Nobody seems to imagine that you both are dating. It's a relief that your relationship hasn't been exposed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wha...!? But isn't that... not good at all?&quot;</p>

<p>Well, I should be relieved in a way, but it doesn't sound great. After all, it means that the entire school thinks I'm a weirdo... right?</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I don't think the rumors are that bad, so you don't need to worry, ....But speaking of Yui, she comes here to visit you quite often these days, doesn't she?&quot;</p>

<p>Kurusu-senpai loosened her lips and said, &quot;I think she'll probably come today too. She's been depressed this past days probably because she miss you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Wait depressed? You mean Mimori?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I do think she'll hide it to you though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Ruka, you came too?&quot;</p>

<p>A familiar voice from the door, and at the same time, Kurusu-senpai directed a smile at me that seemed to say, <i>'See, I told you she'll come.</i></p>

<p>Rumors, or rather... Mimori Yui, holding a bag from Mister Donut, was there.</p>

<p>&quot;She asked me to look at her reflective essay, so I'm here for that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... If you want, Ruka, would you like some donuts?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that sounds nice. Maybe I'll go get some coffee to go with them,&quot; she said, then quickly left the room.</p>

<p>It's a large room, but right now, there are no other patients except me. It's just me and Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;How's your condition? Any pain or discomfort?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if I said I'm fine, that would be a lie... Are you worried about me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're my boyfriend, after all.&quot; Mimori replied without any hesitation. Yep, that's a typical Mimori response.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, how's school been since then? I had a argument with Manaka, I'm sure people have been giving you weird looks...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you worried about that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, sort of. You're my girlfriend, after all....&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori chuckled and said, &quot;Actually, things have become more bearable. Afterward, Manaka apologized to me. She said she was sorry for misunderstanding and thinking I was trying to steal her ex-boyfriend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? Manaka actually apologized!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe she knew the truth all along but was just being stubborn. She still doesn't like me much, but at least she realized she was wrong about that, ...I apologized too, though. I said some bad things about her, even if it was to defend you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...That's amazing. Honestly, it's hard to believe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't I tell you? Manaka isn't a bad person... Maybe because you stood up for me, my impression of her has changed a bit.&quot; Mimori spoke it with a shy smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, everyone around us is pretty much the same, but Ruka, and Suzune-chan have started talking to me at school.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?... Kurusu-senpai, Suzune, too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They just say hello, but still. Riku, you talked to me in front of all those students. Both of them don't want to ignore me anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>I recalled the day I confessed in the courtyard.</p>

<p>...Well, that's just perfect. Maybe it's time I express something I've wanted to discuss since were here in hospital.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Mimori... Can I start talking to you from now on?&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori looked surprised, and I continued, &quot;We had such a straightforward conversation, so we can't go back to being strangers. We can talk when we feel like it, maybe grab a meal occasionally.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And maybe even go on a uniform date?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that's bit tough. I don't want it to be too obvious that we're dating. I'd prefer to keep it a secret as much as possible.&quot;</p>

<p>I felt a bit embarrassed and averted my gaze.</p>

<p>&quot;But at school... I want to have the kind of relationship with you that friends do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... I guess so. That means both you and I are now graduating from being loners.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I only made one friend, though.&quot;</p>

<p>Then I thought it had been quite a detour.</p>

<p>Desperately hiding my relationship with Mimori then pouring my feelings for her out to everyone in class... Finally, I could talk to her normally.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I understand. Let's keep our relationship a secret. But... when we're alone, we can do things that couples do, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori had a mischievous smile on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;For example, since we technically got back together after breaking up... how about doing the same things we did when we first started dating?&quot;</p>

<p>The words &quot;things we did when we first started dating&quot; brought a sweet tingling sensation to my lips. I could never forget. What happened on that day, in that dark clubroom.</p>

<p>My first kiss.</p>

<p>&quot;...You're joking, right? You can't be serious about doing this here...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But since you're still new to all this, you'd probably refuse if I asked normally, right? But, you see, right now, you can't escape. ...Opportunities like this don't come often, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>She closed the curtains around us and slowly leaned in towards me as I lay backwards on the bed.</p>

<p>Hey, wait a minute...!</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Riku-kun... Since this is pretty embarrassing, can you close your eyes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Hhhhh!&quot;</p>

<p>Without thinking, I closed my eyelids.</p>

<p>The distance between us was so close that I could feel Mimori's breath. My heart raced so loudly it was almost noisy, and then... a soft sensation on my lips.</p>

<p>It felt as if an electric current had surged through my entire body.</p>

<p>I couldn't open my eyes due to the embarrassment. My head felt light, and I couldn't be sure if this was real. But there was a sweetness in my mouth, almost like sugar...</p>

<p>...Sugar?</p>

<p>&quot;How was it? ...Did it make your heart race?&quot;</p>

<p>When I finally opened my eyes, Mizumori was there, holding a donut near my mouth, wearing a gentle smile.</p>

<p>Ah, I see now. That's what she meant.</p>

<p>Once again, Mimori tricked me.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, come on... You never change! Give back my composure!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, too bad, ....But I don't want to be the one who's always pushing you out. How about we do it the next time you want it?&quot;</p>

<p>She stood up and said, &quot;I'll go check out on where Ruka is. Bringing drinks for three people is quite a task. Hey, Riku-kun...&quot;</p>

<p>As Mimori placed her hand on the door of the room, she turned back and took a bite of the donut I'd kissed.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks for being my boyfriend... I'll be looking forward to seeing you at school.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah, I know. Thanks to you too.&quot;</p>

<p>Love is inefficient and unnecessary emotion.</p>

<p>That philosophy hasn't changed even now. Love is just a beautiful illusion, and I understand the pain that comes from loving someone, as well as the hurt it can cause.</p>

<p>However, even with all that...</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>It was at that moment. My phone, which was near the bed, started vibrating.</p>

<p>It was an incoming call. The caller...</p>

<p>&quot;Suzune? What's with the phone call?&quot;</p>

<p>Come to think of it, it had been a while since I talk to Suzune.</p>

<p>When I had just been hospitalized, she used to visit every day, saying, &quot;Because I'm your Kouhai!&quot; But lately, she hadn't shown up at all. I've been worried if something happened to her...</p>

<p>Even though this room is shared room, there was no one else here with me right now. Without hesitation, I answered the phone, and I heard a flustered Suzune on the other end.</p>

<p>&quot;W-oah...! U-Um, good evening, Senpai! A-And, ahaha, I'm sorry for getting flustered! I, I really didn't think you'd answer the phone...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yeah... It's been a while, but why are you so flustered? Did something happen?&quot;</p>

<p>After a brief hesitation, Suzune's small voice came through.</p>

<p>&quot;I have something I want to ask you, Senpai... It's about a rumor I heard at school, a rumor about you.&quot;</p>

<p>A rumor about me? I tilted my head in confusion, and then Suzune let out a small sigh... and revealed the secret that no one should have known: &quot;Senpai... are you dating Mimori-san?&quot;</p>
