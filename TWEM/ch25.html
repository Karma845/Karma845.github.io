<h1>Chapter 25: The Way of the Battle</h1>

<div class="text-left">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa, it’s no use no matter how fast you run.”</span><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Several knives were thrown toward me again but I changed their trajectories by deploying blue electricity around them so that they wouldn’t hit my head. A few knives still scratched my skin, cut through my robe while I adjusted my position so they would not hit Her Highness.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at Arsenas, who approached me. The sound of his shoes echoing in the air. I pulled out the knife stuck in my side at once and cast a healing spell on the affected area, ignoring the other cuts.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s only a first aid measure to narrow the wound, but it’s better than nothing.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, are you all right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, it’s off the mark. What’s more pressing now is…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I fired an arrow of light from my fingertips aiming at Arsenas, but just before hitting the target, it clashed with the tip of his sword, deflected to the windowpane of the house behind him, and bounced back. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Did he just execute high-speed light magic at such a close range? In addition, the throwing technique of the knife is extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… I thought he could only use swords.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“The knights are the ones who fight with all their best no matter what the situation and place are. Isn’t it natural for them to be able to master all armours and instruments?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I haven’t heard that they use knives …</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">He’s a knight, so I wanted him to fight using the royal sword… No, it’s wonderful if he is protecting someone, but now that I’m standing as his enemy, it’s really troublesome.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, what shall we do? Your favorite long-distance magic is easy to read and difficult to handle if you use it at close range. In addition, you’re injured. Are you ready to hand over the princess?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… Maybe, I might.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">As Arsenas said, the situation is terrible. It’s disadvantageous to fight while protecting Her Highness in an injured state. As he said earlier, all I have to do is hand over Her Highness. The mission will fail, but my life will be saved. In terms of profit and loss, it would be better to do as he says.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… But,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at Her Highness behind me, who glanced at me anxiously. I smiled and turned back to face him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not such a bad person to abandon a weak girl. And do you think you’ve already won? Don’t you know that you should not be careless until the very end of a fight, Deputy Commander of the Royal Guards?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… That’s too bad.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">With a sigh, Arsenas takes a step forward.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I’ll risk my life and take the princess away.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled out the rapier and invoked it with magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I have to do my best. We don’t have that much time. I’m going to use all the magic I know to finish it as soon as possible!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… Ice Crystals!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Palm-sized ice crystals were produced and flew toward Arsenas, rotated while freezing the moisture in the surrounding air and pushed forward.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Water Attribute Long Distance Advanced Magic – Ice Crystal.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">This magic itself has no killing power.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The purpose is to restrain him. As soon as it landed on him, the ice would spread in waves, making him unable to move.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether it’s prior information or intuition, Arsenas steps aside without attacking it with his sword. The ice landed behind him, on the wall of a house quite far away and a large area on the wall froze immediately.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey! I wanted you to cut it with your sword!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”I had a bad feeling about it… Light-Blade!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A light shines on Arsenas’ sword as he wields it with all his might. A slash of light approaches me at a tremendous speed to cut me in half. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I also crawl the rapier’s blade with light and shake it to counteract the slash. At the same time, the ice path is activated over a wide area starting at the foot of the wall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I use flame attributes short-range beginner magic – Geothermal Heat. Ice gets heated in an instant and produces steam, filling the air with white fog. All at once, our vision gets hindered.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">At this moment, I lifted Her highness and started running on the roof again.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">If we arrive at that place, we can win! We can’t miss this opportunity!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, a little more patience. It’s only a little way to the Knights’ residence. I’ll make sure to send you home.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes… oh, Raize-sama, blood…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness touched my pale arm. Apparently, the bleeding from the cut wounds is getting worse now that we are running. But the question is… what are you doing, Your Highness?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, what?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know a little healing magic. I’ll try to heal this wound.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness touched one of my wounds, and a warm light lit up, and the painful wound gradually closed. It’s like healing magic but a few grades higher than the healing magic I can use. The pain has subsided and I feel much better.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you very much. Your Highness, I can’t believe you can use such magic.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did it help you a little?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”Yes, very…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“… oh, isn’t this so sweet!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I sensed the knife thrown from behind and avoided it without stopping. But…</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”Oh… oh!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The knife, which I was supposed to have avoided, changed its direction in the middle of its flight and flew at me again. I couldn’t avoid it in time and it got stuck deep in my thigh.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… Oh, the magic of automatic tracking!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Arsenas, who jumped onto the roof of the building, expressed his affirmation of my words.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I used it on you on the roof of the palace annex before… don’t you remember?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… It was you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think that anyone can fly a knife to that distance? That man might certainly have good throwing skills, but I’m more capable.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed certainly unnatural when I recalled it. The distance to that place is never normal.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if he was a scapegoat… A shadow warrior so that Arsenas wouldn’t be exposed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now your leg is injured? It’s about 800 mailers from the last station to the residence you’re aiming for. How long do you think it will take with that leg? It’s much easier to beat you before you arrive… It seems like it’s time for the speeches from the royal family to begin.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Arsenas took out his watch from his chest and checked the time. Then, I heard fireworks set off in the distance which then exploded above.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s over.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">He said and came closer.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">My whole body is covered with blood. Arsenas, on the other hand, is still unwounded. It’s obvious which is more advantageous.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”But I won’t stop — Light Sword!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">He lifted his sword in his hands above his head and shook it down at once. A torrent of light appears from his sword in the shape of an arc that approaches me while scraping the roof tiles… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My vision was filled with light for a moment.</span></p>
