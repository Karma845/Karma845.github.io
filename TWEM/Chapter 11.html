<p>It was an old memory of the beautiful mansion. The garden was full of bright flowers. A girl was swinging her sword there. She had silver hair and was desperately swinging her sword.</p>
<p>“That’s not how you do it. Lend me your sword for a bit.”　</p>
<p>“Uhn.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>A man with similar silver hair called out to her. Their faces look similar, but the man looked more dignified and had a slightly different features than the girl.　</p>
<p><em>“Namikaze </em>is, how to say this… it’s more like, well, there is a stance for it, but it also has the flexibility to not stick to said stance.”　</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“Aah, so you find it hard to understand. Here, I’ll perform it with you.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>With that said, the man returned the sword back to the girl. Then he held the girl’s hand and moved it along to let the girl’s body learn the movement.　</p>
<p>“I want to be like tou-sama!”　</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Even without a magic attribute, I will grow into a paladin that will surpass tou-sama!”</p>
<p>“…I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
<p>“Un, that’s a promise!”</p>
<p>“I am sure Yururu can become a greater knight than I am. That’s why&#8212;“</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Tou-san! I’ve become a paladin!”　</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Gaheris.”</p>
<p>“I’ll enter tou-san’s unit and… Yururu?”</p>
<p>“I also wanted to quickly become one!”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You have to wait until you’re fifteen, okay? Even so, Agra nii-san is already ninth-rank, huh.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He has talent after all.”</p>
<p>“On the other hand, Yururu has no magical aptitude.”</p>
<p>“I will still become an amazing paladin even without it!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She remembered everything. Her kind brothers, the wide back of her father, her strict mother.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>But she could no longer return to those days.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">　■◆</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>A night passed. Yururu only hurt herself yesterday. She fell asleep because of the heavy bleeding and exhaustion of training. However, there was no lethargic feeling due to lack of blood when she woke up in the morning, even though the blood she spilled yesterday would have likely killed a normal person.　</p>
<p>However, she didn’t question it. Her impulse just urged her to take action.　</p>
<p>She naturally took her sword and went outside.　</p>
<p>Her vision was distorted. Her impulse didn’t stop. She wanted to kill those ruffians who always insulted her parents.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>A, aah, no, good… if, I, do, this, nobody, will, believe, in, tou, sama, and, kaa, sama, any, more…</em></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>People went about in the morning.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>I want, to kill… that, person, and, that, person, is, laughing, at, me.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She could only see everyone around as enemies. Her body ached beyond her control. She wanted to hurry and use her sword to cut some heads and produce the red liquid, just like the blood she spilled yesterday.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>There was malice, grudge, and resentment. Such feelings filled her. However, there was something left of her. It was the memories of her kind parents. That allowed her to somehow restrain herself.　</p>
<p>However, even those memories were gradually being painted black. They were reduced to mere memories. Her core began to shake.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Once the grudge filled her, she would collapse. If a person she resented appeared, she would instantly turn into a slaughterer. Even if that didn’t happen, her impulse was getting stronger the longer it took.　</p>
<p>She bit her own tongue. She could taste her own blood. She somehow kept her reason and went to the usually empty place where only three trees grew instead of the headquarters of the Knights of the Round Table. Fortunately, there was no sword training today.　</p>
<p>That was why she thought they wouldn’t be there as she walked there.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Aah… I, didn’t, come, to, Fay’s, morning, practice, today…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She suddenly remembered that as she leaned on the tree. As her memory gradually became blank, she remembered the back of that black-haired boy. When she thought about how she managed to teach him <em>Namikaze </em>which made him grow stronger, she was filled with happiness.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Noo… I, really, wanted, to, teach, you, more…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>From now on, she couldn’t turn back anymore. She knew she would step away from the human path just like her elder brothers did. Her tears spilled. If that reckless boy she taught heard how she met her end, then… she was sad at the thought.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Even, though, I, was, going, to, prevent, him, from, becoming, like, nii, sama… To, think, that I, would,lose, my, way.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>How much time had passed? She just thought of her regret. But eventually, she got swallowed by hatred. She got devoured and <strong>practically </strong>vanished.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>…That’s right. I’m, not wrong. I’m, not wrong at all. I’m not wrong, I’m not wrong, I’m not wrong, I’m not wrong, I’m not wrong, I’m not wrong.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Those people who made a fool of me are in the wrong. I am not wrong at all.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“A, hahahaha! I’m not wrong, I’m not wrong!”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>As she said that, she stood up and turned her feet. But there was…　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Huh! Isn’t it sensei!”　</p>
<p>“Sensei, good afternoon.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Bouran, Tlue, and Arthur stood there. Yururu no longer questioned why they were here. The three usually visited this place after they were done with their magic practice, but Yururu couldn’t have known that.　</p>
<p>By the way, even as Fay was told sarcasm by the magic instructor, he still requested a magic instruction manual. Although he had no aptitude, he didn’t give up on his own potential.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>They are all more talented than me, with several magic elements… They are looking down on me. Even they make fun of me. I’ll kill them, I’ll kill them, let’s kill them.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Who are you?”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Arthur asked that. She looked at Yururu with suspicion. Arthur intuitively felt that the person in front of them wasn’t the Yururu Garethia they were familiar with.　</p>
<p>“Ah? What are you talking about?”　</p>
<p>“Arthur-san?”</p>
<p>“This person is not our sensei…”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>With that said, Arthur enchanted the iron sword she borrowed for practice purposes and drew it.　</p>
<p>Without answering anything, Yururu also drew her iron sword.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>At the next moment, the pair collided as they became wind, and the gusts it caused blew Bouran’s long hair.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“…Aah, how good it is, to have such talent.”　</p>
<p>“…I’ll ask you one more time. Who are you?”</p>
<p>“Does it matter who I am? All I want to do right now is kill!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Arthur felt that she couldn’t talk to her. Yururu had already totally lost herself.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Physical reinforcement through the use of<em> art</em>, both of them were using simple non-elemental skills. Both of them were using them at similar levels, no, Arthur’s was more precise.&nbsp; 　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Arthur’s sword gradually increased its speed. She possessed a greater amount of <em>art </em>and was more precise in controlling them. It was important to not overdo physical strengthening since one’s body would break down otherwise. That was why Arthur came out superior.　</p>
<p>It wasn’t like Arthur mastered everything either.　</p>
<p>Yururu had long years of training and experience. She had the advantage in that aspect.　</p>
<p>“…Are you cutting corners?”　</p>
<p>“…Hah?”</p>
<p>Arthur muttered. She understood that Yururu slightly loosened her hand and was restraining her ability.　</p>
<p>Arthur was better by the amount of <em>art </em>she had. However, Yururu’s swordsmanship was supposed to be far better than Arthur’s.　</p>
<p>Arthur knew that well. She understood that from the light exchange they did during the training.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“…Are you making fun of me?”　</p>
<p>“…That’s not it.”</p>
<p>The exchange was getting stronger. However, Arthur was still dominant at the moment.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Oi, Arthur, what should we do?!”　</p>
<p>“For the time being, Bouran is to call other paladins for support.”</p>
<p>“O, ou! Okay.”</p>
<p>“Tlue is to stay here and support me. Your magic please.”</p>
<p>“O, okay.”</p>
<p>Bouran left and Tlue proceeded with his chant. Multiple water bullets were conjured. It was adjusted properly so it wouldn’t kill even if it hit others. It might deal considerable damage, though.　</p>
<p>“Cih…”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Yururu clicked her tongue. The combination of the pair gradually shaved her <em>art </em>and stamina. However, it was clear that there was slight relief in her tone.　</p>
<p>As for Arthur’s light magic… 　</p>
<p>It produced a golden wind that blew her away. The dark <em>art </em>was gradually shaved off little by little.　</p>
<p>She was gradually returning to her sanity. However, that wasn’t enough to stop her. The primitive anger still moved her.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>That still lingered on her mind and couldn’t be forgotten and finally, Arthur would hit her with&nbsp; light magic and finish the fight.　</p>
<p>~~　</p>
<p>After that, it would just be a story of a paladin leaving the capital.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She would be expelled from the knights&#8217; brigade and would have to leave the royal capital Britannia. She would lose the place to belong and everyone would look at her with disappointment. Since she was originally a good person, the slight expectation of others would turn to disappointment.　</p>
<p>The three would also explain that her state was weird, but people around would only be reminded of those abominable incidents instead.　</p>
<p>They would all say that she was just crazy too.　</p>
<p>Either way, it was just a waste of time. It was because Yururu Garethia had already given up on staying to clear her parents’ name. 　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She would chose to leave this place on her own.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>That was the ending she chose. She couldn’t be saved. Then after she leaves, she would find her brother… only to be raped and killed.　</p>
<p>~~</p>
<p>As Arthur’s magic… was coming down at her. Yururu felt the light gather on Arthur’s hand, and she burst into tears.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It was over. Everything has ended…　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Wait.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>A voice echoed. Arthur stopped constructing her magic and the light dispersed from her hand as if it was never there.　</p>
<p>“Fay… why?”　</p>
<p>“I heard a lot from Bouran. Arthur, give me your sword.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Don’t let me say it again. Hand it over. This is my fight (story).”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Fay forcefully took Arthur’s sword away. In front of him, Yururu, who was battered all over by Arthur and Tlue, already lost most of her stamina. However… Yururu said without even thinking about who would win if she were to fight Fay.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“…”　</p><div class="watas-aca6e7b21e754797b082a3f68e02cd42 watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-aca6e7b21e754797b082a3f68e02cd42"></div>
<p>“…So it’s Fay-kun who will fight me this time?”</p>
<p>“Aah, Arthur, Tlue, don’t interrupt us.”</p>
<p>“…Fufu, you sure say a strange thing. You can’t beat me, you know? Also, haven’t you lost whenever we fought using iron swords?”</p>
<p>“And what of it?”</p>
<p>“You’ll die if you actually fight, you know? Are you so foolish as to not know that?”</p>
<p>“Fuh. I am…”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>As Yururu giggled, Fay replied with a snort.　</p>
<p>“I am certainly a fool, but it’s exactly because I am a fool, that I won’t know unless I actually do it.”　</p>
<p>“…Very well. It’s too late to regret it when you die, you know?”</p>
<p>“Come.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Both of them kicked the ground and the swords clashed. It was different from when they were using wooden swords. The heavy sounds of metal reverberated.　</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>Both of them unleashed beautiful swordsmanship. It wasn&#8217;t an exaggeration to say their swords were exactly the same.　</p>
<p>Yururu’s sword, which flowed like a clear stream, was accepted without expression. Fay couldn’t use any <em>art</em>. His lack of experience made him unable to operate his <em>art</em>. That was why his sword lacked speed unlike the clash between Arthur and Yururu earlier.　</p>
<p>However, Yururu also had her <em>art </em>shaved off during her fight against Arthur and Tlue earlier. She barely had any left.　</p>
<p>And she unconsciously abandoned the choice of using what she had left. Perhaps it was due to what little goodwill remained in her, or because <strong>she wished to stand on equal ground to the proud knight in front of her.　</strong></p>
<p>Nobody knew the answer.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Metallic sounds echoed many times.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The beautiful slash, reminiscent of a crescent moon, made a slight cut on Fay’s right shoulder. However, Fay paid no mind to the wound and tried to trace that crescent sword slash.</p>
<p>Unlike what happened to Fay, Yururu easily parried it.　</p>
<p>The pair struggled evenly… at least initially. However, the difference between them gradually began to widen.　</p>
<p>“I think it’s better for you to stop, you know?”　</p>
<p>“Not yet.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>These were the words coming from a knight who was overwhelmingly better than him, but Fay denied them which sounded like fate. However, as if the truth agreed with the prophecy, Fay’s left shoulder got stabbed.　</p>
<p>It wasn’t like the stab made a loud noise in particular. However, it felt like such a sound rang loudly to others. Blood spilled from his shoulder, which made Fay click his tongue while taking a distance.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Fay, stop it already. You’ll die. We can just fight together&#8212;“　</p>
<p>“Shut up. Don’t interrupt the battle.”</p>
<p>“Fay… I&#8211;”</p>
<p>“Did you not hear what I said? I told you not to interrupt.”</p>
<p>“But if it stays this way, that’s… doesn’t that shoulder hurt?”</p>
<p>“It’s obvious to get wounded. I wouldn’t stay in my path if I can’t endure this much.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>It’s obvious to get wounded? It pierced quite deeply. His blood is spilling.</em>　</p>
<p>As expected, Tlue couldn’t tolerate having a person die in front of him. Since they could win if they just fought together,　</p>
<p><em>Fay… you are already,</em>　</p>
<p>Arthur was also worried about Fay. As both of them were trying to stop Fay,　</p>
<p>“What’s with those eyes<strong>? Piss off.”　</strong></p>
<p>They felt a chilling sensation that froze their spine as if they were actually thrown into a glacier. Fay’s gaze was sharpened beyond what was normally possible and he exuded great intimidation.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>His gaze silenced the two.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Fufu, Fay-kun sure is foolish.”　</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“After all, your defeat is already confirmed. What are you going to do about it?”</p>
<p>“…Fuh, this is just a farce.”</p>
<p>“…Yes?”</p>
<p>“Why didn&#8217;t you crush my head with that slash? You could just aim for my head instead of my shoulder.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I don’t like it. Just put your all and try to kill me. I will accept everything. And then I will surpass you.”</p>
<p>“gh… What’s with you? What do you think you know about me?!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She was enraged and attacked him. However, Fay still resisted even at his disadvantage. Blood overflowed from his shoulder as he exerted his strength.　</p>
<p>“See, isn’t it painful? How about stopping already?”　</p>
<p>“I won’t stop. Also, it doesn’t hurt that much.”</p>
<p>“…Aah, I see. Then I’ll go for it! I can kill a fool like you without mercy!”</p>
<p>“That’s fine.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Yururu swung her sword and slashed. The state of their battle didn’t change and Fay was still forced to defend. 　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking about this for a long time, but you have no talent, you know? You have no magic aptitude. And even if you do have your sword, there are tons of people who could do the same. Many people out there are better than you.”　</p>
<p>“I guess so.”</p>
<p>“There are more paladins who focus on magic out there, of course there are. After all, they could achieve more in a single shot of magic than a single swing of a sword. Even if you continue to swing your sword, nobody will approve of you, and you’ll stay in the bottom as you get older.”</p>
<p>“Fuh, maybe I will.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Who was she talking about? Was it Fay? Or was it herself? She could no longer tell.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Are you alright with that? Your shining future as a paladin would be&#8212;“　</p>
<p>“Kukukuku.”</p>
<p>“What’s so funny about it…?”</p>
<p>“No, well… I just thought that you’ve only mentioned the obvious things all this time.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Both of them opened their distance for once. Yururu sharpened her eyes and glared at Fay.　</p>
<p>“There is nobody who shines everywhere. However, there is also nobody who does not shine somewhere. That’s all there’s to it. I won’t change regardless of what you say. I will still beat you down right here.”　</p>
<p>“Do you really hate me that much?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I can’t stand seeing it. I felt your sword was necessary for my own strength. However, your current self does not even have such worth.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Then Fay’s tone turned rougher. It wasn&#8217;t a voice of anger. It was more the tone of talking in delirium. That voice possessed a certain weight.　</p>
<p>“Don’t screw with me. I’m definitely not going to forgive seeing the sword that I approve of turn this way. That’s why I will teach you. About the sword I acknowledge, that is.”　</p>
<p>“&#8212;gh.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>He held the sword with his right hand and pointed the tip of the sword at her as he said that. Then he held it with both hands again.　</p>
<p>“It seems I talked too much. Let’s put an end to this.”　</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p><em>…I, I am… no, that’s not it. He also looks down on me and laugh… laugh…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Yururu was trying to find the excuse to deny him. However, she only saw how serious he was within her mind. Even though they were practically together all day every day, not even once did she ever see him laughing. He was always giving it his all.　</p>
<p>That was why she couldn’t continue the words in her mind.　</p>
<p>Perhaps she was already defeated at this point.　</p>
<p>“Kuh, I’m still…”　</p>
<p>They ran toward each other. She looked at his shoulder, which bled even now. She could feel that any further bleeding would be dangerous to his life.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>He shouldn’t be able to feel his shoulder anymore… even his movement has become looser.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>His movement was slowing down. She could feel that. However, the same also applied to her.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Both of my hands… and legs… are already…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Their conditions were the same. However, Fay’s spirit and gaze pressured her.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“This will end it!”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>But she was slightly faster. She executed a sword slash from Fay’s lower left to flash upward. She was convinced of her victory.　</p>
<p><em>Goodbye, Fay (me).</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>That was what she thought. That was just her assumption. Just before her sword touched him, he lowered his posture. Because of that, the sword struck empty air as if attracted to the sky.　</p>
<p>It was a movement both Fay and she were familiar with since he had always practiced it all this time. The continuous pressure made her vision narrow, and it was the checkmate move, grasped by him who never gave up on his victory until the end.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Damn it…!</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>However, she immediately corrected her sword trajectory and swung her sword down from diagonally above. Fay received the attack with his blade horizontally which he turned vertical at the next moment.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Her sword was swept down like a waterfall. And Fay used the momentum to counter.　</p>
<p>Namikaze Seishinryuu, First movement<em>, Namikaze.　</em></p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Aah… that is my…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Her memory revived. Fay used the counter sword technique and pointed his blade at her. That figure overlapped to her own, back to the days when she still knew nothing and still had everything.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>I see… so I only wished to return… Not to the present where I am bound by talent and responsibility.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>But back to the days when I still swung my sword happily, with my father, mother, and elder brothers accompanying me…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Fay swung his sword. However, his blade stopped just before it reached her neck. 　</p>
<p>“It’s my victory. Any complaints?”　</p>
<p>“I have none… it’s my total defeat…</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She was just laughing. Even though she was well aware she couldn’t stay here in the future. But despite that, the smile she showed was a beautiful one.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">　■◆</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Huh? Sensei didn’t come to the morning practice today?　</p>
<p>Did something happen? Maybe she got a stomachache?　</p>
<p>The magic instructor for today’s training was a very ill-tempered old man, but I wouldn’t be discouraged. The old man lent me the book. It’s all the preparation for the time of my awakening!　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Spending my day like that,　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Ah! Fay!”　</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“It’s terrible. Actually, it’s blah-blah yadda-yadda!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Wha, what did you say?! Sensei went berserk?! This was totally an event for me! On top of that, I learned <em>Namikaze </em>just yesterday!!　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Okay, got it.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>I turned into a winner. This was definitely an event where the disciple saves his master from falling to the darkness! Time to go! To the event!　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Wow, this would totally be a hot turn of events! To land a finishing blow with the very move that my master taught me to my fallen master. Then I managed to save her that way, it made my heart <strong>hot </strong>and the <strong>thick </strong>tofu was cooked (mystery). <span id="easy-footnote-1-20254" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-20254" title="T/N: Basically, a horribly bad pun due to hot and thick both spelled as atsu. Also, the mystery was in there due to no relation between two sentences. ED: our mc is clearly very smart"><sup>1</sup></a></span>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>When I dashed there, Arthur was about to land the finishing blow. That was dangerous, you know? This was my event, okay?　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>No, really, I couldn’t let my guard down. Arthur and Tlue were trying to steal my spotlight.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Wasn’t it often for such people to exist in fiction? The people who got the first rank in the popularity poll due to that. They acted more protagonist-like than the actual protagonist so it ended up that way. I didn’t really like that kind of development. <span id="easy-footnote-2-20254" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-20254" title="T/N: That’s totally you, although you’re in the dark about it."><sup>2</sup></a></span>　</p>
<p>My principle was to have the protagonist take the best part.　</p>
<p>As expected, it was time for me to play an active part!!　</p>
<p>Sensei was strong as expected. She was still this strong even though she fell to the darkness, also Arthur and Tlue already shaved her strength to some extent, right?　</p>
<p>Wow, she really was strong. It was my first time using an iron sword, though… Well, it would be normal for the protagonist to have such resolve (Diamond mentality).　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Fay, stop it already. You’ll die. We can just fight together&#8212;“　</p>
<p>“Shut up. Don’t interrupt the battle.”</p>
<p>“Fay… I.”</p>
<p>“Did you not hear what I said? I told you not to interrupt.”</p>
<p>“But if it stays this way, that’s… doesn’t that shoulder hurt?”</p>
<p>“It’s obvious to get wounded. I wouldn’t stay in my path if I couldn’t endure this much.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Being wounded was basic for a hard working protagonist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>That was why, well, I didn’t mind it since it wasn’t a big deal. It wasn’t like I was gravely wounded anyway, right? 　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Enduring wounds was also a basic for the protagonist, you know?　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“What’s with those eyes<strong>? Piss off.”　</strong>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>My spotlight was not to be stolen. This was the event for the disciple.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Ah-, Sensei. Your sword was somehow weird. I said this as your disciple, but it lacked the usual sharpness (mysterious arrogance).　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Well, after one thing and another… I was wondering how to pull off <em>Namikaze </em>to end the battle with style and proceeded to do it.　</p>
<p>　</p><div class="watas-4a0a14244d63bc8eeab917ac1d1b57f1 watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-4a0a14244d63bc8eeab917ac1d1b57f1"></div>
<p>　</p>
<p>Even though it was the battle against sensei, I somehow felt the sense of mission to end the battle using it.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Not only would it be cool to decide the battle using <em>Namikaze, </em>but<em> </em>it would also likely save sensei from falling into the darkness. Wouldn’t it look cool to decide the match using the very skill she taught her disciple?　</p>
<p>To suggest combining our power and barraging her with magic for this situation was a real turn off for me. Since I couldn’t use magic, I couldn’t be active in that.　</p>
<p>Haa, haa, it was time for <em>Namikaze</em>, haahaa, I was really itching to use it!　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>By the end, I did train like performing a crescent slash. I just traced it in my mind and somehow managed to pull it off. So this was the protagonist&#8217;s correction…　</p>
<p>“It’s my victory. Any complaints?”　</p>
<p>“I have none… it’s my total defeat…</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Sensei was smiling. Thank you, sensei. I truly felt like a protagonist today.　</p>
