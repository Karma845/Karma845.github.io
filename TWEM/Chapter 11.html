<h3>Chapter 11: Alchemy Study Group and the Doubt of Homunculus</h3>

<p class="calibre1">The suspicious evening party hosted by the alchemist Herme s continues. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  alchemy  study  session,  a  homunculus  spectacle  begins  following  the demonstration of alchemy creation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The assistant brings in a large glass flask with a black cloth draped over it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to Herme s’s explanation, the homunculus is about 40 weeks in maturation, maintained at body temperature, cultivated from human sperm or blood, allowed to putrefy in a distillation bottle, and the artificial life would emerge as it was mixed with human blood. It’s announced that the artificial life is obtained by culturing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There is no proof that it emerged from that process… I need to capture the process of growth using photographs.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen says it in a small voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That flask is meant to replicate the mother’s womb.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma speaks casually. Falma cannot comprehend the attempt to raise a person merely from using the sperm and the creation of an artificial uterus or placenta. However, it is wrong to try to culture only sperm or blood and not the fertilized egg. That should have been a verifiable case, but the knowledge of the human’s egg is not known in this world. It is a discussion that the people of this world will doubt what they’re hearing, as it is believed that women, like men, excrete sperms out of their vaginas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By the way, does Master Herme s have a normal human child? Or does he only have a homunculus, a non-human creature?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma asks Pierre. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“From what I’ve heard, it is a dwarf.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre isn’t very familiar with it either. Anyway, the audience’s expectations rise for the content within the flask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll follow up one question with you, but according to Falma-kun’s theory, there’s no life without an egg and sperms, right?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen is a reasonably enthusiastic reader of Falma’s medical and pharmacy textbooks, and she has gained various knowledge but not as much as Palle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At first, Ellen was skeptical about the existence of the human’s eggs, but she observed the corpse dissections initiated by the physician Claude, who was inspired by Falma’s textbook, and saw the actual follicles and cumulus oophorus[1]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma reminds her about the functional importance of the ovaries and testes as human’s reproductive  organs.  El en  has  a  different  understanding  from  the  blessing  of  the guardian deity and the fundamental knowledge of a fierce battle by the hundreds of millions of sperms over an egg, and that a human being is the final miraculous process born from one chosen sperm. The birth of life felt like a mystery to them in the past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen was touched by the knowledge for life’s mysterious occurrences and its birth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nn, I can’t say that I don’t understand, but I can’t deny it.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so, Falma stops speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you saying you can’t deny it?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, there will be a day when we will make full use of reproductive engineering.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen is filled with fear by Falma’s loaded statement in her own thoughts, “I wonder what happened to Falma-kun’s world.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">As she is pondering to herself, Herme s’s uplifting voice echoes throughout the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now I present to you, the homunculus. Take a look.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s finally here!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contrary to Ellen’s expectations, a faint voice leaks from Falma as he’s looking at the </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">flask with the black cloth removed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that is a dud.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma believes he cannot say anything stupid at this point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It appears like a dwarf wearing clothes in side the flask, with a height about about one finger tall. But from Falma’s perspective, it appears like something else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ooh… surely the dwarf is moving…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The audience doesn’t know any better gets excited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It looks like a human…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s pays attention to the crowd in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hate being seen closely because I’m nervous. Don’t get too close.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s alive. Mumu, this is unexpected.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierres suspects that this is a trick in using a corpse, but he must admit that it’s alive after seeing the dwarf’s movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not a fetal corpse. What do you think of it, Falma?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen inquires for Falma response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I say it’s a disappointment.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma faces them before providing the disappointing expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alopecia, or the hairless monkey, is wearing special make-up and a wig.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen and Pierre are about to scream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There is no such small monkey! It’s about the size of a finger? The hands and face are like humans themselves?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It has no fur!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre nods to Ellen’s descriptions in agreement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think it is the monkey, but not well known yet.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">On Earth, the pygmy marmoset monkey is only the height of a finger. The animals in this world don’t seem to be known to every corner of the world, so it’s easy to convince the people to believe in such a unique little monkey as something other-worldly in this world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t argue with that, but… if it is a monkey, what about its fur which is smooth from its skin to its fingertips? It doesn’t appear to be shaved.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No matter how human-like its appearance is, why does it have white eyes? Monkeys or other wild animals don’t have such a thing, aside from humans.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">The tricks to this magic are shabby…)</i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">As his conjecture of the homunculus is a fake, Falma quickly loses interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There should be a tail under the skirt. Even if it is cut, there are remnant traces. Well, I wonder if the skirt can be turned over somehow.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma finally begins to plot, stating that he wants to turn over its skirt. Falma admires that the legend of the homunculus can’t be terminated because it’s stated that it will die if it’s taken out of the container. They can’t even touch it for an examination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But just then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…!……!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">Hmm? </i>) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The mouth of the cosplay monkey, which is said to be a homunculus, is moving. It’s a movement of the mouth mimicking a speech while forming a word. And… maybe it realizes that others can’t hear its voice from inside the flask, it breathes on the wall of the flask and starts writing something that looks like letters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me… help this guy…?!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma is terrified of the sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oy… now, I think it’s enough.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s drapes the black cloth over the flash to block the view. He hands the flask containing homunculus over to the assistant alchemist and has her lower the flask into storage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just now… was it writing something?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma screams at the hosting alchemists to stop them, but his voice is drowned out in the noisy crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The homunculus indicated it understands human language, but… it appears just like graffiti. What was written?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems Pierre saw the same thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it made sense.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma acknowledges the monkey is as intel igent as humans, believing that any common sense can be broken. Herme s didn’t let him write to the end, as though he knew that this homunculus could write a human language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">The monkey wanted to tell about Hermès and his wrong doing… and it was asking for</i> <i class="calibre3">help. Then Hermès casually intervened to prevent it from telling its story. </i>) Falma has yet to know any of the monkeys on Earth that could write meaningful letters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even on Earth, if you let a monkey make random letters on the keyboard using infinite amounts of time, it would probably produce meaningful words someday. However, it would take a tremendous amount of universal time for it to completely write meaningful words for just over a dozen letters. In other words, the words written by the monkey that disguised as a homunculus was not a product of chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">It’s a strange phenomenon! </i>) </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did it write something like a letter just now?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">It occurs that the crowd also noticed it beside Falma, the scribbing-scribbing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Show it to us again!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">The guests that did not witness the event are excited by their curiosity when they hear the discussion and shout in unison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unfortunately, I can’t show it for too long… It’s a fragile creature, so if it’s in front of a lot of people for too long, it’ll hurt itself.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s refuses to show it again attempting to use a plausible reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Although it’s a substitute for this demonstration, let me show you another interesting thing…  Here  are  some  rose  seeds.  Place  the  philosopher’s  stone  next  to  it.  The philosopher’s stone will make the flowers bloom in 10 seconds from the seeds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He shows a wooden box full of flower’s seeds and closes the lid. While shaking the box, Herme s pretends to apply force onto the boxt and chants a spell. When he finishes the exaggerated spell and opens the box… The buds of roses, which have blossomed, are presented within the box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oooh !?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">The audience applauses. There is no longer reminiscent of the homunculus story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s going on !? Does the philosopher’s stone have the power to make flowers bloom from the seeds !? What does this mean?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen  is  unwilling  to  except  what  she  observes,  becomes  surprised  and  places  her glasses on again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was shaking the box. It doesn’t take a kid to notice this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma is not overlooking even the slightest movement made byHerme s. Herme s didn’t touch the inside, but was shaking the box instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was shaking… But why did the seeds become flowers if he was just shaking them?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The seeds were densely scattered on the buds. When you shake the container, the granular materials have large particles on top due to the granular convection effect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You can see it when you actually try it.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a phenomenon in which when you put particles of different sizes in a container and shake it, the largest particles gather at the top while smaller particles sink. That’s </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">what it’s called the Brazil Nut Effect on Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Brazil? What does that mean?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">Oh, there’s no Brazil nuts in this world because there is no Brazil</i>) Anyway, that’s how it is. Falma cheats with a proper declaration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s the selling point to finally push the audience to buy the philosopher’s stone.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre wipes his cold sweat, and says he nearly got dragged into the moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  are  several  other  exhibits,  but  none  of  them  falls  into  the  category  of  the elaborative  magic  tricks  that  can  give  rise  to  Falma’s  expectations  through  his observations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s  also  exhibits  off  what  is  called  a  chimeric  animal,  and  creates  humorous stories about the hardships that lead up to their developments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A snake with legs and a double-headed snake. They are not chimeric animals, but how they were born. Aaah. It’s a kind of malformation that happens occasionally.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma  replies  without  changing  his  facial  expression.  He  comments  that  the malformations are quite common in natural occurrences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not surprised.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a malformation I’ve seen before. The snake used to have legs.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">Maybe they are col ecting malformed animals… I think they have knowledge as a breeder. </i>) It is possible to realize that Herme s, from Falma’s observation so far, is a person with some skills and knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Falma-kun! A floating human body?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next, when the curtain opens, the female alchemist assistant who is hypnotised in front of Herme s is floating horizontally. Herme s reminds the crowd around the female alchemist during the demonstration that she is not suspended from the ceiling with threads or wires. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is she really floating?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s supported by a bent metal rod from around Herm’s abdomen to the underside of a woman’s body. If we use the same trick, Ellen should be able to do it as well.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, it is a kind of magic trick known for planting illusions. Falma explains to them as he sees through the trick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can she really be floating? After all, Falma can fly.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s is a top-notch scammer that manages to convince even El en, who is completely suspicious of Herme s. At this rate, the number of fraud victims will grow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the final demonstration, the Alchemy Study Group gathering ends with great success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you everyone for enjoying this evening to its finale. We look forward to a chance in seeing you again.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the venue closes, there are quite a few alchemists that want to buy the arcane arts from Herme s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">He can predict the number of participants from each meeting is going to increase every</i> <i class="calibre3">time based on the successes. </i>) </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  this  venue  is  viewed  purely  as  entertainment,  the  content  is  objectively satisfactory. The entrance fee is high, Herme s’s skillful talks are also good, and the entertainment is excellent. The guests are also likely to be satisfied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It looks like all the spectacles are over, Falma-sama. It was impressive overall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma agrees with Pierre’s words. There were six demonstrations in all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was unknowingly interesting. I can’t say everything I saw presented contained some sort of planted tricks, but how did Pharma understand everything within?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen is vexed that she couldn’t see through all the planted illusions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I understand it all, but it’s hard for everyone else to comprehend the illusions.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, does Falma deduce that all of these things we observed were all fake?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre summarizes his conclusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t it just an illusionary act of alchemy using tricks, phenomena that the ordinary people do not know about, or are you having prejudices against an alchemy?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">One thing that can be certain is that Falma statements about Herme s as an illusionist or entertainer is true, who can earn more using straightforward talks than a daytime swindler, even in broad daylight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But… Falma reflects about the entire event and squints upwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The only thing is the homunculus… it wasn’t just a monkey.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarding the homunculus, he has a suspicion about it other than regarding it as just a mere magic trick. Instead of Falma buying into it being a homunculus, or the reason why alchemists were disallowing them to see it again, Falma is disappointed that it was prematurely intervened before the monkey completed its sentence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma prefers he is not kept in the dark about what it truly was and stops believing it was merely a coincidence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What were you going to do? Were you going to peel off the cover of the monkey in the flask? I don’t mind waiting for your answer.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen grips her hands on her staff. Apparently, she is motivated with some kind of intention. On the other hand, Falma has a round waist in his dress. He couldn’t bring his staff because it is nighttime, and he would glow in the dark with his Medicine God’s staff. He doesn’t feel any danger while travelling about, even if he’s barehanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wonder if the home of homunculus should be identified.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have to come back.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">While leaving along with the guests as the venue closes, Falma’s party is suddenly being called out from behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening. Are you interested in any of the arcane techniques?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">If they recall the voice of a certain someone, it should belong to the female alchemist who was Herme s’s assistant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Herme s told me to invite you to another private room if needed.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are we special guests?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre’s voice is mixed with hesitation, revealing his cautiousness. However, Falma is willing to accept the suspicious invitation, and takes the other person’s explanation at face value. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was impressed by the secret techniques demonstrated tonight. I want to see the homunculus again. I’m considering buying the arcane technique.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…the homunculus, is it?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a long silence, but the female alchemist agrees to his demand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I understand, so please follow this way. Let me show it to you.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you!“ </p>
