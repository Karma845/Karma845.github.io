<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; Unveiling of New Products</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few days later, construction of the store was almost done and work began on procurement and production of merchandise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maids are now divided into production and sales teams, except for the minimum number of personnel for the mansion, and they are being moved to the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few days ago, potions were delivered for quality control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks in part to my careful instruction, the quality of the potions is second to none.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The variation in quality that tends to be a problem in mass production was no concern in the basic and middle-grade potions. As for high-grade potions, I can sell the ones I make for the time being, so there should be no problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for other items, I plan to sell daily necessities and miscellaneous goods for adventurers, like those sold at other merchant houses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While all these preparations were going on, Bohbee visited my mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are having a conversation in the reception room of the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Boss, I am finally here. Please take care of me from now on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You bet. My pleasure&#8230;well then, let’s get right to it, I would like to hear your opinion. It’s a new product that&#8217;s going to be the highlight of our company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A new product?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah—Sebas, please bring it over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I called out to him, Sebas brought the new product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He brought a white object in the shape of an oval doughnut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um, what am I looking at&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a—toilet seat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A toilet seat?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-33491180' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-33491180' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right. It’s a removable toilet seat with a hot water flush function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this world, there are still many pit toilets in the countryside, but in larger towns, sewage systems are well developed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And each household had either the Japanese-style and Western-style toilets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In urban areas, those who can use cleaning spells clean up with magic after doing their business, while others wipe with tissue paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water can also be poured down the drain by conjuring water magic, or by using the magic stones and magical tools provided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I came up with this product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a product that is installed in a sitting toilet, and has a magic stone built into it. By channeling mana through this part, the built-in tube extends, and after defecating, the toilet can be flushed with water and even dried with a warm air function. If you channel mana through this part, it is also possible to flush water. It also has a function to warm up to the proper temperature so that the buttocks don&#8217;t get cold.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I explained the product while holding it, but it didn&#8217;t seem to make much sense to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay&#8230;since you’re here, why don&#8217;t you give it a try?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, I went ahead and set up the toilet seat in the nearest bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s done, try using it. I&#8217;ll be waiting in the room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee walked into the bathroom with trepidation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I returned to the room, I heard a scream coming from the toilet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Should I go check it out?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nah, it’s all good&#8230;probably.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, I&#8217;m the only one who has used this product yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why Sebas didn&#8217;t know what was going on in the bathroom and was worried and asked me about it, but I stopped him.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTYzMzUyOTQ2OTciIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I don&#8217;t think Bohbee would be too psyched if he came over to take a look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few minutes later, Bohbee came slamming noisily back in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wh-What the hell is that thing?! So much that I don’t even wanna use the toilets I&#8217;ve been using so far no more!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was so surprised that he forgot to speak formally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded my head in satisfaction at Bohbee’s astonishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You think so too right. Oh right, Sebas. I want you to install them in the mansion, the employees&#8217; quarters, and in the store. I have a stock of them in the warehouse and I&#8217;ve prepared a manual on how to use them, so please go through it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hahahaa. I understand. This is going to be fun~&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas left the room with a smile on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve never seen Sebas looking so happy, sheesh!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was looking away from Sebas, Bohbee came up to me and excitedly opened his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want one of these in my house! Please sell me three units for my personal use!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoa, whoa, back up!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a dude come this close ain’t fun at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, you&#8217;re too close, back up a bit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oops, I’m sorry about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He backed away for the time being, but Bohbee seemed to be unable to control his excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed like we were getting nowhere, so I sighed and opened my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, I thought we should discuss the price first. I&#8217;m thinking of two gold coins for the type with the full specification with all functions for the nobles, and two large silver coins for a low-priced version without the warming and water-flushing functions, so that the common people can afford it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Japanese yen, a noble would pay 200,000 yen. And the common folk pays about 20,000 yen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The warming function always consumes mana, so it costs money to incorporate it. In addition, the material of the seat and the overall decoration will give it a luxurious feel and differentiate it from the low-priced version for the nobles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee puts his hand on his chin deep in thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah&#8230;I think that’s a fair price, maybe even a little low. But still, this is a revolution!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really? If Bohbee thinks so, then that’s reassuring&#8230;by the way, that one earlier was just a prototype for the nobles, and would actually look something like this when done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying so, I showed him the blueprints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is going to be pretty fancy, so I&#8217;ve prepared one for the mansion with the extra decorations removed. Which was the one I let Bohbee use earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Magnificent! This is nothing short of a masterpiece, boss, this would definitely make the nobles go crazy!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee looked at the blueprints and gave his approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whew, that’s a relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so, that means a lot coming from you. We&#8217;ll be launching in a week, and we&#8217;ll be offering discounts for a few days to celebrate the opening. I&#8217;m going to add new employees after I see how things go, so please keep your eyes peeled at your slave trading shop.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason I use slaves is to prevent information leaks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t want to leak the inside information of my store as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could hire ordinary people and use contract magic to bind their words and actions, but I cannot bind them that strongly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slave, on the other hand, can be bound strongly, and even if I decide to release them, I can make a contract that is somewhat more enforceable&#8230;and in the extreme, I could use magic to manipulate their memories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee nodded easily, as if he understood what I was thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess he’s aware that information leakage would be detrimental to the survival of the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You got it, boss. Also, would you like me to revert to you before I hire anyone?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-32855168' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-32855168' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I would like to hire people when I&#8217;m not here as well, so it’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After summarizing matters leading to the launch, Bohbee left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next few days were filled with meetings with Dillan and mock battles with Tendo and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others were able to improve more than expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gotta say, actual combat really is the most efficient method to improve after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day before the launch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the day before yesterday, the maids and employees have been distributing flyers to advertise the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of the store, I displayed an original product, the installation-type toilet seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flyers announced that the toilet seats were also installed in the store&#8217;s restrooms, so there was a line in front of the store even though the launch was scheduled for tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, there was no problem with the mass production of the toilet seats since the blueprints had been handed over to the employees. Since we now have more people with magic tool-making skills, we should be able to handle any increase in orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Me, Bohbee, Finne and Iris were at the store when Iris said something to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you have a minute, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;d like to have that installed in the royal castle as well&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, that’s it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course. Dillan has been very kind to me, so I made one customized for him. Well, would you like me to go deliver it now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;d love that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris&#8217;s eyes lit up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are only four of us here now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, Zero seems to have been training at Sebas’, while Tendo and the other heroes including Kusel are training at the mansion. Asha, Ephyr, and Noir are working at the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I turned to Finne, she nodded her head as if to say, no problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What about you, Bohbee? Wanna come with?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No thanks! An audience with His Majesty&#8230;I think I’ll pass!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You sure? He&#8217;s quite friendly you know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, I was confronted with a dumbfounded look from Finne.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, you’re probably the only one who can say such a thing! You do realize that, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-You think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I do!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got scolded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, we’re talking about the king of a nation. Finne’s reaction is probably normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee spoke to me, who was feeling down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry I am going to have to pass this time around. But maybe next time&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, I got to know Bohbee because Sebas introduced me to him, and I remembered that Sebas was originally Dillan’s butler. I wonder if Bohbee ever met Dillan?</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I&#8217;ll ask him about it next time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right. Well then, Finne, Iris, let&#8217;s go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We headed immediately for the royal castle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We told Thomas about our business at the castle gate, and he let us through right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, I was shown into the usual living room, but Dillan was not there and was asked to wait for a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, this time it&#8217;s going to be in the form of a formal audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris was summoned and left the room first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After another short wait, a maid entered the room after knocking on the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Master Haruto. His Majesty will see you now. Please come this way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okie~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow, still so carefree, huh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, just same as usual.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We followed the maid to the audience chamber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guard standing in front of the door urges us to stand in front of the audience chamber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Great Hero*, Master Haruto has arrived!” (TLN: Different from the titled heroes like his classmates)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prompted by the guard’s voice, the door opened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne next to me seemed as nervous as ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We walked to the center of the room, got down on one knee and bowed our heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I usually interact with Dillan in a rather casual manner, so when I greet him in a formal setting like this, it feels a little uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Raise your heads.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prompted by Dillan’s words Finne and I looked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been a while, Sir Haruto. What brings you here today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m pretty sure he must have gotten the gist from Iris already, but Dillan seems to be acting theatrical because it&#8217;s a formal setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right. Today, I have brought the MVP of my newly established trading company as a tribute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, The MVP you say?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan asked, leaning forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me show it to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took out a new lavishly decorated toilet seat from my dimensional storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it was a gift for the king, I added a few more decorations to the one meant for the nobles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here it is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attendant took the toilet seat from my hand and carried it to Dillan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;It’s kind of jarring seeing him hold the toilet seat so reverently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan took it in his hands and then went out of his way to ask, even though he should know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a multi-functional toilet seat that makes your bathroom experience more comfortable.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prime minister and ministers around Dillan also seemed to be interested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After taking a look at it one more time, Dillan handed it to the prime minister who was next to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I see&#8230;Rubel, please have it installed in my chamber immediately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The said prime minister—Rubel, took it then turned to me and asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sir Haruto. May I ask how to install it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I handed him the installation manual and explained it to him as we looked at it together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you very much. Then, Your Majesty, I will get to work on it immediately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubel said and left the audience hall with a few of his personal guards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan opened his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, Sir Haruto. How’s the staffing going in your new store?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right. I already have all the employees in place and everyone is anxiously awaiting the opening.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. That&#8217;s good to hear.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I purchased them from a slave trader named Bohbee, who also happens to be a very talented man&#8230;that I decided to have Bohbee himself help me out with my trading company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan was well aware of how I treat slaves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I omitted explaining that part because of that, but Dillan nodded his head somewhat agreeably.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I see. That guy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you perhaps know Bohbee?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan nodded at my question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do know him. He is a successful merchant with several businesses. He has a good reputation for his treatment of slaves, and all the nobles who have bought slaves from him hold Bohbee in high esteem. There are very few men as good as he is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s that reputable?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow, even the king acknowledged him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bohbee is not rough even with his criminal slaves. He does his best to make each slave find the hope of living as a human being. You were right to take him in, Haruto!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You bet. I got him good—I mean, nevermind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, you got him good, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You heard wrong. Pay it no mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I already switched back to my usual tone. I really am no good with this sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-It’s all right. It was about time you switched back to your usual tone anyway. The people here are very understanding&#8230;frankly speaking, I&#8217;m feeling a little uncomfortable myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then I will do just that, what a relief—so, about Bohbee, it seemed like he already had a successor, so I poached him to my trading company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I see. I guess things are going to get even more interesting. I can hardly wait to see you in action. As Iris&#8217;s father as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hahaa, I guess I better roll up my sleeves then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we were having such leisure conversation, Rubel, the prime minister, came back to report that he had installed the toilet seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—A few minutes later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey Haruto! That thing in there is ground-breaking! I’m going to have it installed in all the toilets in the castle!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With such excitement, Dillan returned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubel and the other ministers were so excited that their eyes were just short of popping out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I brought a total of ten to give away, so how many more do you need?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my words, Dillan turned to Rubel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s see&#8230;the total number of toilets in the castle is forty-five. If we subtract the ones you’re gifting this time, we’ll be needing thirty-five more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. Then we’ll order thirty-five more units.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand. There are two types of this product, a low-priced version and a version for nobles, and the one I brought today is exclusively for dedication, which is different from both. The only difference between the one for the nobles and the one for dedication is the decoration, so if you don’t mind I could deliver the version for the nobles?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one for the nobles costs five gold coins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I told this to Dillan, he said&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, that will be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it okay to deliver the day after tomorrow? Because I&#8217;ll be busy tomorrow on opening day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay then. The day after tomorrow it is. Do I pay in advance?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, same day is fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right then. You may be excused.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This concludes the audience.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne and I withdrew from the audience chamber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After waiting for Iris in the living room and joining her, we left the castle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Until the very end, Haruto was not nervous in front of His Majesty. Even your rigid formal speech broke off somewhere in the middle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On our way back home, Finne took a jab at me and laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No point getting all nervous now right. We&#8217;ve met so many times after all, I think it&#8217;s time you stop being nervous as well, Finne!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, easy for you to say&#8230;I just get nervous when it comes to a formal audience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Finne could say that, then it must be so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I returned to the store, I quickly informed the staff that an order had been placed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I called out to Bohbee, who was in charge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got a minute?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One moment, please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee finished his instructions and turned to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s up, boss?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m curious about the reaction of the other trading companies&#8230;how do you think our opening will affect them?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-13715972' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-13715972' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The other trading companies, sir? I guess it depends on how much products other than the toilet seats sell, so I can only come up with an estimate at most, is that okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure. I&#8217;m an amateur when it comes to running a business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could somehow predict what might happen, but I couldn&#8217;t be sure of the specifics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing my response, Bohbee puts his hand on his chin in thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um, I suppose&#8230;if the Ashtaroth Chamber of Commerce* makes enough profit to affect its surroundings, the survival of other trading companies will be at stake. In that case, they will go with the first trick in the book, which is spread bad publicity about the Ashtaroth Chamber of Commerce. Some of them might even send assassins as a hardline measure.” (TLN: Trading company)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that Bohbee is right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m still planning to bring out more new products in the future&#8230;so if the trading company thrives, that would mean more enemies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you really think there is a good chance of assassins coming after us?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honestly. I think there is a very good chance that there will be a lot of sabotage and attacks. I mean, it’s such a wonderful product, there is no doubt it’s going to make a lot of waves&#8230;I don’t think there will be anyone daring enough to pick a fight with the boss, who is an EX rank, but keep in mind this place is close to the aristocrat district, and the nobles have ties to trading companies, and most of them don’t play around with their interests. Bottom line is, it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to be prepared.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that&#8217;s true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Dillan rules this country, it’s safe to say that there probably aren’t that many weirdos, but I can’t say for sure that there aren’t any at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it. I&#8217;m making sure that the current employees are as competent as B-rank adventurers, but I think it would be better to increase security at night as well. At the very least, I&#8217;ll find someone capable of dealing with C-rank adventurers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dealing with C-rank&#8230;goodness me, are our current employees that strong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. They received training from me and the other members of the house&#8230;speaking of which, I’m wondering whether to train the new recruits the same way?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said it so easily that Bohbee was left absolutely speechless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good talk, glad we had this conversation. Okay then, I leave the recruitment to you. As always, scout from among the slaves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right. But when it comes to slaves, I will need your blood to conclude the contract&#8230;it would be impractical running to get your blood each and every time, and in cases where you are away from the country for an extended period, I won’t be able to recruit new employees at all. How do we resolve this boss?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, that&#8217;s true. Each time I hired a new employee these days, I gave him my blood in advance and had them conclude a contract with me using it.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm&#8230;how about, I designate one of the slaves as the master during the contract, is that possible?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, it is. In that case, boss would be the superior master, and can give out orders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, isn’t that convenient? Then, I would go with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I immediately called Benak and Hatra, who were working nearby. They were the three slaves that I bought along with their daughter Hayna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, Hayna was carrying goods a little distance from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How may I be of assistance, master?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benak asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I informed them that there might be an attack tonight, and that I will be increasing the number of slave employees to prepare for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Hatra was a bit jumpy at the mention of an attack, I assured them that there was no need to be frightened as they already possess the strength equivalent to a B-rank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The employees dispatched here will be an asset when we open our next store&#8230;so, I want you, Benak, to conclude the contract with the new slaves on my behalf.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you fine with me, sir?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve seen how hardworking you are. So I know that I can entrust this to you. You will work with Bohbee picking out the slaves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-Thank you, sir!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I instructed him to do so, Benak’s eyes teared up and he bowed his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take the new employees directly to the employees&#8217; quarters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes sir, as you wish.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Bohbee asked me.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-95707731' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-95707731' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Speaking of which, boss, what about slaves with physical defects? I mean fixing them up is a piece of cake for you boss, but what shall we do in your absence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoops, there is that too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry. I will prepare a potion that can heal physical defects, so if you find someone who seem capable, buy them and use the potion on them. Oh, and be sure to only use the potion in the mansion or in the quarters to avoid any commotion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A potion to cure physical defects?! Isn’t that an elixir&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee clamored in surprise at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benak and Hatra were also speechless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m not going to sell this, so don’t worry. How about, I prepare a secured magic bag that only the three of you and the people in the mansion can access, I’ll put it in that bag and hand it over to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them nodded deeply, saying, &#8220;Understood”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bohbee will assist you with the slave selection at first, but once you get familiar with the process, he will leave it completely to you, Benak. Once Benak purchases the slaves, Bohbee will train them as employees. When he&#8217;s finished with that, they will then begin combat training.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, sir&#8230;the sooner the better, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well&#8230;it&#8217;s best to get right to it as soon as possible, so once the store opens and things settle down a bit, you can get to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them nodded at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess I can rest easy now.</span></p>
