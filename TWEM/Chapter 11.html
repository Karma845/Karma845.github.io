<h2>Chapter 11 &#8211; Fighting the Devil</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was standing in the air using my Sky Walk skill, facing Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a quick glance, I could see that even I would not be able to break the barrier that enveloped the entire holy city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Ellis might be able to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;What do you think, Ellis? Can you destroy it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;It is possible, but it will take some time.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, so it&#8217;s possible. How long?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Calculating&#8230;without confronting Schwartz, the time it would take to destroy the barrier is ten minutes.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, so you&#8217;re saying that it&#8217;s faster to take him down first since he’s going to sabotage us anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tsk, what an annoying barrier.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am honored by your praise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz bowed gracefully in response to my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Aegis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put up Aegis below me to prevent the city from being affected by the battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegis repels any physical interference by creating a spatial rupture between the layers of the barrier, but its only drawback is that, it doesn&#8217;t prevent mental attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I guess I just need to make Schwartz focus on only me and prevent him from unleashing any kind of mental attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see that you’ve made it so that the damage doesn’t spread. How unfortunate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that——so!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I unleashed Explosion, which compressed a huge amount of magic power, towards Schwartz as I said that. A fist-sized fireball approached Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Abyss Sphere.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Schwartz released a sphere that seemed to be similar to condensed darkness. When my explosion hit the sphere, it got sucked into it and disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he continues to use that technique, my magic attacks will most likely be rendered useless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that case——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took advantage of my physical abilities and moved right in front of Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was caught by surprise and tried to retreat, but it was too late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I lowered my posture and——unleashed a single swordflash using quickdraw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just like that, my blade severed Schwartz&#8217;s left arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh&#8230;this is going to cost you, just so you know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz gritted his teeth, but no blood flowed out of the cut wound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, looking closely, I could see a black misty substance oozing out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz swung his right arm at me while I was observing him in a casual manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Devil&#8217;s Claw!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The claws on Schwartz&#8217;s right hand extended and charged toward my torso.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">——It’s too late to dodge it!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly raised my hands to guard myself in a defensive stance and strengthened my entire body with Diamond, the higher tier of Harden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Schwartz&#8217;s claws hit me squarely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While being blown several meters away, I twisted my body and adjusted my stance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at my arms, I saw deep cuts with blood pouring out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I hadn&#8217;t activated Diamond, both of my arms would have been cut right off&#8230;come to think of it, this is my first time bleeding since receiving my ability from god, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this, Schwartz narrowed his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And here I was about to cry out in triumph&#8230;so that’s how it is, you were disguising your status and concealed your skills.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guess he found out, huh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that it matters anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used recovery magic to close the wound. I have the Auto Healing skill, but it would take too long to heal this wound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good grief, what a nasty skill.&nbsp; Don’t you find it unfair using recovery magic?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used time-space magic to teleport behind Schwartz, but he must have read my move, and prepared his claws the moment I appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly repelled it with my blade and kicked Schwartz in the gut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Schwartz was blown away, I unleashed light magic to follow up, assuming that a devil should be vulnerable to attacks containing light and holy attributes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Holy Javelin.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magic I unleashed was about to strike Schwartz, but exploded just before it did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m afraid magic of that level won’t be nearly enough to defeat me, my friend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz appeared unharmed from the explosion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems to have been canceled out by some kind of magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then I should reciprocate——Dark Javelin.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right in front of Schwartz, hundreds of arrows, not unlike the ones I had just fired, emerged and were released.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No friggin chance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I fired the same number of Holy Javelins to cancel them out, but some of them slipped through and came at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I avoided them with only minimal movement, while pointing my hand in the form of a finger gun at Schwartz, gathering magic power at the tip and releasing it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me see how you’ll deal with this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz, who was avoiding some of my Holy Javelins that also slipped through, was surprised to see a completely different attack, but easily avoided it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, that caught me by surprise. What a neat trick I have to say. Then, allow me to also show you something interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was alerted by his words, four glowing magic circles appeared behind him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Summon Devil&#8217;s Gate”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four demons emerged from the magic circle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of them had androgynous-looking human forms, and I could sense that they possessed fairly decent strengths from their presences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re probably high-ranking devils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five devils, including Schwartz, would be a bit troublesome&#8230;Do I have to use the skill that increases the power of my physical abilities and skills by five times, Limit Break?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, go get rid of him. And if you’re unable to kill him, at least try and buy me some time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““““Yes sir!””””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four devils bowed to Schwartz and came straight at us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tsk, how troublesome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at Schwartz with a sideways glance, and it doesn’t seem like he was going to join the fray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is he really just going to let the devils under his command take care of me? Yeah right, the fact that he&#8217;s trying to buy time, could be that he’s probably preparing to use some kind of large-scale magic?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d better take care of these ones first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Holy Judgment!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment I chanted that, a thick pillar of light descended from the sky and enveloped the devils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ug-Ugh,arghhaaaaaa!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The devils screamed in agony as their bodies were reduced to ashes and simply vanished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I turned to look at Schwartz——he was gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You gotta be kiddin’ me, in that split second I focused my attention on those devils? And here I thought he was preparing to invoke magic!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where are you looking? I’m right here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after the detect crisis went off, a voice called out from behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with Schwartz, who can move at such high speed as my opponent, it would be too late to turn around and prevent the attack. And there’s nearly not enough time to activate teleport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dammit, I guess he leaves me no choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Limit Break!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugghhhh?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I activated my skill and at the same time, released my magic power and blew Schwartz away behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz positioned himself at some distance away from me and smiled amusedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kufufufuu! How enthralling, this is so much fun! A battle ought to be like this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How about you shut the fuck up!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I closed in on Schwartz and gave him a fist full of light magic to the gut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My speed also became much faster than before, so it seemed that he could not avoid it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Guhaaa!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m not done yet, just so you know! Killer move——Judgment Blow!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not really a killer move or anything, just simply hitting the shit out of him with my fist covered in light magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the continuous blows from my current physical abilities must seem like a thousand-hand Avalokitesvara to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fughh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I continued with the barrage for a while and finally hit him as hard as I could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz was blown away again, but this time he barely managed to regain his stance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks like he felt this one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh, ggh&#8230;you’ve really gone and done it this time, haven’t you&#8230;but it’s still far from over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t say? Then allow me to end it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said that and pulled out my blade, Schwartz smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kufufufu, now you’re talking. Come on out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then a jet-black sword appeared from the void right beside Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not as powerful as the sword Zero has, but it looks hella strong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Here I come.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz&#8217;s figure blurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fuck, so he can still tune up his speed!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as detect danger was triggered and I crouched down as quickly as I could, his sword passed above my head——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sword then suddenly stopped directly above me, and the blade swung downward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly blocked it with my blade, but the impact was heavier than I could have imagined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried tripping him up by sweeping his foot while still crouched down, but Schwartz leapt backward and easily evaded it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What an incredible reflex. Then, how about this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz swung his sword and several purple slashes came flying at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I swung my sword as well to create slashes to counteract them, but the slashes were probably a decoy, as Schwartz himself was coming right at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I blocked the sword aiming at my neck with my blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, we began exchanging blows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We clashed violently, and the number of wounds on each of our bodies increased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz had more wounds, but none of them were fatal, and it would be a waste of time to continue hacking down at each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Pandemonium*!” (TLN: Lit. Magic Battle)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then buffed myself with a skill to further increase my physical abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crimson magic power began to overflow from my body, clinging to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it was forcefully activated, the burden on the body was considerable, but I couldn’t help it in this situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until a moment ago, the weakened me and Schwartz&#8217;s strength were balanced, but I wonder now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What an unbelievable amount of pressure! Fine. Let me follow suit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz smiled, and almost immediately, magic power and pressure started overflowing from his body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magic power that overflowed from Schwartz flurried and became a storm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps he used a skill similar to limit break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz and I glared at each other silently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufufuu, here I come again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exact moment I heard his voice, Schwartz appeared in front of me and swung his sword downward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I dodged and swung my sword in counter, but——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Afterimage?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz&#8217;s body, which I had sliced, dissipated into a black mist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was surprised, and without a moment to react, I raised the sword above my head following detect danger, and at the same time, a high-pitched metallic sound rang out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, can’t believe you actually blocked that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What can I say, I have a keen intuition.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so? But——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz distanced himself from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess this is it. It was quite fun though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s he talking about?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Hey, what’s the rush, how about we keep the fun alive for a little while?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nah. Think I’ve had enough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Schwartz&#8217;s words, a huge magic circle with a purple glow appeared under my feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇ ◇ ◇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina was watching the battle between Haruto and the devil unfolding in the sky above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aftermath of their battle won’t affect the holy city thanks to the barrier that Haruto put up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina, in fact, everyone who could wield magic in the holy city was astonished at the amazing barrier that Haruto had deployed over the entire city in an instant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to an attack as powerful as the Demon Lord’s, each attack is a lethal blow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Haruto&#8217;s barrier prevented all of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Amazing&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain nodded his head next to Ilmina who let out her voice unintentionally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So is Zero, but still Haruto is amazing. He&#8217;s fighting an opponent we were too scared to even look in the eye, while protecting the entire holy city&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s true. He is the one and only hope we have left now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina agreed with Gawain&#8217;s words and quietly looked at Haruto, their last hope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folding her hands together in prayer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intense battle had been going on for a while, but then crimson magic power erupted from Haruto’s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sheer force of this power was felt tinglingly by Ilmina and the others who were watching from below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s with this pressure, this extraordinarily dense amount of magic power&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My god, he’s still hiding this much power?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Ilmina and Gawain looked up at the crimson magic power that was surging to the heavens and muttered, tremendous pressure was also released from Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battle between the two from that point on was truly a fierce one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they crossed swords, the shockwaves generated from the exchange shook the barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battle of those who stood at the top of this world, allowing no outside intervention, was being waged up there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Gawain were to join this battle, he would not last a minute——scratch that, not even a few seconds before getting himself killed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain and the holy knights clenched their fists in frustration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina, too, was feeling frustrated at her inability to help Haruto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still believing in Haruto&#8217;s victory, she looked up to the sky.</span></p>
