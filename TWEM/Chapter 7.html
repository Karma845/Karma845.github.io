<h2>Chapter 7 &#8211; Emergency</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I, Haruto and the others were chatting after finishing our meal, my guild card, which was on the table, suddenly lit up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is&#8230;an emergency quest?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I recall, during the monster flood that appeared in the north of the royal capital of Perdis, my card also glowed in this way, announcing an emergency quest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I turned to Finne and the others——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing here. Ours isn’t glowing like that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne replied on behalf of the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently my card is the only one glowing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why only me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Only one way to find out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the time being, I checked my card and——next thing, my eyes widened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s the matter, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris asked, seeing the look on my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an emergency designated commission.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An emergency designated commission?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I immediately checked the details of the quest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The card reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> .</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mind froze for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina is missing? Nah, that can’t be right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone who was looking at the card stiffened as I did, and Iris finally opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-Ilmina is missing&#8230;H-Haruto!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is one helluva an emergency. Especially if we’re talking about a saint gone missing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was she targeted? By whom? Besides, isn&#8217;t a cathedral supposed to be well guarded?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;No, there’s no time for this, I should better get to the Adventurers&#8217; Guild first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll be going alone on this one. I can&#8217;t risk putting you all in harm’s way now that I don’t even know what or who we are dealing with&#8230;oh, Zero, you coming? You’re probably bored out of your mind anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked, thinking that Zero, who at the very least, is competent enough to handle any situation, should have no problem coming along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, not at all, It’s been a long time since I&#8217;ve been outside, so I won’t say I’m bored.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh okay, so you’re not coming then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he’s not coming along, then I’d just have him keep everyone safe&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh no.  I&#8217;ll go with you. I have a feeling it’s going to be fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Zero meant by “fun” must be something like being able to fight a strong adversary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right. Then let&#8217;s go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was about to get up and leave, Iris called out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to save Ilmina! She&#8217;s my dear friend!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tears were about to fall from Iris&#8217; eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She must hold her very dearly, and that’s why she’s so worried about her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could pretty much make it out from the way Iris and Ilmina interacted with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am sure that Iris would really like to head there herself. However, she probably understands that the reason she didn’t receive the notification is because she might become a liability, and instead reeling it in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I patted Iris on the head and smiled to reassure her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Leave it to me.  I&#8217;ll be sure to bring her back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tha, thank you&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not sure what’s going on, so I want everyone to be extra vigilant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing everyone nodding their heads and Iris wiping her eyes, I headed for the Adventurers&#8217; Guild along with Zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we arrived at the guild, it was empty, probably because of the time of day, and there were no adventurers in sight, except the staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I showed my adventurer card to the receptionist and asked her about the situation, and she bowed nervously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-Oh, we have been expecting you, Master Haruto!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it&#8217;s not every day you see an emergency designated commission from the Pope, so I guess it’s only normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;It’s quite unlikely that her reaction is because she’s talking to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Sister sitting over there is going to take you to the Cathedral. There you will hear directly from His Holiness the Pope.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After completing the formalities, I called out to the Sister.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am done with the paperwork. We can leave now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right.  Let&#8217;s go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sister stood up, bowed to the staff, and left the guild.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seems to be a polite and very likable person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, we’ll be running all the way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way to the cathedral, the Sister looked at Zero as if she wanted to say something, but said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero and I were taken to a room and waited for a while, and then the Sister who had gone to call Pope Liebert came back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She opened the door, and a man in white vestments walked in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He must be the Pope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Greetings, my name is Liebert Heilig, and I am the Pope. I am also Ilmina’s father, but please feel free to call me Liebert&#8230;I thank you from the bottom of my heart for accepting my request.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, too, introduced myself to Liebert, who bowed his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am Adventurer Haruto. You may call me Haruto, Liebert.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, I will do just that. Oh, and you don’t need to speak in a formal manner. Especially since you’re an adventurer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand. Then I will just talk as I normally do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert nodded in satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he looked at Zero, who was standing diagonally behind me, and opened his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who is that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He is my butler. And I assure you he is even more capable than an S-rank adventurer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero stepped forward and introduced himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My name is Zero, and I am Master Haruto’s butler. Pleased to make your acquaintance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, Zero, likewise. Now, I will begin the explanation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert prefaced his explanation with this and explained the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The circumstances surrounding Ilmina&#8217;s disappearance and the disturbing activities that had been going on for some time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After listening to the whole story, I asked Liebert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are the holy knights doing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are currently out searching for her.  But they have not been able to locate her yet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert looked frustrated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then came a knock on the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s Gawain Hazark. May I come in?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please come in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Liebert said this, the door opened and a knight in silver armor entered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had short platinum blond hair and eyes as blue as the sky. He was a handsome young man with fine facial features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After glancing at me and Zero, the Gawain fellow walked up to Liebert and went down on one knee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve been searching all over the holy city, but we have yet to locate Lady Ilmina.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that, so&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They still haven’t found Ilmina it seems. Liebert was visibly discouraged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is something the matter?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain looked at me and Zero and spoke out curiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing this, Liebert then took the opportunity to introduce us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right, I didn&#8217;t tell you this, Captain Gawain. This is Haruto, an adventurer, and his butler, Zero.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then introduced myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nice to meet you. I am Haruto, an adventurer. I&#8217;m here at the request of Liebert. Please call me Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sir Haruto, is it? My name is Gawain Hazark, the captain of the Holy Knight Order of the Holy State of Belifaire. Please call me Gawain. And you may address me freely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay. Pleasure to meet you, Gawain. Oh and you don&#8217;t have to call me ‘sir’.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero also introduced himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My name is Zero, and I am Master Haruto’s butler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain said to Zero, “Pleased to meet you”, and turned to Liebert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Holiness. Is Haruto the one you requested with the designated commission? He’s still very young though?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you talking about? Haruto is that infamous EX-rank adventurer, just so you know. I am sure you’re also familiar with that name, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, Gawain looked at me in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I brought out my adventurer card to prove it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-It really is true.  Meaning, he will be joining the search as well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert affirmed Gawain&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s just as you heard. May I request this of you, Haruto? As for the reward, I will give you whatever you want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Holiness, that&#8217;s too much!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s all right. It&#8217;s all to get Ilmina back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They seem to be thinking that I’m going to demand they pay a fortune or something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly interrupted them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t need to worry about that, okay?  Iris already asked me to rescue her friend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iris?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain tilted his head at the sudden mention of the name, while Liebert on the other hand looked at me as if to say, are you sure?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess Liebert must have heard about my relationship with Iris from Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded, and Liebert explained to Gawain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lady Iris is the first princess of the Kingdom of Perdis. Also, I heard from Ilmina that she is also Haruto’s fiancée&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, that&#8217;s right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Gawain was surprised and looked at me again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gee, he gets surprised so easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh&#8230;Haruto, please forgive me for my earlier rudeness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain bowed his head, he’s probably referring to him calling out the name of the princess of a country flippantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh please.  Raise your head.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris wouldn&#8217;t mind, and so I asked Gawain to raise his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gotta admit though, Gawain seems to be quite a good guy, bowing to me right away like that. He&#8217;s a good-looking guy too, I bet he must be very popular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was thinking about that, Liebert said to me,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, Haruto, will you be joining Captain Gawain in the search?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining the search, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m sure the knights are probably looking for Ilmina’s whereabouts by foot, but I should be able to find her using Map.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ll ask Ellis if she knows where Ilmina is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Understood, Master. Searching for the whereabouts of Ilmina Heilig&#8230;location found. Please take a look at the map.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did as told and checked the map, and sure enough, a red dot was marked on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will be damned&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To join the search, huh, I am afraid that won’t be necessary.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto! What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, what do you mean by that&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain glared at me with a hoarse voice, and Liebert asked curiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked into Liebert&#8217;s very serious eyes and answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What would be the point of searching when I already know where she is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert and Gawain were surprised that I already found her whereabouts within a few minutes, even though the entire knight order had been mobilized for the search all this while with no luck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain then asked, putting himself on guard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How do you know where she is? Are you perhaps one of them, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, I see. I can understand why he would think so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shook my head hastily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh no, no, I have a skill that’s handy for something like this. By the way, her location is in a building west of here. She’s probably in a basement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And how do you know so much?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there’s no point lying about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just told you. It&#8217;s one of my skills. I’m not going to go into the details though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;No, of course, I understand that adventurers don’t readily disclose their abilities. At any rate, you’re a godsend. Now please lead the way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain, who seemed to be convinced by my words, turned to Liebert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, Your Holiness, I will be going with him!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m counting on you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got up from my seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Now then, let’s get to work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these words, I, Zero, and Gawain left the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We left the cathedral and started running in the direction of Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right. I should check with Ellis to see if Ilmina is still alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Yes, I have confirmed that she is still alive.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good, that&#8217;s all I need to know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much longer till we get there?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Plotting out the shortest route&#8230;done.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The route immediately came up on the map, and then I followed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s nighttime, so there are no pedestrians. It was so lively in the daytime, but now it&#8217;s eerie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could see the occasional reflection of armor in the city, as if the holy knights were moving around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we approached the building where Ilmina was supposed to be, a few hundred meters away, I saw multiple people&#8217;s reactions on the map and detected their presence. They’re probably guarding the building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three of them right in front of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Gawain and Zero seemed to have noticed and nodded</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were advancing cautiously, but when we reached a certain distance, they seemed to have taken notice of us as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I glanced to the side and saw Gawain&#8217;s silver armor glinting in the moonlight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gawain, your armor gave us away&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, that can’t be&#8230;right!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nah, it’s definitely you, I mean that dude’s eyes are completely fixed on you&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, one of the men got impatient and raised his voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“C-Captain Gawain?!&nbsp; Why is he here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the?! Have we been found out?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn it, let&#8217;s get rid of them!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew it, so they’re enemies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s your fault that we got found out, Gawain, so you take care of them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, come on!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, jokingly, and Gawain immediately rushed in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh sheesh.&nbsp; There&#8217;s three of them as well, so we&#8217;ll take them each.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an instant, we closed in on the enemy and successfully neutralized them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain and I only knocked out targets, but Zero had easily suffocated him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s just like you, Zero. So merciless.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“May I take that as a compliment?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, it&#8217;s a compliment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you very much for the compliment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain, who was listening to the exchange, opened his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A-Are you really a butler? It seems like you moved at a much faster pace than I did just now&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s probably your imagination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;ll be a pain explaining Zero’s identity, so I&#8217;ll just shrug it off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;You think so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. Okay then, we’ve got no time to be slacking off. Let&#8217;s move on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“G-Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He still seems a little suspicious, but I guess that&#8217;s enough to fool him for now, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we approached the building, we saw armed men standing guard. And some of them seemed to have noticed something unusual, perhaps they heard some noise when we took out the three from earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are quite a lot of them, so let&#8217;s split up and get rid of them. We&#8217;ll meet up just before the entrance to the building&#8230;behind the building over there. Try to reduce their numbers as much as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my words, Gawain ran to the right and Zero to the left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distance to the building wasn’t far, but the number of enemies was way too large.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is still the best way to reduce the overall number of enemies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I proceeded to steadily defeat the nearby enemies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the people&#8217;s presence on the Map were disappearing one by one, I kept going and arrived at the rendezvous point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short time later, Zero and then Gawain arrived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How was it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It went smoothly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No problems here either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now all we have to do is get into that building, but&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ones loitering around the building. I could just take care of them with magic, easy enough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can you really do that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then I think you should. If we move around like we did before in a place like this, the ones inside the building are bound to notice for sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain agreed, and I activated my Accelerated Thought skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the map, the number of enemies is twelve. There are two on each of the four sides of the building and one each in the middle to act as support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, explosions are out of the question. The sound alone would give us away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, fire and light attribute magic are no go as well, the brightness will quickly draw attention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which leaves either wind or ice attribute magic then?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After releasing accelerated thought, I tried asking Gawain as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the captain of the Holy Knight Order, he also has subordinates and is probably familiar with this kind of situation, so I wanted to hear his opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gawain, how would you approach this situation?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a little tricky. But could maybe try getting in from above?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoa, I didn&#8217;t even consider that!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Makes sense since there are no guards up there, and if we can find a way in, we can easily sneak inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see, it shouldn’t be a problem if it’s just me alone, but&#8230;what are you going to do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain nodded to my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll draw them away. It should buy me some time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay. Zero, please go with Gawain and support him as much as you can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero bowed gracefully. While I said to Gawain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Zero is very strong, so use him as you like.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I left the place after getting a nod from Gawain. I immediately landed on the second floor of the target building, in a room with an open window, making full use of my stealth and conceal presence skills, as well as my airwalking skill, sky walk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ll leave the rest to you then, Gawain and Zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While thanking Gawain in my mind for taking care of the enemies outside the building, I finished off those guarding the second floor, although they were few in number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little later, the second floor was under control, and at the same time, a gut-wrenching sound roared around me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seems like they’ve gotten started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇ ◇ ◇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain watched Haruto leave, then turned to Zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can you use explosive magic, Sir Zero?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, could you please release them into the air after a little while? I want to get as many of them out of the building as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thought that this would make it easier for Haruto to get to the lower floors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero, too, had guessed his intention and obediently complied, and was preparing the magic, but Gawain, sensing the rising mana, was inwardly breaking out in a cold sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew that he was strong, but he didn’t expect him to possess such an absurd amount of magic power. If he had antagonized him or Haruto&#8230;with such thoughts crossing his mind, he was deeply relieved that they were on the same side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Releasing now——Explosion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magic that Zero unleashed exploded far above the sky in a huge roar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The might of the explosion was far from the one Gawain was used to. He broke out in a cold sweat, imagining what would have happened if it had been released near the holy city instead of so high up in the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is this good enough?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“S-Sure&#8230;thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero noticed Gawain&#8217;s bewilderment, but dared not mention it. Since it was unnecessary at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain opened his mouth and announced in a loud voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to draw the enemy&#8217;s gaze and attention toward him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is Gawain Hazark, Captain of the Holy Knights! We, the Holy Knights, already have you surrounded! Surrender yourselves without any useless resistance!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these words, Gawain launched a ball of light into the sky. Like a flare, it brightly illuminated the area around the building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ball of light was also a signal for the Holy Knights to assemble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Holy Knights, who had been searching the city, headed for the light at once. </span></p>
