<h3>Chapter 7: Rotavirus Infection and Abandoned Child</h3>


<p class="calibre1">The Empress’s cane is thrown into the clear sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Violent  Flame!”  <i class="calibre3">(T/L  Note:  Flame  Violations  is  a  poor  substitute  for  an  aggressive</i> <i class="calibre3">command from the wild Empress with Les violations de la flamme)</i> The moment the cast is made, the  <i class="calibre3">place (T/L Note: the plain near the Imperial City of</i> <i class="calibre3">San Flueve as no one is foolish enough to invoke an inferno around forests/hillsides with</i> <i class="calibre3">wildlife)</i> becomes a sea of fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whirlwind of a large flame scorches the wilderness on the outskirts of the Imperial City, and burns down a vast area at glance. Some of those who witnessed the event feel suffocated by the large consumption of oxygen by the blaze. Since the blaze travels downwind, the caster is not wrapped in smoke; however, if humans are caught with that violent flame, not even bones or shadows would remain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is terrible. The land of such a vast area turned into scorched soil in a short time…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon, who became the Empress’s theological adviser, witnesses the sight of the lifeless land that was swifted away. The massive flame was violent enough to burn the clothes that he wore even when he casted a water Art User’s elemental ice barrier around him for protection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the Empress casted a flame inferno, there will be no living plants left to be seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are small amounts of lingering divine power that ponded on the ground. The Empress is unquestionably the current strongest god among the gods in the world beside Falma, who is currently possessed by Medicine God, amongst human beings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, I’m exhausted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Empress, exposed directly to the hot air of the inferno, sweats slightly on her forehead, drinks water in satisfaction, unties her hair, and puts on her jacket back on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  new  Empress’s  aid,  Salomon,  takes  a  sigh  of  admiration  at  the  beautiful  and impressive divine technique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her power has not declined at all while in office. Who dares to turn against the Empire, or  takes  on  the  Empress  alone  as  enemies?  At  the  time  when  the  war  begins,  the country  will  sink  into  a  sea  of  fire.  That  terrifying  divine  technique  for  the  sea  of inferno has been further refined and magnified in power by the guidance of Salomon in detail. Of course, this test at the outskirts of the Empire is not a bloody battlefield… </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you Your Majesty, the Empire’s Empress, for invoking the wildfire!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This will produce good grass in the near future. Cattle will be happy if they have young shoots!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rancher is quite impressed to see the great divine technique up close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um, keep cows away so they don’t inhale the smoke.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is an annual event for the Empress to burn the grazing fields under the Empire’s management once a year. The Empress’s divine art training that can use ultra-wide flame divine art is limited to the desert, sea, and grazing field. This divine art is too powerful for her to use during peacetime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is the range of ability of Your Majesty’s current divine skill?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon asks. She observes the gauge on her cane, which has a meter that measures </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">double rating of the common divine power meter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It seems to be at 70%. It was a good exercise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Solomon smiled wryly. She appears like an innocent girl. Solomon continues to ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By the way, how much power does Falma have? He doesn’t wants to give up training for Falma. He’s not a blunt person to declare his intention.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the case of Falma, if he uses even 1%, the empire will be destroyed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon sighs as he thinks it requires daily training in the divine art is necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why do you want to understand the power of Falma?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By comparing, one can gauge his power with the power of successive guardian deities in the scriptures.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Empress’s eyes, Salomon is quite clever to bring up the idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If that is the case, I wonder if there is remaining power for other sacred nations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma stated that he would go back to the Great Shrine at the Holy City and the Empress has  initiated  her  first  move  to  notify  the  Great  Shrine.  She  mentions  to  Solomon Falma’s purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It seems that he desires to return the treasure wand of the Great Church. However, Falma is a dignitary of the Empire and my chief pharmacist, so I’m not going to send him  to  the  Holy  City.  If  he  needs  to  return  it,  send  it  with  a  messenger.  If  Falma disappears from the Empire without notice  <i class="calibre3">(T/L Note: kidnapped)</i> and harm is done to Falma, I will declare war on the Holy City on the same day. Since there is no one who can detain Falma other than the Holy City, it can be regarded as the work of the Holy City without further evidence. If there is a need to meet with Falma, have them meet him in my presence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since Falma has been targeted, the Holy City must gain consent from the Empire. A reply came back indicating that it is not necessary to return the holy treasure wand while the Empress has Falma in her custody as her primary pharmacist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma  is  surprised  when  the  Empress  reports  the  letter  to  Falma.  The  Empress’s </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">authority shuts down the Great Church of the Holy City. Falma cannot lose Salomon and desires Solomon’s safety. In this regard, the Empress wonders how the history book will be adjusted later. The Great Church cuts all communication with Falma. The Empress has her aides search for clues to the Holy Spring as Falma can no longer ask the Great Church for information. However, Falma mentions that that the priests of the Imperial Capital’s local church come often to the Different World Pharmacy to buy medicines… </p>
<p class="calibre1">The current date is April of 1147. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of Palle’s leukemia chemotherapies, additional consultations by Falma to prevent a relapse and the result is favorable. Palle also visits Bruno’s (his father) place on good days. Little by little, he begins to take over as the chief pharmacist for Bruno’s and  Falma’s  patients.  Bruno  wants  to  immerse  himself  in  running  the  San  Fleuve Imperial School of Pharmacology University, and Falma has to deal with the Different World Pharmacy along with other things. So Pal e has been deemed as the best successor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle is quite skilled, his knowledge and communication are good, and his reputation is not worse than that of Bruno. In addition, he begins to accumulate favorable results by treating patients who could not be cured by Bruno’s diagnosis and treatments by using new drugs from Falma.Palle often appears at Falma’s pharmacy mainly to stock up on new medicine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think the patient has this kind of illness, but I want to use this medicine instead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And this is how it goes between Falma and Palle. Falma confirms the symptoms and various observable test results provided by Palle, and if Falma believes the diagnostic is correct, Falma hands over the medicine. Palle uses the camera to provide the photos, which are very helpful in explaining the conditions of the patient. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, Falma directly goes to the patient after informing Palle. Palle is still two years behind Falma in becoming the first-class pharmacist, but he has begun to practice first-class pharmacist training with patients. Palle’s life is quite fulfilling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle comes to Falma’s pharmacy one afternoon and enters through the backdoor with an  unusual  action.  He  normally  comes  through  the  front  door,  but  it  seems  that something is wrong. He whispers to the pharmacy’s staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is Falma around?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s wrong with that child? Is that Palle’s secret child?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">El en asks Pal e as she stares at the infant who appears to be a few months old in Palle’s arm. However, the baby did not cry energetically like a common child, and seems to be feeble. Furthermore, the infant’s face and hair are full of grime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The child may be abandoned and dehydrated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Palle examines by pricking the facial area of the infant, vomit is seen around the mouth. There is no tension on the skin, and the area around the eyes is depressed. As Palle lightly pinches the skin on the back of the baby’s hand, the skin does not return to its original elasticity and remains in a chevron shape. This is one way to detect signs of dehydration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The infant’s breath is light and low heart beats. In the meanwhile, Falma prescribes all the prescriptions for the patients who are rushing to the pharmacy and hands the prescriptions to the part-time pharmacists  <i class="calibre3">(T/L Notes: probably Roger, Rebecca, and</i> <i class="calibre3">Celese  that  were mentioned  back  in Vol.3  aside from  Lotte). </i> The curly purplish hair Celese takes over at the counter. Falma tells the current part-time pharmacist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll prepare this medicine and give it to you. If you don’t see me, please wait.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, shopkeeper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Celese received the prescription in bulk and nodded heavily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I apologize for waiting for the medical candies. Please hand them out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, thank you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte careful y distributes the medical candy, and the patients do not complain for the long wait. Lotte mentions to Falma, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At the moment, your brother went upstairs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma decides that the infant may be infected and guides Palle with the infant to an isolation room in one of the doctor’s offices on the second floor. Falma, Palle, and Ellen follow into them and examine the infant. Falma discusses with Palle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s surprising that Palle picked up this abandoned child.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t leave this child alone. I may be a noble’s child, but I am likely to become a commoner without notice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle lays the infant on the bed, wraps the infant in a blanket, and looks down at her pitifully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah… the divine veins didn’t open. The parents were unhappy with the child.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen sympathizes for the infant. When a child of an aristocrat cannot use the divine power, the child cannot become a nobleman if the divine vein connection does not open.  Many  aristocrats  think  that  it  is  shameful  for  their  families  to  have  such  a worthless child and are willing to throw the child away among their children. This infant  happens  to be  one  of  the  disappointing  children,  abandoned  in  front  of  the temple, provided protection by the Great Church and will be taken to the orphanage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, since the temple of the Imperial Capital is too populated, the children are placed at the eaves of a suitable houses in some cases. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A noble child with an open divine vein can measure their divine power with a divine power meter. The gauge of the divine power meter does not work for children who don’t have their divine vein open. Ellen brings over a divine power meter to measure the infant just in case, but there are both good and bad news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No… if we want to save this child, we can hire the child as a servant later. This is also a saving grace. I don’t want to hand it over to the current temple.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen began to consider in taking her over to the Earl’s house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm… I mean, this kid seems to have divine power.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contrary to their views, Falma murmured to everyone. Falma can see a faint sparkle in the back of her body (the infant). He acknowledged that is an untouched source of divine power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, let’s begin the treatment now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma  prepares  clean  water  with  his  divine  art’s  creation,  cleanses  her  body  and changes her clothes. He recently developed a baby’s diaper and uses on the infant. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, that fits perfectly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The infant’s diarrhea has subsided for the time being because of severe dehydration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems that there is almost no water left in the body. If this happens, it is likely to result in serious infections. The infant isn’t crying or sweating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She  is vomiting, has whitish diarrhea and a slight fever,  so I think it’s a rotavirus infection.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle remarks based on the symptoms. Viral infection may cause excrement of bile color (brown) to disappear on stool. He is paying attention to it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you cure her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle asks Falma, and Falma suspects a probability that Palle is susceptible to infection due to a decrease in white blood cells during his chemotherapy. Palle brings back an infant, risks his life while knowing exactly his weakened physiological condition and recognizes the potential for infection with this virus. If Palle is infected, it can be life-threatening.  While  not  condoning  Palle’s,  Falma’s  patient,  behaviors,  Falma  didn’t want to waste Palle’s goodwill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Has  it  turned  white?”  <i class="calibre3">  (T/L  Note:  Palle  knows  Falma’s  Diagnostic  Eye  and  its</i> <i class="calibre3">functionalities as Falma treated him since Vol. 3)</i> Falma did not use the Diagnostic Eye at first, but now he is using it as he performs the follow-up diagnostic. Everyone wears protective vinyl capes, gloves and masks. Palle, who brought the baby, throws away everything he is wearing to prevent the spread of infection and Falma lends him the lab coat meant for the part-time job staff.  <i class="calibre3"> (T/L Note:</i> <i class="calibre3">If you haven’t noticed the talks between Elle and Palle during their magic match, you</i> <i class="calibre3">can sense the author is attempting to spark a relationship between them. Now, Palle’s</i> <i class="calibre3">buck naked. Hm… What is going through that vixen’s mind)</i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“White stool does not mean bile. I think it is biliary atresia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen  presents  another  possibility.  There  are  various  reasons  for  white  stool,  not necessarily because of virus infection. Falma smells the stool of the girl who was left in the scent.  <i class="calibre3">(T/L Note: Yep. SMELL IT! Ancient Chinese practices quite often, literally</i> <i class="calibre3">daily. The practice is skill continued today) </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ellen, smell it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen rolls her hand over the stool to capture the smell of the stool, even though she is frowning. Falma considers the risk of infection by air vector towards Palle tells him to refrain from joining in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It smells sour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When it smells fishy, there is the presence of bacteria in the diarrhea; when it smells sour, it is viral presence in the diarrhea. Then it’s Rota.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pal e is quite knowledgeable as he presents the result of the scent. Falma nods and says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right, there is a high possibility of rotavirus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma uses his Diagnostic Eye again. Since viruses are so small that they cannot be seen under a microscope like bacteria to determine a definitive diagnosis. It appears to be the suspected rotavirus infection. The infant’s whole body seems to be infected, but the light is concentrated along the digestive tract. The light seen through Falma’s eyes is magenta, which is almost red <i class="calibre3">. (T/L Note: red is bad as in it’s incurable). </i> The case is treatable, but it’s quite dangerous. Never al ow room for prejudice in any medical case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rotavirus infection was also referred to as pediatric pseudocholera. Even in modern Japan, the virus infects most infants, but in rare occasions where they become life threatening. The mortality rate is extremely low due to proper treatment with modern medical science. Falma reminises and freezes in a daze about the sweet old days in Japan with a painful distant gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In developed countries on Earth, it is rare to die from this disease. However, around the undeveloped countries of Earth, 40% of severe diarrhea up to the age of five is caused by the rotavirus, and the number of mortalities reaches 500,000 per year. It’s one of the top causes for infant mortality. Infections stemmed from this virus are the most severe as the symptoms are vomiting and severe diarrhea, in which this little female infant is exhibiting. This is an acute encephalitis and multiple-organ failures can also occur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And there is no silver bullet for rotavirus. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="chapter-007-oda-nobunaga-a">Chapter 007 – Oda Nobunaga [A]</h2>
<p>“E-err. Well, magic isn’t relevant in my training, so don’t worry about it and let’s proceed to swordsmanship training right away!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Yururu was being considerate. She was acting as if the magic aptitude test from earlier didn’t happen and proceeded to the swordsmanship training.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Pu, ahahahaha! She said that he only has non-elemental attributes! I thought that you were an interesting person during the entrance exam, but it turns out you’re just a mook!”</p>
<p>“…You’re being noisy.”</p>
<p>“…Bouran-san, you don’t have to say that much.”</p>
<p>Arthur and Tlue stopped Bouran’s laughter. Arthur did it because for some reason she hated what Bouran had said. As for Tlue, he was afraid of possible consequences. He thought it would be bad if Fay was offended.　</p>
<p>Also, Fay would spend his time with this unit from now on. Yururu thought that it would be bad if the relationship within the unit worsened because of such mischief.　</p>
<p>“Aah?! But what I said is a fact?!”　</p>
<p>“Y-you see, Bouran-san. Sensei also thinks that it’s not good to say such a thing, a-after all, we’ll be together from now on…”</p>
<p>“What’s with that? What’s wrong with saying the fact—”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Fay opened his mouth as Bouran was talking. He said it as if it had nothing to do with him, with an emotionless voice like a machine.　</p>
<p>“I don’t mind. What she said isn’t wrong anyway.”　</p>
<p>“…Ah?”</p>
<p>Fay reacted differently to what Bouran had expected, so she no longer looked down on him but instead looked at him as if he was a mysterious creature. Of course she would. She thought it was natural if people would get angry if they were made fun of.　</p>
<p>If a person was laughed at, they would feel uncomfortable and their emotions would fluctuate.</p>
<p>However, Fay showed nothing of it.　</p>
<p>“Let her say what she likes. After all… That’s indeed my<strong> current </strong>self.”　</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Bouran was at a loss of words at Fay’s statement. She closed her mouth and clicked her tongue as she looked away.　</p>
<p>“…Err, well, then let’s proceed to swordsmanship training.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>When Bouran went silent, Yururu was relieved and proceeded to resume her swordsmanship class. She gave each person a wooden sword from the five she had brought with her.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Let’s begin with a light swing! I’ve heard of your skills beforehand… Nevertheless, I wanted to see it for myself.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>With that said, Yururu turned to the four.　</p>
<p>“Let’s see… for now… let’s have everyone fight three times, one time against each person.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>They were given their first training. Indeed, they were part of a special unit, so she added, “I’ll say it first, but the person with the highest number of defeats would have to walk around the royal capital using their hand ten times after the training.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It was a unit that imposed a strange trial.　</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">◆◆</p>
<p>Damn it, now I have to walk around the capital upside down for ten laps… I did a handstand and went around the royal capital. I lost all the matches. <span id="easy-footnote-1-20062" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-20062" title=" T/N: Just to show how hard the training is. Kiro: How big is the capital? It could take days to do 10 laps on hands"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Well, they all sure were strong. Haah, they were indeed strong. For now at least? I’ll eventually grow stronger than them in the future. Well, I would have to give them some opportunity to show off, after all.　</p>
<p>Also, I was in the period where I was still weak. It was clear that I was the weakest person among them, with a big gap at that. There must be some meaning for me to be this weak right now.　</p>
<p>Even if you are a failure of a person, as long as you just train desperately… was something that was often said.　</p>
<p>Even so, the training was quite hard. Now that the swordsmanship sparring was done, we had to dash, dash, and dash like this. Having enough stamina should be important right? So now I dash, dash, and dash.　</p>
<p>That yuru-character sensei sure said something nasty despite her cute face. Also, it seemed that sensei’s class forbade the use <em>of art</em>. That was why everyone was running on the verge of dying.　</p>
<p>She said it was to strengthen one’s body and gain stamina. Although everyone was on the verge of dying, mine was especially worse. I will grow from now on, yes, from now on…　</p>
<p>Having to walk upside down was painful, but I was the protagonist. This should feel like a breeze. I would face a ridiculous enemy eventually after all.　</p>
<p>And one day…　</p>
<p>[“My efforts on that day paid off…”]　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It was obvious I would say such a thing. My arms were at their limits. I lost my balance many times and fell over. However, I would still continue. I wouldn’t make a compromise.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>I was the protagonist after all.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Once I completed the task, sensei suddenly came out of nowhere. It seemed that she had been watching me walk upside down all this time. It was something that commonly happened: a character watching over the protagonist.</p>
<p>It had come to this. She was probably the key person who would allow me to grow stronger.&nbsp; I would have her train me!　</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">◆◆</p>
<p><em>He is still doing it…</em></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Fay went around the royal capital on his hands. Yururu Garethia secretly followed him and looked at the situation.　</p>
<p>Even though it was right after doing that much training, he still continued on. The training within the special unit was much harder compared to other units.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Even though his swordsmanship, pure physical strength, and magical aptitude… is the worst compared to others in the group…</em>　</p>
<p>His movements were filled with weird habits and his stamina was decent, but it was clear that he was greatly inferior to others. He also had no aptitude for magic.　</p>
<p><em>Perhaps he is imposed with the greatest mental burden in the history of special units.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>There are three people who are better than him near him, and they clearly show a greater speed of growth as well. It would be very painful for Fay once that happened. It would be like this: by the time he makes his first step, the others are already on their tenth step. That is definitely…</em></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It was something that Yururu Garethia could greatly empathize with. She couldn’t make great progress no matter how desperately she trained, whether it was back then and even to this day.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>…I also did handstands a lot back then. I also went through this route.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She was laughed at, ridiculed, and treated like a clown. Even so, she continued working. Fay&#8217;s figure seemed to overlap with that of herself who was made a fool of back then.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>I heard that some people will slack off once they think that nobody is watching them… but he did it properly…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>He was still doing it even as he breathed heavily. Once he was done, he laid his arms on the training ground with three trees and breathed into his lungs over and over.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Great job you did there.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She naturally went to him and passed him a water bottle which was made of sheep’s stomach and filled with water.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Haa, haa… you saw it?”　</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I was just curious.”</p>
<p>“I see… thanks for the water…”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>He drank the water in the water bottle that Yururu gave him.　</p>
<p>“I’m sorry… I drank it all.”　</p>
<p>“No, that’s fine.”</p>
<p>“I see… do you still have time after this?”</p>
<p>“Eh? I-I do?”</p>
<p>“I see, in that case, train me with your sword.”</p>
<p>“…Eeh?! Bu- but, you already did so much today… you should be at your limit, right?”</p><div class="watas-9b110e7dd4cdd9966c5ff7e5ed31ab2a watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-9b110e7dd4cdd9966c5ff7e5ed31ab2a"></div>
<p>Yururu was so surprised that she made a loud voice. Of course she was. After all, he just did his training in addition to the punishment to do laps around the royal capital upside down.　</p>
<p>Even as she looked carefully at him, she saw that he had fallen over many times and his clothes and body were covered with dirt. She could feel that he was at his limit.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“There is no meaning… if I don’t exceed my limits.”　</p>
<p>“Fay-kun…”</p>
<p>“I’m the weakest among them… that’s why I want to grow stronger… more than anyone and anything.”</p>
<p>“…gh”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She was reminded of someone at that moment. It wasn’t the figure of her desperation, but someone scarier to her. It was someone she didn’t want to recall. In the dark abyss of memory, she felt she was familiar with the eyes he gazed at her with.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Nii-sama…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It was the figure of one of her brothers on his quest for power. He had cut off everything, including his own father, and proceeded into the darkness. She was reminded of her own brother, whom she thought she would never come to understand nor be able to meet again.　</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>“Fay-kun, you’re already at your limit. There are still lessons tomorrow… Although I happen to be responsible for them, it starts quite early. Let’s call it a day…”　</p>
<p>“I can only ask you for this… please.”</p>
<p>“…I understand, but we can’t take up so much time for this. After all, people who worry for you will&#8211;”</p>
<p>“I already told them I’ll be returning late today.”</p>
<p>“…Very well. Let’s start by explaining Fay-kun’s shortcomings. Simply put, you have a lot of weird habits and exert too much strength in your swings.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She bluntly said. Since somebody had requested for her tutelage, she wouldn’t refuse as an instructor.　</p>
<p>“You can’t fix all of your bad habits in a short timespan, so we’ll start with power control. Rather than having me just say it, it would be faster to let you experience it yourself. First, show me your dominant arm and raise it to shoulder level.”　</p>
<p>Fay raised his right arm as she instructed, putting it perpendicular to his shoulder.　</p>
<p>“Are you ready? Then, I’ll hit your arm using mine from above. Fay-kun is to maintain its current height and exert enough strength to ensure it is not lowered.”　</p>
<p>“Understood…”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Fay then exerted strength into his right arm. The blood vessels were slightly apparent as his muscles tightened.　</p>
<p>“Then I’ll do it, okay?”　</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>When Yururu hit his arm, it went down easily.　</p>
<p>“Next, we start with your arm in a relaxed state. I will hit your arm just like last time, but instead you have to brace for it just before my arm hits yours.”　</p>
<p>“Aah.”</p>
<p>Fay did as she told him to and relaxed his arm. Then, she raised her arm and lowered it in quick succession. Fay then stiffened his arm at the moment of impact.　</p>
<p>This time, his arm didn’t go down. It had properly received the force from above.　</p>
<p>“…See? It won’t go down, right? That’s how it works. It’s not that you exert strength all the time; you have to exert it only at the moment when your sword hits others&#8217; and grip it tightly. The force it produces then will be much greater.”　</p>
<p>“…That seems to be the case.”</p>
<p>“Well then, pay close attention to that. As for your weird habits… uh, we can only work them out gradually by finding your most optimal movements through actual combat experience, so we can’t fix them right away.”</p>
<p>“…How long will it take?”</p>
<p>“I think it’ll take a long time…”</p>
<p>“…Do you have time to spare in the mornings?”</p>
<p>“…You want to train in the morning as well? I think that’ll tire you to death though?”</p>
<p>“That’s what I want.”</p>
<p>“That’s what you want, is it…?”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She lowered her gaze and made a sad expression. But she soon raised her head and handed him the iron sword she had on her.　</p>
<p>“…Well, I guess that’s alright. I have no reason to refuse anyway… I’ll be strict with you then, Fay-kun!”　</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Then the night went on.　</p>
<p>And Fay, who returned very late, was greeted by a furious Maria.　</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">■◆</p>
<p>The next day, a room for five was rented for the lecture. Yururu stood in front and the other four sat down in front of her. Desks were prepared for each of them, making it feel much like a classroom.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Well then, everyone. Today I will be explaining about Abyss, which is considered the most dangerous enemy that a paladin has to face. They are mainly active during the evenings and at night.” 　</p>
<p>“Sensei&#8211;”</p>
<p>“Yes, Bouran-san?”</p>
<p>“Why are they not active in the morning?”</p>
<p>“Well, the ancient monster known as the Oumagadogi (Disaster of Ouma) was sealed by Arthur (The Origin Hero). It is said that  Abyss monsters are a derivative existence of the Oumagadogi.”<span id="easy-footnote-1-20066" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-20066" title="T/N: Kinda late, but kanji for Abyss is demonic abyss creature, while the Oumagadogi is written as disaster of demonic abyss in kanji."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p>“Fu-hn.”</p>
<p>Bouran gave a short reply to the instructor. Then, as Tlue and Fay listened quietly, Arthur’s face darkened a little.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“It is said that this Oumagadogi was originally a human paladin. It was just that, due to various illegal experimentations and crimes said paladin did, their body was torched. As a result, they suffered a severe burn which made it painful for them to be exposed to the sun. That is why they are basically only active when the sun is down.”　</p>
<p>“Heeh… I knew that anecdote about Arthur though.”</p>
<p>“It is theorized that they inherited the traits, habits, and memories of their time as a human, which affected what they became.”</p>
<p>“Fu-hn… speaking of which, Arthur happens to have the same name as the hero. Are you related somehow?”</p>
<p>“…I’m not.”</p>
<p>“But see, your parents sure gave you such a grand name.”</p>
<p>“…Shut up.”</p>
<p>“…What’s with that, I don’t think it&#8217;s something to be angry about?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Bouran-san, calm down. Arthur-san doesn’t seem to want to talk about it.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Arthur was immediately in a sour mood. Her words sounded forceful despite usually lacking feelings behind them. Tlue, who sensed that something was wrong, proceeded to mediate between the two.　</p>
<p>Yururu panicked and felt that the atmosphere in the room was getting heavier.</p>
<p>“I don’t care about that… just continue with the story.”　</p>
<p>Among them, Fay was the only one who urged Yururu to continue the story. It was as if he didn’t give a damn about the current situation.　</p>
<p>“Eh, ah- y-you’re right.”　</p>
<p>“Also, Bouran.”</p>
<p>“Ah?”</p>
<p>“Don’t make such a fuss over a name. You’re not a kid after all. Even if you get tied up with something like that, you gain nothing. Perhaps you find it funny, but that’s just dull.”</p>
<p>“…gh.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>He silently looked back to the front, with Arthur staring at his figure. After the lecture, the five people left the room. Their next activity was swordsmanship training, which Yururu was also in-change of just like yesterday.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>As Fay immediately headed over, Arthur walked next to him.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Thank you, for earlier…”　</p>
<p>“…I’m not sure what you are talking about.”</p>
<p>“That thing about names…”</p>
<p>“Aah, you mean that. Don’t get me wrong, I only did that for my own sake.”</p>
<p>“I see… Isn’t Fay curious about my name?”</p>
<p>“I don’t care. I’m not interested. I’ll just walk down my own path.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Fay said that with his usual expressionless face. However, Arthur, who walked next to him, didn’t have her usual expressionless face but was instead a beautiful girl laughing lightly.　</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">■◆</p>
<p>Well, I didn’t care about names. You see, I hated people who made a fuss just because a person&#8217;s name happened to be similar to a historical person&#8217;s. During my highschool years, Oda-kun, who sat next to me, was often teased for it.<span id="easy-footnote-2-20066" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-20066" title=" T/N: The “O”da of this oda-kun has a different kanji from “O”da of oda nobunaga."><sup>2</sup></a></span>　</p>
<p>[“Today’s class is about Oda Nobunaga.”]　</p>
<p>[“Huh? Speaking of which, isn’t your surname Oda too?! (Comes a male high school student trying to make a joke out of it to gather the girls&#8217; attentions.)”]</p>
<p>[“Today’s class is about Imagawa Yoshimoto.”]　</p>
<p>[“Huh? Speaking of which, isn’t your surname (Omitted) too?”]</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been my greatest pet peeve even in my previous life. I didn’t find anything interesting about it since it was a cold joke to me. I was always taking my classes seriously, but everyone had to stop for a moment just to respond to that lame joke, so I wished they didn’t do it.　</p><div class="watas-df7e5498e56dbef465d9a9b57167fdc1 watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-df7e5498e56dbef465d9a9b57167fdc1"></div>
<p>Bouran, you aren’t a kid, right? Nah, you still feel like a kid in some ways, I guess. She felt like a person who was never taught about such a thing and lived unknowing all this time.　</p>
<p>Well, I guess Arthur, whose name happened to be the same as the historical figure in this world, might be a hint of some sort, but I didn’t care about that. I hated this kind of thing. There was simply no meaning to it.　</p>
<p>I guess Arthur also has it hard, having the same name as a historical figure. Perhaps she often suffered from the name jokes like the Oda Nobunaga stuff I had in my world.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“That thing about names…”</p>
<p>“Aah, you mean that.”　</p>
<p>As expected, even Arthur was pissed about it. To think that Arthur, whose words were often filled with sarcasm, actually thanked me for that.　</p>
<p>Well, a name was important, I wouldn’t deny that. Although I didn’t know who Arthur’s parents were, perhaps they had the consideration to name their child the same as the hero for a reason. However, I wasn’t bored enough to give a damn about it.　</p>
<p>“I see… Isn’t Fay curious about my name?”</p>
<p>“I don’t care. I’m not interested. I’ll just walk down my own path.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know who the great person named Arthur was in this world to begin with. I didn’t read books, and only spent my time training after all.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Well then, I will switch my train of thought and head for swordsmanship training. I already felt tired since I had strict training in the morning though.　</p>
