<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Future Objectives</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we were back at the dungeon entrance, I let Maguro and the carriage out of the subspace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, let&#8217;s get going. Can you guys help me with the preparation?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure, but&#8230;why not just teleport us all directly to Perdis?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo asked me, wondering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, sure I could. But then again, we are not particularly in a hurry, so I thought maybe we’d just take our time traveling back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haha, you&#8217;re right. It would be nice to take it easy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now you get it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I laughed as I fed Maguro and petted it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Maguro had finished eating, we boarded the carriage and set off for the royal capital of Perdis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the number of people accompanying us had increased, there was no problem at all because my carriage was equipped with a door that led to the subspace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, our leisurely journey began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’ll take a little over a week from here to the royal capital of Perdis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s nothing else to do on the way, so I&#8217;ll take it slow while making sure everyone keep up with their training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ll have to be careful not to neglect my equipment and training, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the question is what to do after we get to Perdis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ll need to look into the magic circle for our return back home, but I can&#8217;t spend all my time on just that as well.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-15357176' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-15357176' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSc5JyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8IS0tIEJsb2NrIDkuMSAtIERpc3BsYXkgQWZ0ZXIgcGFyYWdyYXBoIDAuMSAtLT4KPGlucyBjbGFzcz0iYWRzYnlnb29nbGUiCiAgICAgc3R5bGU9ImRpc3BsYXk6YmxvY2siCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1jbGllbnQ9ImNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtc2xvdD0iNjQ2MDkxNjYyMyIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWZvcm1hdD0iYXV0byI+PC9pbnM+CjxzY3JpcHQ+CiAgICAgKGFkc2J5Z29vZ2xlID0gd2luZG93LmFkc2J5Z29vZ2xlIHx8IFtdKS5wdXNoKHt9KTsKPC9zY3JpcHQ+' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what should I do&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked Tendo and the others, they said they were going to look for knights and strong adventurers in Perdis to train with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve learned from this battle that we&#8217;re still not strong enough. We need to become stronger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I’m glad that they’re overflowing with motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m sure they’ll become strong enough to defeat the Demon King in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Great, I&#8217;m looking forward to it. In the meantime, you&#8217;re welcome to use my mansion as your base.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, that would be very helpful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s no use having such a large mansion if it’s not being used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm, so I guess we&#8217;ll be acting separately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accompanying them in that endeavor kinda feels wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Tendo and the others are trying to become stronger in their own way, it would be better not to interfere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps&#8230;I think it would be interesting to try to create a trading company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quality of the potions, weapons, and magic tools I make is high if I do say so myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more importantly, if I develop products based on ideas from my original world, I can imagine them dominating the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is manpower&#8230;but I could just use slaves for this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using slaves, not with bad intentions obviously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve never had a good impression of slavery, but like in the case of Ephyr, I can help those who are unfortunate and doomed by buying them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I would like to do the same thing this time, buy people who have become slaves for unjust reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like to be able to treat them in a civilized manner, pay them wages, and allow them the opportunity to buy themselves out when they save up enough money.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They could also choose to remain as employees if they wished, in this way, I will have no need to worry about shortage of staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, criminal slaves are a no no.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I proceeded to tell everyone about the idea as soon as I could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow, I think it&#8217;s a very good idea, Haruto!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Exactly. I think it&#8217;s great that you can save people who are in the same situation I was.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, when I heard slaves, I was a little taken aback, but I think it&#8217;s a great idea.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s right! “We&#8217;ll help you with the product development as well, if that&#8217;s okay with you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Said, Finne, Ephyr, Tendo and Asakura.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The others seemed to be of the same opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you all, I&#8217;m glad you approve.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, we continued our journey, talking about the store, training, all while taking it easy, and arrived back in the Kingdom of Perdis within a week as planned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I arrived at the capital, the first thing I did was to go to the royal castle to meet with King Dillan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would have been fine to go back to the mansion, but I wanted to give him another report on what happened in Glicente and discuss the establishment of a trading company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we approached the castle, we got off the carriage and were walking towards it when the gatekeeper spotted Iris and me and called out to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess, Master Haruto, and even the hero.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, I am acquainted with this gatekeeper, Thomas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I visited the castle many times, we got to know each other well enough to make small talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mr. Thomas, is Dillan around right now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His Majesty should be in the castle today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, may we come in?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course you may.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Thomas opened the gate for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we went through the gate, we were not met by the usual guiding soldiers, but by Zebastian, sir Dillan&#8217;s butler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s been a while, Lady Iris, Master Haruto. This way, please. His Majesty is waiting for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;How did you know we were coming back?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We received a report that you had entered the capital. After that, I felt your presence approaching, so I came up to greet you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Makes sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His older brother, Sebastian, who now works as a butler in my mansion, is pretty strong, close to level 100&#8230;and the younger brother, Zebas, is not bad himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We started walking with Zebastian leading the way, and soon we arrived at the guest room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s Zebas. I’ve brought Lady Iris, Master Haruto and the heroes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Zebastian called out, sir Dillan’s voice came from the other side of the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside were Sir Dillan and Lady Amalia, the queen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s been a while. Iris and Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re back, Mom, Dad!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, I&#8217;m also glad to see that both Sir Dillan and Lady Amalia are doing well.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-91531809' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-91531809' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief greeting, I decided to introduce my new companions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sir Dillan, this is my new companion, Kusel.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel got down on one knee and gave her greetings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My name is Kusel, I used to be the deputy knight captain of the Glicente Kingdom. I&#8217;m currently working with Haruto as an adventurer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. I&#8217;ve heard about you from Haruto. Please take care of him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan said to Kusel gently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And—&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero stepped forward in response to my words.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am ‘Gran Kalamiras, The Smelting Dragon’, ruler of the Nargadia Labyrinth. I have been given a new name by Master Haruto, and now go by ‘Zero Kalamiras, The Smelting Dragon’. Pleased to make your acquaintance. Human king.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected of Zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when introducing himself to the king, he crossed his arms and kept his arrogant attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Well, saying “pleased to make your acquaintance” was probably his own way of showing courtesy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Dillan didn&#8217;t say anything about it, rather his mouth was kinda frozen in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, by Smelting Dragon Gran Kalamiras, you don’t mean&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm? What do you know about Zero, Dillan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s the name of a dragon from the age of the gods! I believe he’s well known as the primordial dragon, the dragon progenitor that made even the gods tremble with fear. Although his existence hadn’t been confirmed, he is considered to be a calamity class disaster&#8230;I&#8217;ve heard rumors of a dragon sleeping at the lowest floor of the Nargadia labyrinth, but I never thought it would be the Smelting Dragon Gran Kalamiras!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, is that so&#8230;anyway, on a different note, I&#8217;m creating a trading company.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh really, you are—hey, don&#8217;t you change the subject! That’s a calamity class disaster standing in front of me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan shouted like he just blew a gasket, which made me wonder if it was really something worth making such a fuss about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wouldn’t worry about that, since he’s already under my command.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right. Moreover, there is also Behemoth whom you summoned, and currently under your command as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Iris said nonchalantly following my words, Dillan’s eyes widened as if they were going to pop out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;What? Behemoth? Iris, you mean the one from the folklore and fairy tales?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right! Amazing right! Haruto is so cool!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh, yeah, sure. Amazing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan was not sure how to respond, but he said something like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lady Amalia, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t seem to be fazed as she kept smiling and simply said, &#8220;Oh my”. In a way, she might be the most amazing person in the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan was stunned for a while, but then he shook his head and looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahem! So? You want to establish a trading company?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean, money is no object, so I just thought it would be fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see&#8230;meaning, this is why you came here today?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. I came to report my return and to ask for the requirements to establish the trading company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan’s face became serious as I answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see.  Specifically, how far have you gone in preparations?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well&#8230;the merchandise is pretty much decided. I&#8217;m planning to use slaves as employees, as for a good spot, that’s the challenge I’m currently facing, so I will appreciate some recommendations. Also, if I could get the necessary permit for setting up the trading company, that would be great too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan placed his hand on his chin and asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm, slaves&#8230;how are you going to treat them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m going to pay them fair wages, and adopt a policy where they can buy their freedom once they’ve saved up enough. Of course, if they wish, they could remain as employees&#8230;some of them may have been enslaved for unjust reasons, and I&#8217;m hoping that this could also save them.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan was pondering while Lady Amalia next to him expressed her approval by saying “oh my, that’s quite good”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well&#8230;since it’s Haruto, I don’t have to worry about you buying up criminal slaves. All right, I&#8217;ll allow the establishment of your trading company. Do you have a particular location in mind?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s see&#8230;I&#8217;d like to avoid the aristocrat district because some goods will be available to the general public. However, I do want to sell goods aimed at the nobles as well, so I would like to find a place where both nobles and commoners can easily visit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll look for a place with those conditions. Do you have a budget in mind?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“None, I&#8217;ll leave the decision to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan nodded his head and turned to Zebastian.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand. I&#8217;ll get working on it right away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zebastian, who understood his intention from just that, bowed and left the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now you just need to register the trading company. I&#8217;ll take care of that, meanwhile, Haruto will serve as the representative, correct?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “That would do for now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan looked at me curiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. It’s possible I&#8217;ll get someone else to serve as the representative later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right. Finally, what&#8217;s the name of your trading company?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Name&#8230;I hadn&#8217;t decided yet. What should I do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmmm, yet another naming task&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing my reaction, Dillan took advantage flippantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmmm, my official duties for the day are over and now, I have some private time. Let me also help you pick out a name.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks&#8230;all right then, can each of you come up with a potential name for the trading company?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in the room started to think of a name for the trading company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How about the Perdis Trading Company?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan suggested&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wouldn&#8217;t it be difficult to open a store in another country with that name? Also, people might think it&#8217;s a state-run chamber of commerce.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I dismissed the idea, Amalia clapped her hands as if to say, I&#8217;ve got a good idea!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then how about Haruto Trading Company?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;That&#8217;s a little embarrassing, so I&#8217;m going to dismiss it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is usually embarrassing to have your own name as a chamber of commerce. If it is Yuki Trading Company, it might be worth considering&#8230;nah, I better dismiss it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, a number of potential names came up, but none of them seemed to fit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you get into such whirlpool of thoughts, it’s damn near impossible to get out of it&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chamber of commerce, store, business, enterprise&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, I&#8217;ve got a good one!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;How about Ashtaroth Trading Company?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ashtaroth&#8230;what does that mean again? Some kind of deity I believe?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asakura reacted to my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yes, that&#8217;s right. I don&#8217;t remember which deity it is exactly, but I thought it sounded good.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo chuckled when he heard my random reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wow, that’s just so typical of you, Haruto. But it sounds good, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll take that as a compliment, though it does bother me that it&#8217;s so typical of me&#8230;so, what do you guys think?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-15156582' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-15156582' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked, and they all nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sounds good to me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah. I think it&#8217;s a good name!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, Finne, and everyone else seemed to be in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, it’s settled&#8230;Dillan, how soon do you think we can get a good location? I&#8217;m thinking of going to the slave traders tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let me see&#8230;I think it&#8217;ll take about three days.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, I&#8217;ll be counting on you then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, while we were talking about what had happened at Glicente and other trivial matters, I realized that the sun had completely set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to go back to the mansion, so I thanked Dillan and Amalia and left the royal castle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mansion I hadn&#8217;t seen in a long time hadn&#8217;t changed at all from before&#8230;no wait, the whole place seemed to have been cleaned up?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““Welcome back, Master Haruto.”””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I opened the front door and walked in to be greeted by Sebastian, the butler, and the maids Lyla and Mia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Long time no see, Sebastian. I went to the castle and found your brother in good health. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve seen Lyla and Mia too. Thank you all for taking care of the mansion while I was gone. I really appreciate it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Those words are more than we deserve.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three bowed their heads in reverence and humility, but it must have been difficult to keep a house of this size tidy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh right, I&#8217;d like to introduce you three to our newest members.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I urged Kusel and Zero to come forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m Kusel, former Deputy Knight Captain of the Kingdom of Glicente. I&#8217;m now an adventurer. Nice to meet you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas and the others reacted slightly to the word Glicente, but quickly bowed their heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m Zero, under my lord’s command. Pleasure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when Zero greeted them, they froze for a moment, but quickly returned to their composure and bowed their heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right, I should have known anyone as good as these three, should realize how strong Zero is&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I guess I can explain to them about Zero at dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, after sorting out our luggage, we had dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We talked about what we&#8217;ve been up to since we left, and enjoyed the reaction of Sebas and the others when they found out about Zero&#8217;s true identity. When dinner was over, I explained to Sebastian about my intention to start a trading company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—So, that’s the plan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, that sounds interesting. But what about the employees&#8217; quarters?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebastian asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My initial thoughts were, since we’ll be starting with just a few, they could stay here, but when the number increases, there won’t be nearly enough rooms. So, I think it&#8217;s best to secure lodgings as soon as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand. I&#8217;ll start looking for good potential lodgings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the business becomes profitable and sustainable, it can serve as the financier to cultivate my classmates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, they should have just about cleared the Nargadia labyrinth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope they will at least grow strong enough to defeat the Demon King&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we talked about this, the night was drawing to a close.</span></p>
