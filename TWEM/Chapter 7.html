<h3>Chapter 7: Rotavirus Infection and Abandoned Child</h3>


<p class="calibre1">The Empress’s cane is thrown into the clear sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Violent  Flame!”  <i class="calibre3">(T/L  Note:  Flame  Violations  is  a  poor  substitute  for  an  aggressive</i> <i class="calibre3">command from the wild Empress with Les violations de la flamme)</i> The moment the cast is made, the  <i class="calibre3">place (T/L Note: the plain near the Imperial City of</i> <i class="calibre3">San Flueve as no one is foolish enough to invoke an inferno around forests/hillsides with</i> <i class="calibre3">wildlife)</i> becomes a sea of fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whirlwind of a large flame scorches the wilderness on the outskirts of the Imperial City, and burns down a vast area at glance. Some of those who witnessed the event feel suffocated by the large consumption of oxygen by the blaze. Since the blaze travels downwind, the caster is not wrapped in smoke; however, if humans are caught with that violent flame, not even bones or shadows would remain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is terrible. The land of such a vast area turned into scorched soil in a short time…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon, who became the Empress’s theological adviser, witnesses the sight of the lifeless land that was swifted away. The massive flame was violent enough to burn the clothes that he wore even when he casted a water Art User’s elemental ice barrier around him for protection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the Empress casted a flame inferno, there will be no living plants left to be seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are small amounts of lingering divine power that ponded on the ground. The Empress is unquestionably the current strongest god among the gods in the world beside Falma, who is currently possessed by Medicine God, amongst human beings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, I’m exhausted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Empress, exposed directly to the hot air of the inferno, sweats slightly on her forehead, drinks water in satisfaction, unties her hair, and puts on her jacket back on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  new  Empress’s  aid,  Salomon,  takes  a  sigh  of  admiration  at  the  beautiful  and impressive divine technique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her power has not declined at all while in office. Who dares to turn against the Empire, or  takes  on  the  Empress  alone  as  enemies?  At  the  time  when  the  war  begins,  the country  will  sink  into  a  sea  of  fire.  That  terrifying  divine  technique  for  the  sea  of inferno has been further refined and magnified in power by the guidance of Salomon in detail. Of course, this test at the outskirts of the Empire is not a bloody battlefield… </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you Your Majesty, the Empire’s Empress, for invoking the wildfire!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This will produce good grass in the near future. Cattle will be happy if they have young shoots!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rancher is quite impressed to see the great divine technique up close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um, keep cows away so they don’t inhale the smoke.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is an annual event for the Empress to burn the grazing fields under the Empire’s management once a year. The Empress’s divine art training that can use ultra-wide flame divine art is limited to the desert, sea, and grazing field. This divine art is too powerful for her to use during peacetime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is the range of ability of Your Majesty’s current divine skill?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon asks. She observes the gauge on her cane, which has a meter that measures </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">double rating of the common divine power meter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It seems to be at 70%. It was a good exercise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Solomon smiled wryly. She appears like an innocent girl. Solomon continues to ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By the way, how much power does Falma have? He doesn’t wants to give up training for Falma. He’s not a blunt person to declare his intention.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the case of Falma, if he uses even 1%, the empire will be destroyed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon sighs as he thinks it requires daily training in the divine art is necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why do you want to understand the power of Falma?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By comparing, one can gauge his power with the power of successive guardian deities in the scriptures.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Empress’s eyes, Salomon is quite clever to bring up the idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If that is the case, I wonder if there is remaining power for other sacred nations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma stated that he would go back to the Great Shrine at the Holy City and the Empress has  initiated  her  first  move  to  notify  the  Great  Shrine.  She  mentions  to  Solomon Falma’s purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It seems that he desires to return the treasure wand of the Great Church. However, Falma is a dignitary of the Empire and my chief pharmacist, so I’m not going to send him  to  the  Holy  City.  If  he  needs  to  return  it,  send  it  with  a  messenger.  If  Falma disappears from the Empire without notice  <i class="calibre3">(T/L Note: kidnapped)</i> and harm is done to Falma, I will declare war on the Holy City on the same day. Since there is no one who can detain Falma other than the Holy City, it can be regarded as the work of the Holy City without further evidence. If there is a need to meet with Falma, have them meet him in my presence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since Falma has been targeted, the Holy City must gain consent from the Empire. A reply came back indicating that it is not necessary to return the holy treasure wand while the Empress has Falma in her custody as her primary pharmacist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma  is  surprised  when  the  Empress  reports  the  letter  to  Falma.  The  Empress’s </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">authority shuts down the Great Church of the Holy City. Falma cannot lose Salomon and desires Solomon’s safety. In this regard, the Empress wonders how the history book will be adjusted later. The Great Church cuts all communication with Falma. The Empress has her aides search for clues to the Holy Spring as Falma can no longer ask the Great Church for information. However, Falma mentions that that the priests of the Imperial Capital’s local church come often to the Different World Pharmacy to buy medicines… </p>
<p class="calibre1">The current date is April of 1147. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of Palle’s leukemia chemotherapies, additional consultations by Falma to prevent a relapse and the result is favorable. Palle also visits Bruno’s (his father) place on good days. Little by little, he begins to take over as the chief pharmacist for Bruno’s and  Falma’s  patients.  Bruno  wants  to  immerse  himself  in  running  the  San  Fleuve Imperial School of Pharmacology University, and Falma has to deal with the Different World Pharmacy along with other things. So Pal e has been deemed as the best successor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle is quite skilled, his knowledge and communication are good, and his reputation is not worse than that of Bruno. In addition, he begins to accumulate favorable results by treating patients who could not be cured by Bruno’s diagnosis and treatments by using new drugs from Falma.Palle often appears at Falma’s pharmacy mainly to stock up on new medicine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think the patient has this kind of illness, but I want to use this medicine instead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And this is how it goes between Falma and Palle. Falma confirms the symptoms and various observable test results provided by Palle, and if Falma believes the diagnostic is correct, Falma hands over the medicine. Palle uses the camera to provide the photos, which are very helpful in explaining the conditions of the patient. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, Falma directly goes to the patient after informing Palle. Palle is still two years behind Falma in becoming the first-class pharmacist, but he has begun to practice first-class pharmacist training with patients. Palle’s life is quite fulfilling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle comes to Falma’s pharmacy one afternoon and enters through the backdoor with an  unusual  action.  He  normally  comes  through  the  front  door,  but  it  seems  that something is wrong. He whispers to the pharmacy’s staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is Falma around?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s wrong with that child? Is that Palle’s secret child?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">El en asks Pal e as she stares at the infant who appears to be a few months old in Palle’s arm. However, the baby did not cry energetically like a common child, and seems to be feeble. Furthermore, the infant’s face and hair are full of grime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The child may be abandoned and dehydrated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Palle examines by pricking the facial area of the infant, vomit is seen around the mouth. There is no tension on the skin, and the area around the eyes is depressed. As Palle lightly pinches the skin on the back of the baby’s hand, the skin does not return to its original elasticity and remains in a chevron shape. This is one way to detect signs of dehydration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The infant’s breath is light and low heart beats. In the meanwhile, Falma prescribes all the prescriptions for the patients who are rushing to the pharmacy and hands the prescriptions to the part-time pharmacists  <i class="calibre3">(T/L Notes: probably Roger, Rebecca, and</i> <i class="calibre3">Celese  that  were mentioned  back  in Vol.3  aside from  Lotte). </i> The curly purplish hair Celese takes over at the counter. Falma tells the current part-time pharmacist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll prepare this medicine and give it to you. If you don’t see me, please wait.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, shopkeeper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Celese received the prescription in bulk and nodded heavily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I apologize for waiting for the medical candies. Please hand them out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, thank you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte careful y distributes the medical candy, and the patients do not complain for the long wait. Lotte mentions to Falma, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At the moment, your brother went upstairs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma decides that the infant may be infected and guides Palle with the infant to an isolation room in one of the doctor’s offices on the second floor. Falma, Palle, and Ellen follow into them and examine the infant. Falma discusses with Palle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s surprising that Palle picked up this abandoned child.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t leave this child alone. I may be a noble’s child, but I am likely to become a commoner without notice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle lays the infant on the bed, wraps the infant in a blanket, and looks down at her pitifully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah… the divine veins didn’t open. The parents were unhappy with the child.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen sympathizes for the infant. When a child of an aristocrat cannot use the divine power, the child cannot become a nobleman if the divine vein connection does not open.  Many  aristocrats  think  that  it  is  shameful  for  their  families  to  have  such  a worthless child and are willing to throw the child away among their children. This infant  happens  to be  one  of  the  disappointing  children,  abandoned  in  front  of  the temple, provided protection by the Great Church and will be taken to the orphanage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, since the temple of the Imperial Capital is too populated, the children are placed at the eaves of a suitable houses in some cases. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A noble child with an open divine vein can measure their divine power with a divine power meter. The gauge of the divine power meter does not work for children who don’t have their divine vein open. Ellen brings over a divine power meter to measure the infant just in case, but there are both good and bad news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No… if we want to save this child, we can hire the child as a servant later. This is also a saving grace. I don’t want to hand it over to the current temple.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen began to consider in taking her over to the Earl’s house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm… I mean, this kid seems to have divine power.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contrary to their views, Falma murmured to everyone. Falma can see a faint sparkle in the back of her body (the infant). He acknowledged that is an untouched source of divine power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, let’s begin the treatment now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma  prepares  clean  water  with  his  divine  art’s  creation,  cleanses  her  body  and changes her clothes. He recently developed a baby’s diaper and uses on the infant. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, that fits perfectly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The infant’s diarrhea has subsided for the time being because of severe dehydration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems that there is almost no water left in the body. If this happens, it is likely to result in serious infections. The infant isn’t crying or sweating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She  is vomiting, has whitish diarrhea and a slight fever,  so I think it’s a rotavirus infection.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle remarks based on the symptoms. Viral infection may cause excrement of bile color (brown) to disappear on stool. He is paying attention to it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you cure her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle asks Falma, and Falma suspects a probability that Palle is susceptible to infection due to a decrease in white blood cells during his chemotherapy. Palle brings back an infant, risks his life while knowing exactly his weakened physiological condition and recognizes the potential for infection with this virus. If Palle is infected, it can be life-threatening.  While  not  condoning  Palle’s,  Falma’s  patient,  behaviors,  Falma  didn’t want to waste Palle’s goodwill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Has  it  turned  white?”  <i class="calibre3">  (T/L  Note:  Palle  knows  Falma’s  Diagnostic  Eye  and  its</i> <i class="calibre3">functionalities as Falma treated him since Vol. 3)</i> Falma did not use the Diagnostic Eye at first, but now he is using it as he performs the follow-up diagnostic. Everyone wears protective vinyl capes, gloves and masks. Palle, who brought the baby, throws away everything he is wearing to prevent the spread of infection and Falma lends him the lab coat meant for the part-time job staff.  <i class="calibre3"> (T/L Note:</i> <i class="calibre3">If you haven’t noticed the talks between Elle and Palle during their magic match, you</i> <i class="calibre3">can sense the author is attempting to spark a relationship between them. Now, Palle’s</i> <i class="calibre3">buck naked. Hm… What is going through that vixen’s mind)</i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“White stool does not mean bile. I think it is biliary atresia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen  presents  another  possibility.  There  are  various  reasons  for  white  stool,  not necessarily because of virus infection. Falma smells the stool of the girl who was left in the scent.  <i class="calibre3">(T/L Note: Yep. SMELL IT! Ancient Chinese practices quite often, literally</i> <i class="calibre3">daily. The practice is skill continued today) </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ellen, smell it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen rolls her hand over the stool to capture the smell of the stool, even though she is frowning. Falma considers the risk of infection by air vector towards Palle tells him to refrain from joining in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It smells sour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When it smells fishy, there is the presence of bacteria in the diarrhea; when it smells sour, it is viral presence in the diarrhea. Then it’s Rota.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pal e is quite knowledgeable as he presents the result of the scent. Falma nods and says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right, there is a high possibility of rotavirus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma uses his Diagnostic Eye again. Since viruses are so small that they cannot be seen under a microscope like bacteria to determine a definitive diagnosis. It appears to be the suspected rotavirus infection. The infant’s whole body seems to be infected, but the light is concentrated along the digestive tract. The light seen through Falma’s eyes is magenta, which is almost red <i class="calibre3">. (T/L Note: red is bad as in it’s incurable). </i> The case is treatable, but it’s quite dangerous. Never al ow room for prejudice in any medical case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rotavirus infection was also referred to as pediatric pseudocholera. Even in modern Japan, the virus infects most infants, but in rare occasions where they become life threatening. The mortality rate is extremely low due to proper treatment with modern medical science. Falma reminises and freezes in a daze about the sweet old days in Japan with a painful distant gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In developed countries on Earth, it is rare to die from this disease. However, around the undeveloped countries of Earth, 40% of severe diarrhea up to the age of five is caused by the rotavirus, and the number of mortalities reaches 500,000 per year. It’s one of the top causes for infant mortality. Infections stemmed from this virus are the most severe as the symptoms are vomiting and severe diarrhea, in which this little female infant is exhibiting. This is an acute encephalitis and multiple-organ failures can also occur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And there is no silver bullet for rotavirus. </p>
