<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; The Heroes’ Labyrinth Raid 2</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What lay beyond the door was a vast sky and endless land.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until now, the interior was typical of a dungeon, with rocky surfaces and bricks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even though it was on the lowest floor, Tendo and his party couldn&#8217;t hide their confusion at the sight of the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What, in the world&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo muttered, but no one could answer him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he looked around, Asakura noticed a presence in the distance and pointed with her finger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;L-Look&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What they saw, was a huge jet-black dragon about 200 meters long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as the dragon, which had an ominous aura about it, noticed the presence of Tendo and his party, it slowly stood up and roared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—Guruaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others who had endured the roars of the Minotaur and Chimera almost ran away as quickly as they could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They instinctively realized that they stood no chance of winning. But even so, Tendo used appraisal on the dragon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you, kidding me&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-39495490' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-39495490' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everyone, try using appraisal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prompted by Tendo, Mogami and the others who immediately tried using appraisal turned pale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dragon&#8217;s level was&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;L-Level 300, is this, some kind of joke&#8230;..?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo muttered in dismay as his body trembled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the party was stunned by its ridiculously overpowered status, the dragon opened its mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—!? Spread out!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, a fireball landed on the spot where they had been standing and exploded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the place where the flames had settled, the ground was melting into mush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cold sweat broke out on the foreheads of the party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—Guruaaaahhhh!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dragon roared, and as Tendo and the others readied their weapons, a voice echoed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘—To be able to avoid my attack. Who are you lot?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment, Tendo wondered whose voice it was, but then he quickly realized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It belonged to the dragon in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had assumed that there was no such thing as a monster that could understand human language, but he figured he could talk to it, so he answered the dragon&#8217;s question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are heroes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Heroes, huh? I see. That explains why you were able to make it this far.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;If I may ask you something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘You&#8217;re all going to die here anyway. So, ask away.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is a dragon of your caliber, doing in this place?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dragon in front of them—Kalamiras, is of a level far too high for this dungeon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras answered the ever so legitimate question without seeming to care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Oh that—’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to his story, it started several thousand years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras used to live in this land, but his surroundings turned into a dungeon in response to his magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a long time, he decided to observe the dungeon and created a space at the lowest level, moved there, and lived by blocking out magic power and information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even so, the effects of his presence could not be suppressed, and the monsters in the lower floors became unusually strong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Tendo and the others were the first to arrive here&#8230;that was the story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I am the ruler of this labyrinth. If you want to conquer it, defeat me. That is, if you have the ability to do so.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others distorted their faces at Kalamiras&#8217; words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At their level, it would be impossible for them to defeat Kalamiras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo wanted to negotiate a way to avoid a fight, but Kalamiras told them before he could say anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Now that you know about this place, I can&#8217;t let you leave. Either you defeat me or I claim your heads, it’s one or the other.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo&#8217;s stomach churned and then he turned around to look at his friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everything’s going to be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn right!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m a little nervous, though&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo asked Ichinomiya, Mogami, Asakura, and Shinonome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah. But is it really okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because Haruto asked me. Said I should go ahead. Then everything will be fine. Besides—we&#8217;ve got each other, so we’ll definitely come out on top!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other three nodded in agreement with Ichinomiya&#8217;s answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see—all right, let&#8217;s do this!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The party readied their weapons and turned to face Kalamiras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Have you resolved yourselves? Then &#8212; die.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras unleashed a wide range of jet-black magic breath at Tendo and the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thou Holy Sword, protect us!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holy sword barrier that Tendo had activated was able to stop the breath. However, perhaps due to the difference in levels, it gradually cracked and shattered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the meantime, the holy barrier that Ichinomiya had activated with her magic power unfolded within, and Tendo canceled the barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The breath hit the holy barrier, but was completely nullified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh Suzuno, thank goodness!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Oh. You can withstand my breath. As expected of a hero. However…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras jumped up, stayed in the air, and began to inhale the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, his belly swelled up with a gurgling sound, and a breath with more magic power than before was released.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘How about this, think you can avoid it?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five of them moved at the same time, judging that the incoming jet-black breath cannot be prevented by barrier and magic spells alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wooooooooaaa!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Fire Tornado!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Mogami&#8217;s earth magic and Asakura&#8217;s fire magic, Shinonome&#8217;s Flying Slash skill sent countless slashes to reduce the power of the breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the breath was still incredibly powerful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Sacred Barrier!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Holy Sword, bestow unto me the power to protect!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A film of light unfolded around Ichinomiya, and the holy sword barrier that Tendo had activated was stretched out inside it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The barrier, which had blocked the breath earlier due to the reduced power thanks to the holy sword boundary, could not withstand it this time and finally cracked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And through the cracks, the breath attacked the magic powered barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The barrier shrieked and cracked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even with this, still no good huh?! —Holy Sword!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo infused more magic power to the holy sword to strengthen the barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cracks widened, but the power of the breath gradually subsided—and just as the breath was about to come to an end, the barrier shattered.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-56553028' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-56553028' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others avoided the breath that they could not fully prevent, but were blown backward by the blast of the breath that landed on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uhh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Agh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kyah!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kyaah&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras opened his mouth as he watched Tendo and his party roll around on the ground in a heap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Huh&#8230;you could withstand this too? If so, as a show of respect, I will fight you more seriously now.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intimidation radiating from Kalamiras soared up and attacked Tendo and the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they were about to be crushed by the sheer mana itself, Tendo and the others stood up, using their weapons as staffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will fight to the end, to the very end!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““Yeah!”””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of them replied to Tendo&#8217;s words with a strong voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the unyielding heroes, Kalamiras smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Interesting. I won’t let you die so soon.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous chunks of rock about thirty centimeters in diameter were being generated around Kalamiras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to prevent the rock from being released, Tendo and the rest of the party attacked Kalamiras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Kalamiras shot out his magic sharply, without regard to the many direct hits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘How lukewarm, heroes!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others avoided the incoming rocks by shooting them down&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Argh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kyah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They couldn’t avoid all, and took some damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were blown away and rolled on the ground, but even so, Tendo and the others got back up again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What&#8217;s the matter? Is that all you got? &#8230;You&#8217;re not thinking of running away when you see an opening, are you?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not at all. We’re just probing for a path to victory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Hmm, wouldn’t expect any less from a hero. Which makes you worth defeating.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While watching Kalamiras land on the ground smiling happily, Tendo was lost in thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I were to use the Invincible Skill of the holy sword, I might be able to get a shot off. However, with just this ability, I probably wouldn’t be able to deal much damage. What do I do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Tendo realized that a new skill was being created within himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of the skill is—‘Limit Break’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a skill that Haruto also possesses, and when activated, it increases his physical ability and the power of his skills by five times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining this with Invincible and Holy magic, I might be able to deal significant damage to Kalamiras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking so, Tendo made a suggestion to the four of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have an idea. I think the chances of defeating him are slim to none&#8230;but if there&#8217;s even a slight possibility, I’m willing to bet on it. What do you guys think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come on now, do you even have to ask?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mogami went along with Tendo&#8217;s idea, and the other three nodded. Seeing this, Tendo looked relieved for a moment, but he quickly pulled himself together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you—all right, let&#8217;s go!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Hmm? Have you resolved yourselves? My bad, guess you already did from the beginning’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignoring Kalamiras&#8217; words, Tendo and the others began to act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—Spread out!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they moved, they drank the potion Haruto had given them to recover their strength and magic power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They then proceeded to attack Kalamiras from the front, back, left and right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying, this wasn’t enough to inflict any particular damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Kalamiras was getting irritated by the heroes who were buzzing around like flies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swinging his tail, Kalamiras broke the earthen wall created by magic and tried to snuff the life out of one of the heroes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he dodged the attack in a cloud of dust, Mogami shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Koji, are you not done yet? We&#8217;re at our limit already!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Just in time! Thanks guys!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time as Kalamiras flapped his wings to clear away the dust, Tendo leapt in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Invincible!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue magic power erupted from Tendo&#8217;s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this, Kalamiras let out a loud roar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘You think that&#8217;s enough to defeat me? You pitiful human!’</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras barked, believing that his expectations had been let down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Tendo chuckled and shouted again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here it—comes, Limit Break!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if in response to Tendo&#8217;s voice, the holy sword shone with a pale blue light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aaaaaaahhh! —Sacred Judgment!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo put all of his strength and magic into his sword and swung it down from above. It was a blow so powerful that there was nothing more he could do after this attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras, on the other hand, was not about to let this happen unprotected, so he waved his arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Bring it on, hero!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo&#8217;s holy sword swung downwards and Kalamiras&#8217; vicious claws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither of them backing down, and the two attacks collided with each other with pale and black magic power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uooooooohhh!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;‘Oh, to think it packs so much punch. Unfortunately&#8230;’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to Tendo exerting his full force, Kalamiras, on the other hand, still had so much leeway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s still severely lacking’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Kalamiras exerted a little bit of strength, Tendo&#8217;s face lit up with impatience—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aaargh!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was flung away by Kalamiras&#8217; arm and rolled on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mogami and the others rushed to Tendo and held his body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, are you okay?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ug&#8230;&#8230;gh, I-I’m okay. Can’t believe he’s going easy on us, against the five of us to boot&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew that there was a power gap between them because of the difference in levels. However, he did not expect that they wouldn’t stand half a chance to such an extent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Hmmm, it packs quite the punch all right. Didn’t think you’d be able to unleash such power at your level&#8230;still, this is as far as you go’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras said, and deployed multiple spells.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-53928582' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-53928582' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earth magic, lightning magic, wind magic, fire magic&#8230;the amount of magic power contained in all of them was extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Tendo and the rest of the party combined their magic power together, it still wouldn’t come close to the amount of mana contained in the magic circle in front of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it was unlikely that they would be able to prevent such an overwhelming amount of overlapping magic spells.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Tendo and others hadn’t given up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was only one reason for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They wanted to defeat this dragon, stay alive, and eventually defeat the Four Heavenly Kings and the Demon King. And then, return to Earth, to their families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m definitely returning home alive!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Talk about obvious!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll definitely live through this and see Haruto again!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like hell I’m going to croak in a place like this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo, Mogami, Ichinomiya, Asakura and Shinonome put their thoughts into words and wished strongly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While watching them happily, Kalamiras released his magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Good resolve&#8230;now then, shall we begin the final act.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and his party used their body-enhancement skills to avoid the magic that came at them as they approached Kalamiras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it was impossible to avoid everything, they evaded at times, and at other times they braced themselves and tried to avoid any fatal injuries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a situation where even a moment&#8217;s distraction could lead to death, there was no time to use potions, and Ichinomiya saw an opening and applied recovery magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as their magic power began to run out and their body enhancements were removed, their movements slowed down and the amount of attacks they received in turn increased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time the attacks stopped, everyone was lying in tatters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Hmmm&#8230;I guess even a hero only amounts to this much, huh?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ughh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others didn&#8217;t even have the strength to say anything back, let alone stand up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Well then, I know you all must be in pain, so. Let me put you out of your misery.’</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras opened his jaws wide to deliver the final blow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic power even more denser than the previous began to converge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Is this the end?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mogami and Ichinomiya lowered their heads as if they had given up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there was one person who stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—It was Tendo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stood in front of them, dragging his battered body to protect his friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, not yet! It&#8217;s not over—yet!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though he has almost no magic power left, he is forcing himself to use his Limit Break skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing his back, Mogami and Ichinomiya shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t be reckless! You&#8217;ll destroy your body!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as if Tendo didn&#8217;t hear their words, he tried to infuse more magic power into his body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Oh, you&#8217;re still standing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re definitely going back! To our country, our homes, to our families!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I applaud your determination.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras closed his mouth and diffused his magic power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Very well. I will give you a chance to wield the power that is now dwelling in you to the fullest!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was at this point that Tendo finally realized what was happening to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill Limit Break had evolved through Tendo&#8217;s unyielding will and turned into a new skill, &#8220;Extreme Break”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Extreme Break skill has an increase in ability beyond the Limit Break and the ability to recover magic power when activated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an extremely powerful skill, but since it gave the user power far beyond their own capabilities, there was a risk that it would also cause serious damage to the user.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Tendo didn&#8217;t seem to care about that, and let the magic power he had just recovered circulate throughout his body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holy sword also increased its brilliance, as if in response.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-85045740' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-85045740' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m ready!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Good, bring it on Hero!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras cloaked his arms and claws in jet-black mana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh Holy sword, cut through everything in your path!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo swung his holy sword, which was covered with a dense, pale blue magic power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Kalamiras&#8217; claws glowed black—and two powerful mana collided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haaaaaaaaaaaa! Not yet, not yet! It&#8217;s not over yet!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The earth shook and the space trembled from the violent impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two forces were in conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, a scratch appeared on Kalamiras&#8217; claw. However—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How naive!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ggh, ghaaaaahh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo was blown away and rolled on the ground to the four of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““““Koji?!””””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four of them stood up with the last of their strength and rushed to Tendo&#8217;s side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo&#8217;s chest was ripped wide open, and they could see that he would not be able to hold on much longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This is the end.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras once again began converging dense jet-black mana out of his open mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘So long. Brave hero and his comrades.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;PLEASE HELP, HARUTO&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment of desperation, Ichinomiya crossed her arms in front of her chest and muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She prayed that her beloved would come to her rescue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the words could reach Kalamiras, the breath attack was directed at the five of them—and then he appeared before Tendo and his party. </span></p>
