<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Synuclein Disease and Disaster at the Imperial's Cathedral</h3>


<p class="calibre1">“You’re a court pharmacist?! Why didn’t you tell me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wasn’t trying to hide it or anything, I just forgot to mention it” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While preparing to head home, the de Medicis siblings had a little argument in the waiting room. It’s been over two years since Falma first became a court pharmacist, and he felt a little guilty that he had outperformed Palle at only 10 years old. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My little brother has surpassed me, I’m devastated!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle was in a bad mood, so Falma earnestly apologized to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, it was my bad” </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Rather, why am I apologizing?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Palle wasn’t convinced. While breathing heavily, he declared that he would endure falling behind for a while longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever, I’ll catch up to you in five years!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you need five years? You’ve already written a textbook, so you should take the court pharmacist exam” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are numerous strict prerequisites to becoming a court pharmacist, but passing the exam was the most important one. Falma was forced by the other court pharmacists to take it, but he didn’t think it was that difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not that easy to pass! It even took Father 15 years! If you make just one mistake, you’ll be barred from re-taking it for three years, so how can I possibly treat it lightly?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">To Palle, Bruno must be insurmountable, thought Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that so… I thought it would be easy for my brother to pass, it really wasn’t that difficult” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah- is that right? You must be a big fan of sarcasm” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, sorry” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma thought that with Palle’s knowledge, he could become a court pharmacist after only one year of training. Although it might be unpopular for the de Medicis family to monopolize the position of court pharmacist, Palle had really great potential. He just didn’t seem to understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyways, you’re…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the siblings walked and argued, a passing lady-in-waiting tripped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kya-!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you alright?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma called out instinctively. She was a lady-in-waiting who was in her thirties and took care of a higher-class noble as a courtier. Falma didn’t recognize her. She lightly bowed her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh my, this is very shameful. I had just arrived yesterday and so I’m a bit nervous” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be careful where you step” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle watched her retreating figure intently as she meekly walked away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s go, older brother” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t it weird? People don’t usually trip here” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe she absentmindedly caught the hem of her dress. Sometimes that makes you stumble” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please wait!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle called out to the lady-in-waiting to stop her. As he watched, she tripped again before turning around to face Palle, who examined her closely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, what is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  lady-in-waiting  was  worried  that  she  had  been  rude  or  had  done  something wrong because of how intensely Palle was staring at her and was on guard. However, Palle didn’t seem bothered at all while he looked all over the bewildered lady’s body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if it were two women, this sort of staring would still be rude. Her fingers began to tremble little by little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Older brother, what’s wrong?… please excuse us, Madame” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle ignored Falma and asked the lady-in-waiting a question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My  apologies,  Madame.  Have  these  tremors  gotten  worse  lately?  What  about  the tripping?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pal e began to perform a medical interview. As a first-class pharmacist, he wasn’t allowed to examine the Empress or other royals, but courtiers and other court people were fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, it wasn’t forbidden to treat her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes… that’s right” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you find something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma was interested in what Palle had to say. Then Falma observed her condition again and realized what Palle had noticed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s likely to be Synuclein Disease, although the possibility of stroke or hydrocephalus can’t be ruled out” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma had arrived at the same conclusion as Palle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Parkinson’s Disease” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore,  using  his  divine  sight,  Falma  could  eliminate  the  possibility  of  other </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">diseases. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parkinson’s disease and Synuclein disease refer to the same condition. When Falma introduces a new disease in his textbook, he sometimes gives it a different name than what it was referred to on Earth. In particular, the diseases that were named after people couldn’t be introduced as-is, so Falma renamed them to better reflect their pathology and etiology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, Parkinson’s disease is thought to be related to the buildup of dopaminergic neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies, which were shown to contain aggregates of α-Synuclein. As such, Falma gave it the generic name of Synuclein disease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parkinson’s disease can cause tremors and loss of balance, even at rest. It can also cause slow muscular movement. There are other symptoms, but Palle didn’t miss the cardinal signs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it a serious illness? Oh no… what should I do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,  the  lady-in-waiting’s  trembling  began  to  worsen.  Stress  accelerates  the progression of Parkinson’s disease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right, it’s a progressive disease known as Synuclein disease. We should begin treatment as soon as possible” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Palle finished his explanation, Falma interjected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not immediately life-threatening, but please answer some more questions for me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Please  get  permission  to  come  to  the  Other  World  Pharmacy  tomorrow  as  well because I’ll prescribe some tests and medicine. I’m Falma, by the way, the owner of the Other World Pharmacy. Give these documents to the Chief Court Physician. I’d also like to ask you about your age, hometown, family medical history, etc. Do you have some time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma brought her to the waiting room where he performed the interview. He also wrote a medical certificate and instructed her to have Claude sign it. If both the court pharmacist and court physician approve, then the courtier would be allowed to seek medical treatment outside of the court. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since it wasn’t possible to do a full medical examination in the waiting room, Falma invited the lady-in-waiting to the pharmacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t worry, we’ll provide all of the necessary treatment” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle offered words of encouragement to the nervous woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks to my older brother, I’ve found a new patient!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma expressed his gratitude to Palle. Now he needed to go back and create a new medical chart for her. While Falma tries to examine al  the courtiers every three months, he doesn’t always use his divine sight and might miss some new patients. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The drug should either make up for the lack of dopamine caused by the buildup of synuclein, or inhibit the buildup of synuclein altogether” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems that Pal e, who helped write the textbook, hasn’t forgotten the correct treatment for this disease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because  this  is  early  onset,  we  should  start  with  l-DOPA  or  a  dopamine  receptor agonist first” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“l-DOPA? Won’t dopamine by itself work?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even if ingested, dopamine can’t enter the brain because there is a system known as the blood-brain barrier which prevents molecules from passing through. l-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) mimics the effect of dopamine, but has been processed to  pass  through  the  barrier.  Let’s  think  about  this  after  seeing  the  results  of  the examination. Furthermore, because we don’t know about the family’s medical record, let’s check family members as well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see… the medicine for this disease, it was a divine revelation by the Medicine God, right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle pondered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uhh, well…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">I’ll feel guilty if you say that</i>) </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Palle still had some doubts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why not a drug that can break down the accumulated synuclein? Isn’t that the root </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">cause?  I don’t  think a symptomatic treatment that doesn’t  address the problem at hand is the best approach here” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m glad you noticed” </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">Or rather, it’s a very scientific point of view</i>) Falma was excited by this promising development. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As an alternative solution, artificial stem cells such as iPS cells can be injected into the brain in order to produce dopamine. However, it’s not practical in this world… and it also doesn’t address the root cause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re right. My textbook is by no means perfect and as you know, there are some diseases which can’t be cured” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma only knows of Earth’s pharmaceutics up to the 21st century. In order to advance further, the people of this world must work as one to acquire the new knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I believe in my guardian deity, the Medicine God, from the bottom of my heart. He knows all that there is to know about pharmaceutics. That’s why I wonder why you won’t teach us your knowledge. Is this mankind’s next trial…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle seemed to be worried about the true intentions of the guardian deity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The will of the guardian deity is unfathomable” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle quietly said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">TN:  I  decided  to  translate  the  dialogue  literally  and  provide  context  here,  so  I  don’t</i> <i class="calibre3">misrepresent what level of detail Falma is providing. If you’re interested, please do some</i> <i class="calibre3">research on your own – it’s very interesting! </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">A dopamine receptor agonist is the generic term for a compound that activates dopamine</i> <i class="calibre3">receptors. It’s usually used with, but not necessarily concurrently, l-DOPA. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The  blood-brain  barrier  prevents,  among  other  things,  large  polar  molecules  from</i> <i class="calibre3">entering the central nervous system. Dopamine is a polar molecule, and so it can’t cross </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">the barrier. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dopamine </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">L-DOPA is both a polar molecule and an amino acid, so it’s transported across the barrier</i> <i class="calibre3">by L-type transport proteins. From there, it undergoes decarboxylation with the help of</i> <i class="calibre3">aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase to become dopamine. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">l-DOPA </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Finally, iPS cells are a type of stem cell, which itself is a type of cell that can differentiate</i> <i class="calibre3">into other types of cells. In this case, iPS cells may be derived into dopaminergic neurons,</i> <i class="calibre3">which can synthesize dopamine. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I’m going to stop by the pharmacy to prepare medicine for a patient” </p>
<p class="calibre1">On his way home, Falma stopped by the pharmacy where the Baroness Melodie was waiting for him. Every 5 days she came to the pharmacy to have her warts treated, and she greeted Falma cheerful y. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome back, shopkeeper-sama” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry to have kept you waiting” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No problem, I had a chat with Lotte-san while I waited, it was quite fun” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow, Lotte had become good friends with Melodie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A chat?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma looked at them suspiciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ehehe, I talked a lot with Melodie-sama!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte was in a good mood as well. Melodie was deeply knowledgeable in the arts and was curious about glass arts. While discussing glass arts, the two of them hit it off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They drew designs and made plans to collaborate on future glasswork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking around, there were designs for things such as glass brooches and glass vases scattered everywhere. Apparently, they were planning on holding an exhibition and selling their works. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">While I was gone, this is what you talked about…? </i>) </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I look forward to the exhibition” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good relationships between patrons and staff was something that Falma welcomed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well then, I’ll freeze the warts again” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma quickly treated the warts with liquid nitrogen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just a little more to go. I think it’ll be cured after one more session” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you. The quick treatment has been really helpful” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, any growth beyond this would’ve been very troublesome” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m glad there was no pain because of the anesthesia too” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liquid nitrogen is a painful treatment because typically no anesthesia is used, but Falma applied some topical anesthesia and that seems to have prevented any pain. He also carefully regulates the dosage of liquid nitrogen. There were so many warts that he had to be patient, but it paid off and progress has been steady. Furthermore, Melodie started  drinking  Job’s  Tears  tea  with  the  hope  that  it  would  provide  therapeutic benefits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was that the last patient for today?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">El en finished up her work and stretched. As she relaxed, Lotte massaged her shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks for helping. There were a lot of patients today” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ahhh- that feels so good. Thanks, Lotte-chan. Are your shoulders stiff as well?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I’m fine” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  Falma  was  away,  Ellen  skillfully  ran  the  pharmacy.  The  three  part-time pharmacists also worked well under her guidance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come to think of it, has Solomon-san come to the pharmacy today?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma suddenly remembered and asked Cedric, who stopped working and put down his pen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I haven’t seen him” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wonder what happened, maybe he caught a cold?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte thought about it as well. It’s been a week since she last saw him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Solomon always stopped by, whether it was rainy or windy, so Falma thought there must be an extraordinary reason for him to stop coming. There was a period where Falma wasn’t at the pharmacy because he was giving his undivided attention to Palle’s treatment. However, Falma saw him every day afterwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, I don’t think it’s because of a cold” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Solomon visits the pharmacy regularly, so it should be less likely for him to catch a cold. Besides, it’s been too long even if he did have a cold. While it was a bit irritating to Falma for Solomon to carefully observe his every move, it was a bit lonely without him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe the head priest is busy” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cedric was indifferent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think I’ll stop by the cathedral on my way home” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you’re worried, then why not? I haven’t gone to the cathedral in a while, so I’ll come with you. Lotte-chan, what about you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have a meeting with Melodie-sama about the glasswork…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems that Lotte was invited to dinner at Melodie’s mansion, and she was curious what sort of food might be served. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see. Well, let’s go together, Falma-kun” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After closing the pharmacy for the evening, Falma and Ellen went to the cathedral together. As they approached, Falma noticed that all the priests were new. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma stopped, feeling uneasy inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since Ellen doesn’t come to the cathedral as often, she didn’t notice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The priests, have they changed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold on a sec, Falma-kun” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen, who didn’t fully understand Falma’s question, pulled on his sleeve and turned him around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did you just say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All of the priests are different. The head priest is new too” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The head priest wears a special hat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Currently, that hat was worn by an unfamiliar face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Solomon-san was just appointed to this position, so it’s not time to replace him yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">New head priests are also expected to introduce themselves to the Empress… besides, I don’t think he would’ve left without saying goodbye to you” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Ellen’s words, Falma’s expression hardened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It seems that something has happened” </p>
