<h2>Chapter 3 &#8211; Request in the Holy City</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day after arriving in the capital, I, Haruto, along with everyone else decided to take a stroll around the city in search of local specialties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There weren’t that many food stalls in the city, but quite a number of accessory stores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went into the nearest accessory store that caught my eye, and found that expensive items were displayed in showcases, while other reasonably priced items were placed so that I could easily pick them up and take a look at them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average price was about a thousand gold, a reasonable price for an accessory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more expensive accessories have various effects enchanted to them and are priced accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Guys, let me know if there’s anything that catches your attention!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, there are some pretty cute ones, maybe I can get some of them. Not as a souvenir or anything though&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne picked up a small accessory and started checking it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How about Iris?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think I’ll have some too. Since we&#8217;re all here, it would be nice to have something to commemorate our visit, like Finne said.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, y’all take whatever you want, on me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sounds good!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ladies are all right, but what about Zero?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His outfit is pretty much that of a butler, so I&#8217;m not sure if there are any accessories in the store that would suit him&#8230;well, if there aren’t, I&#8217;ll make one for him later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this in mind, I waited for everyone to choose what they wanted, but for some reason, they all stared at me without choosing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are they perhaps telling me to choose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guessing the meaning behind their stares, I looked at the accessories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I agonized for a while and then decided on the perfect one for each of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bracelet with small sky blue gemstones for Finne, a bracelet with small scarlet gemstones for Iris. I bought a crimson hairpin for Kusel, a bracelet with inlaid jade-colored gems for Ephyr, and a cherry-pink bracelet for Suzuno.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Asha, a necklace with inlaid small yellow gems that would not interfere with her work, and for Zero, a pair of black earrings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was happy with their gifts, saying “thank you” in unison. Iris was like, “This is love!”, Finne heard that and turned all red trying to make out the word, “L-Love&#8230;”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha was hesitant to accept the gift at first, but when I told her it was a token of my appreciation, she took it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We then spent a fulfilling day touring the various stores and finding the specialties that we had been looking for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third day after arriving in the holy city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today was a free day for everyone, so I chose to relax at the inn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was sure everyone was tired, and since we had already enjoyed the best parts of the trip, like the most popular tourist attractions as well as the delicious food, it was about time we took a rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was relaxing on the first floor of the inn, Asha approached me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Master Haruto, are you free today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh Asha. Yeah I am&#8230;wait, is Iris not with you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lady Iris went to see Lady Ilmina, and Finne, Suzuno and Ephyr all offered to be her escorts. And Lady Iris said to me ‘Asha, you should also take it easy once in a while’.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she could just do as told and take it easy, but the fact that she came to me means that&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But you don’t exactly have anything to do, huh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Should we try visiting the adventurers&#8217; guild, see if we can take one or two quests? I was about getting bored myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Kusel came down the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I heard something about a quest?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheesh, what keen ears&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You want to come with, Kusel?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing Kusel’s reply I returned my focus and Asha nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m okay with it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay. I&#8217;ll join you then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel said merrily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess it’s us three today&#8230;speaking of which, where is Zero?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was thinking that, the door to the inn opened and Zero entered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems he was out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero looked at me and tilted his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Master Haruto, are you going out?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought I’d go and see if there’s any decent quest I could take.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I see. Then, let me go and get ready.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I noticed the books Zero was carrying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you buy all those?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. Some of them seem kind of interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then I presume you can’t wait to read them, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not really&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero denied it, but I could see it in his expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re free today. Spend your time doing what you want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I understand. It seems that there’s no use hiding anything in front of you, Master Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You bet, it’s written all over your face. When Finne and the others return, tell them we&#8217;ve gone to take on a quest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, after getting ready, Asha, Kusel, and I left the inn and headed for the adventurers&#8217; guild.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as we arrived in front of the guild building, we could hear the hustle and bustle through the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s so noisy that it almost passed for lively&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening the door, we finally realized what the bustle was all about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sunnavabitch! I got in here before you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?! Keep dreaming, I clearly came in before you!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The hell you did, muddafucka!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What, you wanna go?! With that mug of yours that look like a goblin’s!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who ya callin’ a goblin? Look who’s talkin’ when ya the one who looks like a goddamn ogre!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two adventurers were bickering with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They looked like they could start throwing punches at each other at any moment, but no one around them was paying them any mind&#8230;rather, more like they’re steering clear. They are acting as if it’s a normal thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few people gave us a second glance as we entered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;It’s the adventurers’ guild, alright.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yup. I guess the adventurers&#8217; guild is the same everywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of us, me, Asha, and Kusel, all said different things, but it seemed we were all thinking the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we were about to pass through the two bickering people, we were approached by a voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey there. You saw who joined the line first, right? Was I not the one?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was clearly the one, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait, we just came in here, so how should we know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We looked at each other once, and then&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““No idea.”””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We said that and got in line at the reception&#8230;passing by the two dimwits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right after that, both of them grabbed me by the shoulders at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, you&#8217;ve got some balls jumping us both, must be pretty huge?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were first in line, remember?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned around——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I lightly released a burst of intimidation toward the two of them alone, and they both let out a small scream “hieek?!”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Listen, the line isn’t moving no thanks to your squabbling. Now that you know, you can take it outside if you want to fight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““We’re sorry!!””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two stopped fighting and lined up behind us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good. This is better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Master Haruto, we’re actually jumping the line, aren&#8217;t we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asha, don&#8217;t say that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I paid no heed to Asha’s words as she stared at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things went smoothly from there, and then it was our turn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How can I help you today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told the receptionist what I wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can you find me a quest that the three of us can take on and be done by late afternoon or early evening?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood. May I please see your adventurer cards?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha, Kusel, and I presented our adventurer cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha, who was a C-rank adventurer, presented hers, followed by Kusel, who was an A-rank adventurer, which I guess caught the receptionist by surprise and she whispered, “Wow, you’re an A-rank adventurer?!”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, when it was my turn to present my card, I told her, “Please try not to be surprised”, before handing her my adventurer’s card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somewhat predictably, the receptionist&#8217;s reaction was anything but surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She froze as if time had stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s your fault, Master Haruto!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yup, it sure is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha and Kusel were blaming me, but I couldn&#8217;t argue with them because they were right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t just leave it at that, though, so I called out to the receptionist who was still frozen, then she snapped out of it and hurriedly apologized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“M-My apologies, sir!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh come on, you don’t have to apologize&#8230;anyway, so, any luck with the quest I asked for? Even if it’s on the risky side, I’ll be participating as well so don’t hold back. So please find me something good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A-All right! Right on it, sir!” </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇ ◇ ◇ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist, who had gone to see to the request, returned in a few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How about this one? Although it may be a little lacking considering your ranks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We checked the request form she presented to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The content of the quest was to subjugate a horde of ogres.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difficulty level of subjugating a single ogre is B-rank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Asha at the moment is only a C-rank, her training has made her more than capable, so she can handle two or three ogres at the same time, with no problem. Kusel, on the other hand, is already as good as an S-rank, and if the need arises, I will be there, so they won’t be in any danger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was checking the request form with this in mind, the receptionist explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a subjugation quest of a horde of ogres, and it’s been confirmed that there’s an Ogre King among them. The difficulty level is an A-rank, leaning close to an S-rank, but since Master Haruto will also be participating, I decided it shouldn’t be a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded at the receptionist&#8217;s explanation and then asked Asha and Kusel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll leave it to you two to decide whether to take it or not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha was a little worried, but decided to vote on taking it saying, “I think it’ll make for a good training opportunity since you’re also here, Master Haruto”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel seemed more enthusiastic, saying, “This should be fun”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After confirming this, I turned to the receptionist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You heard them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood. Then let me begin the process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few moments later, the process was completed and the final explanation was given.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please bring the horns of the king and other high-ranking individuals as proof of subjugation of the horde.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We immediately left the adventurers&#8217; guild and headed for the forest on the outskirts of the holy city, as specified in the quest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took us only fifteen minutes to get there, and from there we walked deeper into the forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encountered some goblins along the way, but they were just the normal bunch and were killed instantly by Asha and Kusel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were really dependable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After walking for a while, Asha muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No sign of an ogre here at all much less a horde.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tell me about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha&#8217;s words were met with a nod from Kusel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, there&#8217;s no reaction to my normal detect presence skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used the map function of my &lt;God Eye&gt; to search a wider area, and when I probed further into the area, I caught multiple reactions that seemed to be a horde of ogres.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Found them. They&#8217;re just a little further in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We continued on our way toward the horde.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, I’ve got movement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After advancing for a while, Kusel seemed to have detected the presence of the ogres.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tad bit later, Asha also seemed to have found them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a closer look, we found that among the horde scattered over a wide area, there was one particularly large one. Perhaps this is the Ogre King that the receptionist had mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Found one that looks like the Ogre King. The size of the horde is about fifty&#8230;you good?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha and Kusel nodded, their expressions tightening at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We then closed in a little more and approached the two ogres on the outer perimeter of the horde.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogres didn’t seem to have caught on to our presence yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are two of them. Which one of you will do the honors?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll do it. This is the first time you&#8217;ll be going against an ogre, right, Asha?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. Please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Kusel responded to my question, Asha nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel then drew her sword from her waist and stepped in front of the ogre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre noticed Kusel&#8217;s presence and tried to raise its weapon, but it was too late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoever strikes first wins.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying this, Kusel channeled mana into her sword and swung it diagonally from below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the sword cut deep into the ogre&#8217;s belly, Kusel turned her sword towards the other ogre in a fluid motion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre, which had lost one of its companions, shook its fist at Kusel in panic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a slowpoke.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while spilling such words, Kusel leisurely observed the approaching ogre&#8217;s fist and cut off its left arm from its shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then circled instantly to the back of the screaming ogre and pierced it through the heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After wiping off the bloodstain on her sword by swinging it, Kusel returned to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just like that. Ogres are slow, so the trick lies in the movement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, she opted first so she could show Asha the ropes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s a very good performance, Kusel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh please, it’s not worth mentioning. Assuming there were five of them now, it may have been a little challenging.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah right, she probably would have made quick work of them altogether, or is it just my imagination&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was thinking this, Ellis, the ego created by the auxiliary function of my Extra Skill, All of Creation, answered me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;No, it’s exactly as you surmised, master, the current Kusel can handle five ogres at the same time. I believe she can handle at most ten of them at once without using any skills but her pure physical abilities.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoa, that’s so badass&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If so, that means Kusel alone could pretty much handle this quest all by herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Probably.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks like the lady receptionist totally botched this one. Then again, it may very well be most appropriate, if she picked the quest solely based on our ranks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Speaking of which, I wonder what the determining factor for Ellis making an appearance and not, is. Or maybe it’s on a whim. Even now, it doesn’t seem like she’s psyched to answer me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, these ogres are somehow arranged as if they are monitoring their territory, aren&#8217;t they?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Ellis answered immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Affirmative. The Ogre King seems to be leaving its territory in the hands of its subordinates.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks like my guess was right on the mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if they heard the screams of the ogre earlier, wouldn&#8217;t they converge on this spot?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Yes, in a few minutes, a horde of ogres will gather here.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I checked the map, I found that a large number of ogres were indeed making their way down here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, two of them appeared at a visible distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asha, think you can take ‘em on?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the ogres in the direction I indicated, Asha took out her knife and readied herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two ogres that had arrived had found the corpses of their kin and were scurrying around, searching the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to go about engaging them would depend on Asha’s timing.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha had been looking for an opening, but she rushed out at the right moment to exploit a blind spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre then swung its fist hastily towards Asha, who suddenly leaped in front of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha leapt to avoid the swinging fist and threw several knives at the back of the rattled ogre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knives lodged into the ogre&#8217;s back, but&#8230;were a little shallow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That wouldn&#8217;t cause any real damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other ogre picked up a small rock about thirty centimeters in diameter and threw it at Asha, who landed on her feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Ow?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha tried to avoid it as quickly as she could, but was out of luck and the rock grazed her side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her maid&#8217;s uniform, which she had stubbornly refused to change out of even though she knew she would have to fight, got torn, and blood soaked through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Asha was not intimidated, and as she approached the ogre with the knives in its back, she grabbed the two knives that were still stuck in and stabbed them even deeper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre&#8217;s screams of pain echoed through the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not over yet!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha then pulled out one of the knives used in the stabbing and threw it at the other ogre from a distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knife hit the ogre in the ankle, or more precisely, in the tendon of its foot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre fell to the ground and put its hands on the ground attempting to get up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Asha quickly took out an additional knife and threw it at the back of its neck that was left unguarded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gaaaaaahh——&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the ogre fell to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, one was down, and another to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre that had thrown a small rock earlier was now lifting a large rock, about two meters in diameter, and then threw it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It flew straight toward Asha, sending up a cloud of dust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre, perhaps trying to check on the corpse, approached the rock and lifted it up, but——lo and behold, Asha was nowhere to be found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then Asha appeared from above it, with knives between the fingers of both hands, and threw all of it at the defenseless ogre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knives stabbed into both eyes, wrists, and ankles, and the last one plunged deep into the ogre&#8217;s forehead, ending its life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha retrieved the knives and returned to me and Kusel, brushing the dust off her maid&#8217;s uniform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How’d I do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Brilliantly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really——ow?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha looked happy, but then she frowned and screamed, as if the graze on her abdomen had hurt her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me see that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said this, Asha showed me the wound, though she looked embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t deep, but there&#8217;s some dirt in the wound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s going to sting a little, but bear with it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I rinsed the wound with water conjured from magic and removed the dirt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha let out a small “ouch” as the water seeped into the wound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wound then closed up nicely after I applied recovery magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good, it didn’t leave a scar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There you go. Does it still hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-No. Not anymore. Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Asha thanked me, I replied with, “It’s no biggie”, and Kusel, who had been watching silently until then, opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asha. Never forget it&#8217;s two against one. The wound you sustained just now was because it slipped your mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. I got a little careless because the ogres were sluggish.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel stole the limelight and said what I was going to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, don&#8217;t be discouraged. You did good, so next time you&#8217;ll just have to be on your guard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, sir!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha clenched her hands as she raised her voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, nearly a dozen ogres appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You two want to give it a shot? Or should I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, we&#8217;ll take ‘em on together. That okay with you, Asha?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course. I&#8217;ll try not to hold you back!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha held up her knives and Kusel drew her sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let&#8217;s go, Asha!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel rushed in and approached the ogres, swinging her sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ogre was closing in behind her, and about to swing its clenched fist at Kusel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh no, you don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Asha threw a knife at the ogre, which pierced its neck ending its life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there on, Kusel just frantically continued swinging her sword and Asha continued throwing her knives to cover her blindspots&#8230;and just like that, in no time at all, they had defeated ten ogres.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good job, both of you. So, Kusel, what’d you think about Asha?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Kusel, while commending both of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, she made it fairly easy to fight, that&#8217;s for sure. By leaving my back to her to take care of the enemies behind me, I was able to go on a rampage as much as I wanted without care.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel nodded in satisfaction, and Asha looked pleased with the praise. I was relieved to see that their fighting styles seemed to mesh well.</span></p>
