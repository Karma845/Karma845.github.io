<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chapter 003 – The Protagonist Named Arthur</strong></h2>
<p>Two years passed just like that. I desperately swung my sword, aiming for the greater height fully expecting the encounter with the Final Boss someday. I was a protagonist who was filled with the aspiration to improve. The people of the orphanage were scared of this. They gave me something like a respectful gaze. Ever since the duel against Tlue back then, he no longer interrupted me. Perhaps he got scared of me.</p>
<p>Or perhaps there were no more scenes involving him? Since he was a mob character, perhaps his role ended once an event where he appeared in is resolved, or was it? Well, I will just think about myself for now.　</p>
<p>In order to play an active role as a paladin, I participated in the enrollment test of the knight brigade with the name of Knights of the Round Table in the capital of the Britannia Kingdom.　</p>
<p>It wasn’t that far from the orphanage, so I could return home anytime. It was just that the knight brigade also provided a dormitory where knights could stay in.　</p>
<p>Uh-n, it felt kind of wrong for a protagonist to return home anytime, somehow… With that in mind, I told Maria that I wouldn’t return until I became a hero, <span id="easy-footnote-1-19830" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-19830" title="T/N: hero here is Eiyuu, which is different from the common hero in fiction, Yuusha. IMHO, Eiyuu is achievement based while Yuusha is Blessing based"><sup>1</sup></a></span>　</p>
<p>“I won’t return until I’ve achieved my goal… until then, farewell, Maria.”　</p>
<p>And it turned into such words. Then Maria began to cry and said things like “Are we really not gonna meet anymore?” and “Please don’t lie,” so I felt troubled about it. It made me realize once again that Maria was a worrywart.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>I then visited the headquarters of the knight brigade at the capital city Britannia to take the enrollment test of the Knights of the Round Table. It was a big building. Although it was definitely smaller than the Britannia castle nearby, how to say this, it was large both vertically and horizontally which gave off a sense of security like an apartment, maybe?　</p>
<p>It was a four-story building, I guess? As the candidates who took the entrance examination were to finish the registration and wait outside, I proceeded to look around while waiting.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>There were several people with similar ages around.　</p>
<p>No matter how much I thought about it, they were destined to&nbsp; become my stepping stones, thank you very much. I neither overestimate nor underestimate myself. But if I had to evaluate myself, I would always stay the best I could be. I was the protagonist after all. There was no way I could lose against them, right?　</p>
<p>And surprisingly, Tlue seemed to be taking the entrance exam to join the knight brigade as well. Seriously? I didn’t know at all. Well, let’s just leave him alone.　</p>
<p>Well then, although I could mingle with other candidates,&nbsp; in these two years I was convinced I was the cool-type protagonist and lived accordingly. I just silently waited for the test to begin.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>I leaned against a tree in a cool fashion, folding my arms and closing my eyes. This was exactly the protagonist’s cool and stylish waiting pose.　</p>
<p><em>Well, I didn’t think I would wait for long though</em>, as I thought of that… I felt someone approaching my spot so I opened my eyes. I saw beautiful, long blond hair which extended to the waist. The person had a violet colored eye for the left and a blue colored eye for the right. She was a beautiful girl with nice body proportions.　</p>
<p>Wow, this was a seriously beautiful person…　</p>
<p>Why did this girl come here? Perhaps she fell for me at first sight?! Ah-, that was a possibility. I was the protagonist, so this girl might possibly be a heroine. In that case, Maria wasn’t the heroine then?　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>As I thought about such things… somebody came out from the headquarter building of the knight brigade.　</p>
<p>“Okay then, hello, future heroes-. My name is Marumaru, a fifth-grade paladin-.” 　</p>
<p>It was a sullen voice, coming from a handsome man with blue hair and blue eyes. I would have definitely been jealous of him in my previous life. It was because these kinds of men were popular. However, I was the protagonist in my current life and cute heroines were guaranteed to come my way so I wouldn’t get jealous of him.　</p>
<p>Even so, the examiner was a fifth-grade paladin, huh. The paladins in the Britannia Kingdom had a concept of grading from twelve to first, and it was said the lower the number, the greater their ability as a knight. Fifth-grade… Well, I’ll eventually make it there. After all, my potential should land me the first-grade, or perhaps even zero-grade in the future.　</p>
<p>“Well then, although we indeed do entrance exams, we are always lacking knights all the time, so we can consider everyone here as having passed the examination. The training during the temporary enrollment period is more important anyway…”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Ah-, can you say such a thing as the examiner? Certainly, paladins in this world were always sent into danger. Because of that, the majority of people didn’t want to become one.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>However, they made a reasonable sum. That was why they still gathered like this, even if the number were small. Well, I wouldn’t talk about that kind of small scale though.　</p>
<p>“That’s why, just do things casually-. And so, well, it’s a test for formality at least? Just do it with such a feeling. Can you all form a pair?”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Eh, what will you do?”　</p>
<p>“How about teaming up with me?!”</p>
<p>“I guess it can’t be helped!”</p>
<p>“Is there anyone willing to pair with me?!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It was probably because the examiner told them that they already passed the exam, the stepping stones in similar age as me began raising their dumb voices. What a low level thing to do. Well, I was the protagonist, so I would always give my all. I will tighten my focus… ah, what should I do about pairing…?</p>
<p>“Hey.”　</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’m talking with you…”</p>
<p>“You mean me?”</p>
<p>“That’s right… is there anyone else instead of you here?”</p>
<p>“I see… and what of it?”</p>
<p>“Why do you wear such expressions?”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>&#8230;Did this girl say I was ugly in a roundabout way? The blond haired beauty from earlier was speaking to me. Although I was a little happy about that… I wonder what she meant by expression?　</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”　</p>
<p>“I mean it literally… Everyone else is already relaxed. But you alone, aren’t so… why?”</p>
<p>Ah, so that was what she meant. I thought she was making fun of me. It was hard to read her expression somehow. Although she was a beauty, she felt cold like a doll or something… Well, her face gave off such an impression the most though.　</p>
<p>“Why are you asking for obvious things? One can’t grow unless they are always trying to surpass themselves. That’s all to it.”　</p>
<p>Well, why did these kinds of quote-like words come out from my mouth? Well, I guess as expected of me.　</p>
<p>“…I see, so that’s how it is… I finally realized it.”　</p>
<p>“…Hm?”</p>
<p>“The examiner did say all of us already passed. However, <strong>he didn’t say he won’t rank us depending on our performance. </strong>This was the exam to be a paladin who always bet their lives during their duty, so there’s no way nothing is being tested at all. This test is about how one puts their self-control in a loose environment, and they will evaluate that. Did you notice such hidden evaluation from the start?”</p>
<p>“…Fuh, obviously.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>I didn’t notice at all. So that was the test. I just found out now. But I really was the protagonist after all. Most things that happened would resolve automatically. As expected of me.　</p>
<p>“…Make a pair with me.”　</p>
<p>“…I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>As expected, to have this kind of beauty as my pair… I really was the protagonist. The world was backing me up.　</p>
<p>“Well then, it seems everyone already made your pairing. The exam is simple, and I already told you earlier that you already passed. Well then, there are wooden swords for training purposes I prepared for this exam. You all are to take these swords and swing them toward your pair continuously… Do not stop until you are told to. Do you understand?”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Fuh, it’s time to see how much I have learned for the two years of my training. I will show my strength to this blond girl in front of me. Then I will make her say things like “How are you that strong?! I will be your slave until I can win against you!” <span id="easy-footnote-2-19830" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-19830" title="T/N: refers to Rakudai Kishi no Eiyuutan, or A Chivalry of Failed Knight."><sup>2</sup></a></span>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Ah, by the way… What’s your name?”　</p>
<p>“Fay.”</p>
<p>“I see, as for my name… It’s <strong>Arthur.</strong>” <span id="easy-footnote-3-19830" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-19830" title="T/N: yep, it’s totally a boy&amp;#8217;s name for a beautiful woman. Just blame her parents for it."><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
<p>That sounded like a protagonist-like name. Wasn’t Arthur the name of a historical figure? Now I thought about this, the novel game this world based on was titled “Round Tabled Heroes” was it? Ah-, did that mean she was the protagonist…?　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>No, that wasn’t the case. I was the protagonist. Besides, the name of the historical figure had no copyright, so it was likely some parents just happened to name their child with the same name. I felt the name was already saturated, or rather, expired as a protagonist name.　</p>
<p>But well, considering her name was Arthur… She was either a heroine or someone with a similar position. Their position was still inferior to me who was the protagonist, though.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Okay, you may get started.”　</p>
<p>“Please take care of me, Fay.”　</p><div class="watas-bc6d3ec6ebba6eed8e26349f82f098aa watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-bc6d3ec6ebba6eed8e26349f82f098aa"></div>
<p>At the Marumaru’s signal, Arthur pointed her wooden sword at me. I also pointed my sword toward her.</p>
<p>“Aah, let’s begin… Arthur. This will be a struggle… between you and I.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>That line decided it… This quote would definitely be used by MAD. It would be included among a collection of quotes, considered part of Fay’s vocabulary. I guess that was how it would be. I was heated up by the sentiment. <span id="easy-footnote-4-19830" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-19830" title="T/N: Honestly, I have no idea what MAD our author means here. Perhaps it refers to the Youtube group with the same name?"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Uhn.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>At the next moment, Arthur’s movement became as fast as light.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Fah?!”　</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>Arthur. It was the name that everyone who played the novel game “Round Table Heroes” knew. She was one of the protagonists, which put her on the same level as Tlue. This novel used the Round Table as a hidden main theme where everyone would be equal and could be considered as the protagonist by their own right.　</p>
<p>Of course, that didn’t mean every character involved could have a tremendous amount of plot episodes, so the game treated Arthur and Tlue as the main protagonists, while the other sub-protagonist also existed.　</p>
<p>And, the plots regarding those sub-protagonists were further explored in DLCs, giving further depth to the overall plot.　</p>
<p>Therefore, Sister Maria could be considered both heroine and sub-protagonist. The DLC regarding the story from her perspective had also become the extra fun of this game.　</p>
<p>That was why the game was so popular. And among those characters, the person who held the popularity poll of eternal<strong> second place </strong>was the girl named Arthur.<span id="easy-footnote-1-19831" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-19831" title="T/N: this could either mean he was the 2nd most troll character, or that the 2nd is the actual 1st place since the ranking was made to troll people possibly by placing the most popular character below the most troll character."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>However, this Arthur… was holding a lot of depressing pasts and wasn’t used to communicating with others. Therefore, on the first test known as the entrance exam for the Knights of the Round Table, she was wondering who she could talk to.　</p>
<p><em>What should I do… this should be the place for the enrollment test, right?</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She looked around and confirmed children of similar age were gathering. Arthur was relieved when she eavesdropped on their conversation and found out she was at the right place.　</p>
<p>But she wondered why? The children around her age were laughing happily around. Perhaps they were trying to relieve each other’s tension before the exam. As she saw that, she remembered a little of her sad past. However, she shook her head and switched her thoughts. She found it hard to stay calm in this spot.　</p>
<p><em>Is there any quiet place somewhere…</em>　</p>
<p>At that time, Arthur’s eyes were nailed at a certain spot. There was a single tree nearby. There, a boy folded his arms, leaned against the tree, and quietly closed his eyes.　</p>
<p>He stood there alone… quietly. Arthur felt that the spot alone belonged to a different world. While everyone else was busy talking, that boy was feeling the wind alone.　</p>
<p>Arthur didn’t know why, but she was naturally drawn to that spot. It wasn’t like she had anything to talk about, just feeling the little sunlight leaking through the leaves. The sound from the surrounding area was isolated. Arthur naturally opened her heart due to the situation.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>This person feels mysterious… he feels like a deviant… just like me…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Arthur glanced at a boy she never talked to before. However, the boy noticed her presence when she first glanced at him and their eyes met before he closed his eyes once again.　</p>
<p>The boy was showing his aloofness among all the people around. While everyone was feeling nervous due to the exam and tried to mingle with others, this boy stood there alone. Looking at his figure, Arthur honestly felt the boy was amazing. 　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Amazing… I also wanted the same mental power as him.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>For Arthur, her greatest weakness was that she harbored a fragile mentality. Although Arthur possessed all sorts of talents, she lacked the mental power to use it to the fullest.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>I wonder, how I could become as aloof as him… I want to know his secret.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Arthur wondered what the boy&#8217;s name was. Such a question naturally ran through her mind. Then, the time went on without her managing to talk to him and the paladin who was responsible for the examination appeared. There, the applicants heard the outline of the test which made them lose their tension at once. After all, they were told that they had already passed the exam.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Oh… so it was that simple.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Arthur also had sloppy thoughts at first. But the boy in front of her showed no such sign at all, and his face tightened more than before as he squinted his eyes.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Why? Even though we are told that we already passed the exam…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>That’s right. Let’s use this as a topic to talk to him</em>. Arthur called out to the boy.　</p>
<p>“Hey.”　</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p><em>Did he not hear my voice? Is it because he is so focused that he couldn’t be bothered with anything else? Or I was just ignored?</em>　</p>
<p>“I’m talking with you…”</p>
<p>“You mean me?”</p>
<p>“That’s right… is there anyone else instead of you here?”</p>
<p>“I see… and what of it?”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Err, umm…even though we are already guaranteed to pass the exam and there shouldn’t be any need to focus that much, then why are you so focused that your face tightens and you squint your eyes…? Perhaps that’s too long for a sentence?</em>　</p>
<p><em>I will be thought of as a weirdo if I suddenly ask him with a long sentence. </em>　</p>
<p><em>Err, let’s try to be more concise…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Why do you wear such expressions?”　</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”　</p>
<p><em>Ah, he didn’t get what I meant. I should elaborate on it.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>With that in mind, she gave him a longer explanation this time. The boy then naturally concluded, saying what she asked was an obvious thing.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Why are you asking for obvious things? One can’t grow unless they are always trying to surpass themselves. That’s&nbsp; all to it.”　　</p>
<p><em>…Amazing. To think he always thought that way … but that kind of thinking should be considered heretical. I think he was the same as me, all alone…</em>　</p>
<p><em>Perhaps… if it is with him… we could become friends…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Such a faint feeling arose for a similar person to her. It was a lonely girl (Arthur) and an aloof boy who nobody approached. <span id="easy-footnote-2-19831" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-19831" title="T/N: it’s written as “girl” and read as Arthur. Maybe this kind of things will appear often, just to remind beforehand"><sup>2</sup></a></span>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Even though this person held such noble thoughts, he was still so serious about this… there should be a reason why … ah…</em>　</p>
<p>Then she recalled what the examiner said earlier. Although that man named Marumaru said everyone has already passed the exam, he never said he wouldn’t rank them based on performance.　</p>
<p><em>Amazing, to think this boy managed to reach such a conclusion just from those words…</em>　</p>
<p>Arthur honestly asked the boy whether he noticed that.　</p>
<p>“&#8212;Did you notice such hidden evaluation from the start?”</p>
<p>“…Fuh, obviously.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>He answered as if it was the most obvious thing to do. There was no lie there, or overestimation and underestimation for that matter. The boy truly thought the thing he said was obvious from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps his criteria for success is different from normal people… he wouldn’t accept merely passing. He always treats standards greater than asked for as passing grades.</em></p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>What is his name?</em>　</p><div class="watas-6bde5804600d0e33fe0430fdccdcecfe watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-6bde5804600d0e33fe0430fdccdcecfe"></div>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Fay… that’s a good name…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Is he willing to pair up with me?</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Yay.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Originally, it was supposed to be the exam where main protagonists Tlue and Arthur met each other. Because Arthur, who was all alone, was called out by the cannon fodder Fay, which was then stopped by Tlue.　</p>
<p>Then, Arthur was supposed to be paired with Tlue.　</p>
<p>However, because Tlue was scared of Fay, he didn’t want to approach him. As a result, it created a deviating path where Arthur approached Fay by herself. This would create a big ripple later on.　</p>
<p>This day marks a great turning point.　</p>
<p>And because Tlue didn’t call out to Arthur, it also became the day where Arthur&#8217;s route disappeared from Tlue&#8217;s side of the story.　</p>
