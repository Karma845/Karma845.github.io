<h3>Chapter 8: Turning Abundant Water into Clean Water</h3>


<p class="calibre1">“This is only a symptomatic treatment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma begins the infusion to rehydrate the patient’s  <i class="calibre3">(T/N: the female infant discovered</i> <i class="calibre3">by  Palle)</i>  dehydration.  Falma  provides  the  patient  with  a  simple  oral  rehydration solution. It has been reported that this oral rehydration solution should not be taken in severe cases, Falma judges that the stool has not completely exhausted (in moisture), and therefore the oral rehydration solution method is given in order to get the virus out of the body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is there really only symptomatic treatment? Can’t you do something about it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen asks frustratingly. She wonders if there is any way to increase the probability of survival? Failure is not an option… she screams (inside herself). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh… it depends entirely on her strength and luck. There is no medicine to deal with this virus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma has no further explanation. Further treatment is difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be careful not to allow it to infect us either. This virus is very infectious, Ellen, but my brother  (Palle)  must  be  especially  careful.  If  the  nursing  person  got  infected,  the infection passes from mother to child.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The infection route was fecal-oral infection.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, the infection comes from contaminated food that contains the patient’s excrement  when  it  enters  through  the  mouth.  In  addition,  rotavirus  is  extremely infectious, and even if only a few viruses enter orally, the infection can be transmitted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Great care must be taken to prevent the infected source of excrement from transmitting to the next person. Falma pharmacy  <i class="calibre3">(T/N: it’s deemed as the “sanctuary” by the Great</i> <i class="calibre3">Church)</i>  is  resistant  to  airborne  infections   <i class="calibre3">(T/N:  because  of  Falma’s  purification</i> <i class="calibre3">power)</i>, but relatively less effective against oral infections. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because it is resistant against alcohol, alcohol disinfection does not work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, is that right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen is surprised to know that alcohol is a versatile disinfectant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ellen. Grab the bottle of sodium hypochlorite from the laboratory on the fourth floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll make a disinfectant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, I’ll better wipe all the places Palle touched.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you so much. My brother tells Lotte to change the diapers and bring along this child’s clothes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, leave it to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma uses a proper excuse to drive them out of the quarantine room, and uses his Medicine God’s staff to apply [Relief of the Origin]. He doesn’t want many to witness the magical techniques peculiar to this Medicine God’s staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do your best……” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  will  allow  her  to  regain  her  strength.  Upon  using  the  examination  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Diagnosis Eye], the light turns more bluish purple. The infant’s condition is improving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the temporary treatment has been completed and the disinfection performed, Falma discusses with the staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you for helping me. I’m staying here tonight. I’ll be staying because I don’t want my brother to get infected.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma offers to stay at the pharmacy for nursing. Of the three, only Falma is not infected, so he volunteers as a nurse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will the infection spread if I take her back to the mansion… what I can do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle regrets the situation as he was the one who picked up this abandoned infant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s okay and leave it to me. Both of you, go home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen turns around, with the back of her hair swaying, and leaves the quarantine room </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">and Palle with his wig.  <i class="calibre3">(T/N: author simply indicate she shows the back of her hair, so I</i> <i class="calibre3">emphasise the hair “swaying” part as the author’s intention of a pun)</i> After  they  leave,  Falma  is  thinking  about  another  treatment.  He  thinks  about  the opening of the infant’s divine vein. So Falma gently inserts the tip of the Medicine God’s staff into the infant’s heart, just like how he did with Salomon  <i class="calibre3">(T/N: Solomon’s</i> <i class="calibre3">divine vein was sealed by the Great Church earlier). The baby is asleep and does not seem</i> <i class="calibre3">to be uncomfortable (from the staff piercing towards the heart)</i>. A pale light leaks from the tip of the staff. Then, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll help you, Falma-kun” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen, who should have left, returns and suddenly opens the quarantine room’s door., just as Falma stabs into the infant’s chest with the tip of the staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Woah!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma hurriedly pulled out the Medicine God’s staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What were you trying to do with that child?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how one looks at it, it only looks like he was trying to do harm to the infant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I’m not doing anything wrong. This is a misunderstanding.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are doing to a sick child? You’re trying to use the infant for an experiment for somekind of medicine!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen pulls out her staff, perhaps assuming the worst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you think I would do that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think you’re going to do such thing, but what are you doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, I’ll confess. I was trying to open the infant’s divine vein.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What the hell…?” Ellen utters a weak voice mutters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If the guardian god can’t judge the divine vein, the connection will not open. You can’t do it properly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think it’s already open.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen is flabbergasted. Falma opens the infant’s divine vein during this critical state because he is convinced that the infant’s immunity will increase when divine power increases. This is certain as the aristocrats are more immune than the commoners. He wonders if the symptoms can be prevented from becoming more serious with the help of the [Relief of the Origin] power and using the protection of the infant’s newly released divine power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This isn’t a lie? Is the infant’s divine vein  <i class="calibre3">(T/N: author uses “heart”)</i> open?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Ellen takes out the divine power meter from the bag and brings it closer to the infant, the gauge touches. The infant registers a very strong divine power. It was zero when she measured the infant earlier, but there is a clear change… </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When did you manage to do such a thing since the priests couldn’t even open the connections? I didn’t even hear the cast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I can see this infant’s divine vein. My way has no chanting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The priest could not have opened it, but Falma reassures that he has done it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wonder if this infant has an odd attribute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway, I wish I can pick the infant up again. May I have Salomon do the assessment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This order of things is messed up. It’s normal y after the appraisal that the priest opens the divine vein.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Haha… sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That night, Falma stays with Ellen at the pharmacy and they take turns taking care of the female infant while eating a simple meal during their breaks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will take a bath, so please do not come in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen goes into the bath, she uses her Divine Art to produce clean water by herself and takes a bath. Falma hurriedly rushes to Ellen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t enter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma thinks to himself while listening to the sound of Ellen’s bath, while he’s in the presence of a little girl who is recovering little by little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I wonder if there were many children who died because of the rotavirus… I think it wouldn’t have been so severe without any rotavirus vaccine) The vaccines are a viable preventative measure that can be taken in the Saint Fleuve Empire, which currently lacks clean water and sewage systems. These areas are the main reasons for infectious diseases’ frequently outbreaks due to insufficient sanitation of water supply and sewage facilities (vaccine… and then water). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The aristocrats are in environments where they are not soaked with unsanitary water, and considering the commoners, Falma cannot leave it alone. It takes a lot of effort to cure each il ness. The pharmacist’s power may not be able to deal with them al . Diseases that lack therapeutic methods, such as rotavirus, are not uncommon. Then, if one gets sick, one must not only only cure it but also prevent to the best that one can. Falma believes so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm… Why don’t Falma also take a bath and be refreshed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, Ellen. Let’s use purified water instead of normal water.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While holding the infant girl in his arms, she begins to cry, as Falma speaks familiarly with Ellen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s wrong? Not surprisingly, we aren’t water Divine Art users?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen is fluffy and steamed after the bath, and wipes her silky and supple silver hair with a towel. Her cheeks looked glossy to Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But the commoners are not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can buy clean water, if you have money. It’s not that expensive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen’s sense of money is exactly like the Countess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not if it’s us. For some people, it’s too expensive to afford clean water. One can buy drinking water but not domestic (portable) water. We may have to do something about the  standards.  Everyone  needs  clean  water,  not  only  aristocrats.  It’s  not  for  the (standards  of  living  for  the)  commoners,  but  it’s  to  save  their  lives  and  prevent </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">infectious diseases.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It takes a huge budget and many years to build a water supply for each household. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if the Empire can construct the water supply, it is difficult to immediately supply clean water to the entire Empire. However, even the Divine Art of water magicians cannot provide enough clean water to supply for daily life, including the commoners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the contrary, the entire Saint Fleuve Empire is a water-rich empire. They draw water from the river and use it in each household. There is also a public water fetching area. There is enough water. But the water sources are muddy and not really clean and or safe. One cannot drink it directly unless one boils it, and if one washes their face and body, once will get an infection. In addition, domestic water flows back to the San Fleuve River. As a result, it is the cause for the increase in both infant and the infectious disease mortalities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the reincarnation of Falma into the San Fleuve Empire, an increase of sanctuary areas has occurred around him, so the water from the river facing his mansion and in the center of the city has been relatively purified. However, the dire situation is the same when it is a little out of the district (away from the pharmacy) along the river and the center of the Imperial City, located beyond the residence of the Medicis family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if there are outbreaks of these sanctuaries throughout the imperial capital, they cannot be maintained indefinitely. When Falma leaves this world, it’s going to end up where  it  started   <i class="calibre3">(T/N:  just  like  before  Falma’s  arrival.  Pretty  bad  shape  from  this</i> <i class="calibre3">descriptor). </i> People will suffer from the plague. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Water is the source of life. Let’s make clean water available to everyone.” </p>


<p class="calibre1">Falma believes that it’s a practical measure, where water purification facilities should be built throughout the empire and the idea of clean public water draws in foreign countries  (to  follow  the  example).  It  is  difficult  to  construct  a  large-scale  water purification facility. Therefore, a filter membrane can be used to save space, as the bacteria and viruses can be eliminated. The filtration membrane can be produced by a chemical method. They wil  inform the (magical) technicians  <i class="calibre3">(T/N: magical engineers?)</i> about the filtration method and maintain the technology so that the water quality can be maintained. That is a reliable and consistent way to eliminate diseases. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want the (unsanitary) water to infect the public and kill the people anywhere in the world. At the same time, we want to be able to prevent diseases with vaccines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It will take years, decades. But I want to start now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a lofty plan that cannot be compared to the past, with other countries in mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think your idea is always impossible for humans.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen said in a hurry, stating what’s on her mind. Ellen feels that the world is improving a little more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next day, the infant girl who has the divine vein opened begins to recover. At the Different World Pharmacy, for a while, there is a strange sight that Falma and Ellen are serving customers with a baby on their backs. Ellen’s parents’ home, the Bonnefoy family, adopted the infant girl who satisfies the qualities of a noble family  <i class="calibre3">(T/N: the</i> <i class="calibre3">ability to use Divine Art), </i> and named her Sophie. There is no longer a vestige of the prior abandonment. If she’s dressed up and wel  groomed, she wil  be transformed into a brilliant daughter. Ellen’s father, Count Bonnefoy, is delighted to adopt Sophie, since Ellen was an only child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result of being evaluated by Solomon at a later date, her attribute is deemed to be rare  in  the  world  as  she  has  four  attributes  beyond  the  common  public,  and  her guardian deity is Raijin (God of Lightning). Her divine power is converted into electricity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a while, Sophie goes to the pharmacy with Ellen to see if there is a sequela  <i class="calibre3">(T/N:</i> <i class="calibre3">consequences as conditions result from prior diseases/injuries)</i> of rotavirus. Every time Sophie gets excited at the pharmacy, Falma, who was taking care of her, is electrocuted with a weak electrical current. For some reason, she prefers Falma to get an electric shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen! Sophie, stop with electric shock! Stop!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma, who is treating Sophie, screams during his break at the pharmacy. It seems that she has a habit of sending out electric shocks when her emotions are excited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sophie, stay calm!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen is also a target to get an electric shock while trying to appease Sophie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cha-kii!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sophie, who innocently shoots an electric shock, is also playing with Falma. It seems </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">funny as Falma and Ellen scream as they play with Sophie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lotte, call Celeste from below for me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello! I’m here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma gives Sophie to Celeste after calling for her, who is a mother and a pharmacist with many children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, yes, it’s easy to put them to sleep. Sophie-sama, it’s my turn ~ Let’s sing a song ~” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time, Celste sing a lullaby, and Sophie fell asleep instantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Falma-sama, you haven’t screamed that much lately. You’re stil  being zapped by electric shocks, right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few more days later, Lotte asks the frightened Falma. As usual, he and Sophie are together, as Sophie sits on Falma’s lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, it’s a bit crazy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma, who seems not to be phased like before where one can see the white of his eyes, finally makes a remark about his metamorphosis to the electric shocks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve gradually gotten used to it, Falma-kun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t low frequency current good for treating back pain in patients who come to a pharmacy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, how should I deal with that face of yours?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen is confused by the stunned face of the shop owner, who isn’t exposed to the customers.  <i class="calibre3"> (T/N: Yep, those TENS machine at max level can do that to you. I got one myself)</i> </p>
