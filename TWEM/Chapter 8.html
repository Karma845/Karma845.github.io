<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; Establishment of the Trading Company</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—Two weeks later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I came back from shopping and opened the front door to find&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““Welcome back. Master.”””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than twenty servants lined up on both sides of the hallway, bowing their heads and welcoming me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past two weeks, I&#8217;ve hired fifteen maids and five butlers. All of them were in their teens or twenties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were the ones I had chosen at the slave trader’s market, and they seemed to be excellent both as servants and employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for everything, and keep up the good work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The servants raised their heads in unison, and one of the women at the front spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What a waste of words. I would like to train even harder for master&#8217;s sake!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the servants&#8217; faces broke into a smile and they thanked me in unison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t work too hard, okay.&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-19192249' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-19192249' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I was trying to tell them to take care of themselves and take it easy&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you talking about? We have vowed to devote our entire bodies and soul to Master Haruto for the rest of our lives. So, there’s nothing more to say right!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to devote your entire lives to little ol’ me. You all need to think about your future as well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why the maids are so loyal to me to this extent goes back to two weeks ago—the day after I returned to this mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to head to Bohbee&#8217;s store, the slave trader who led me to meet Ephyr, to buy some slaves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne and Kusel tagged along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr, Iris, Asha, Tendo and his five-man party heroes stayed back, saying that they were not pysched about going to some slave trader’s shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We parked the carriage in the back of the store and entered the store, and immediately a man who seemed like the shopkeeper approached us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Welcome. How may I help you today? I can assure you that if it involves these two, then our offer surely won’t disappoint—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man gave a sarcastic smile, but directed a condescending gaze at Finne and Kusel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time that Finne and Kusel raised their eyebrows, I directed a mild intimidation at the fool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, what the hell were you about to say about my friends?&#8221;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered if he thought I was here to sell them or something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my sharp gaze, the man lets out a small “hieek” scream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he immediately opened his mouth as if to make amends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“M-My apologies, sir! But I didn&#8217;t mean to—&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then what were you meaning to do? Just get the owner of the store out of here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have no business with him but Bohbee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told him to call Bohbee before he started spewing unnecessary things again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man ran to the back of the store, flurrying as if to escape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a long wait, Bohbee came out of the back room, mumbling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For fuck’s sake. Where is this daredevil that is bold enough to cause trouble&#8230;whoa, Master Haruto? What a pleasant surprise, It sure has been a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Long time no see, Bohbee.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee came out complaining about God knows what he must have been told, but his attitude suddenly changed when he saw me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What can I do for you this time?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s him, he’s the one! He threatened me—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Would you shut the fuck shut up! Do you have any idea who you’re referring to!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh, how do you mean&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shopkeeper appealed to Bohbee, but he was rebuffed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is Master Haruto, an EX-rank adventurer! Don&#8217;t you know anything about that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;EX rank?! You mean this runt?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nerve on this guy, calling me a runt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, by the way, weren’t you setting up price tags on my friends just now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“S-Setting up price tags&#8230;I, I did no such&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee&#8217;s eyes widened at my comment, then turned to the shopkeeper and shouted with a bright red face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What were you doing to our valuable customers? If you drive our customers away, can you take responsibility for it?! You know what, you’re fired!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“P-Please, anything but that!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Get the hell out! Don&#8217;t you ever show your face in front of me again!!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-25239317' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-25239317' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No please!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Somebody get him out of here! He’s fired! Do not allow him inside the store again!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee called in someone else and had the shopkeeper&#8230;or rather the former shopkeeper, removed from the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked at me as if he wanted me to help me out, but there was no way I was gonna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He dared to put a price on my precious friend and fiancée. If he had said something worse, he wouldn&#8217;t have been able to keep his life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At any rate, I was glad to see that both Finne and Kusel looked refreshed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee turned to me and lowered his head to ask.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Master Haruto. What can I do for you this time?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right. I&#8217;ve decided to open a store and I&#8217;m looking for people to work there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh really. And what is this store?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee reacted when he heard the word, store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, simply put, it&#8217;s a general* store.” (TLN: Jack of all trades)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I see. May I ask you about the merchandise later?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, sir. So you&#8217;re looking for someone with good sales skills, I take it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the idea. Oh, and you don’t have to worry about whether or not they have any physical defects this time as well, just show me what you got.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked at me strangely for a moment, but then nodded in agreement, perhaps remembering that I had asked him with the same conditions the last time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we were shown to the reception room, and when I was settled, Bohbee asked me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I&#8217;d like to ask you, what happened to the one you bought before?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus came the well justified question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm, he looks a little confused&#8230;well, I don’t mind telling him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You want to know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By all means!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I healed that elf of all her injuries.”</span></p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee’s eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you look at that, such good reaction, sheesh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I deepened my smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You better believe it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But without the legendary elixir, that feat would have been&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Come on now, who do you think I am?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee stared at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Certainly, as an EX rank adventurer, you must have some methods that I can’t even begin to imagine. Any chance you could perhaps teach me one or two, my good sir&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me see&#8230;If I taught it to just anyone, then it’ll definitely get me into a lot of trouble&#8230;Bohbee, on the other hand seems to be a good guy, taking care of those unfortunate slaves who have nowhere else to go, making sure that they don’t become yet another batch of commodities. I guess I can trust him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure. Just don&#8217;t tell anyone about it, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That goes without saying!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, I wonder why this guy is in the slave trade business. I think he has the kind of personality that would make him successful as a regular merchant&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suddenly wondered about it, so I asked him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why I operate a slave trade&#8230;you ask? Well, because slaves sell so well and at fairly high prices, I guess. In fact, I also sell horses and houses in another business, and this slave trade is one of the businesses with huge turnover in sales&#8230;there’s also the fact that I can’t ignore those who are in unfortunate circumstances alone, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee may have started out with a bad tone, but I think he meant what he said at the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He&#8217;s got the personality of a man without conceit and the talent of a businessman&#8230;this is the kind of person I want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Bohbee. Would you like to help me out in my store?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked, Bohbee showed a slight sign of consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can I really be of assistance? I mean, depending on the product of course, I don&#8217;t think I can help you much&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmmm, I guess I didn’t give him enough information to get hooked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made sure that there were no other employees around before continuing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Between you and me, we&#8217;re going to be making some tools and quality potions that only we know about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Only Master Haruto and the others know about it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can&#8217;t tell you anymore than that unless you swear to keep your mouth shut with contract magic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contract magic is a spell that allows you to make a contract on mutually agreed upon terms, and penalize you when violate it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee thought about it for a moment, but he quickly agreed.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-27809481' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-27809481' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I understand, I’m in!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay, then, I will now use the contract magic.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I immediately cast the spell on Bohbee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spell was to make it impossible for him to tell anyone but my friends about the information he was going to obtain when I talked about the product—in other words, about my personal life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I finished casting the spell, the binding contract would have appeared in his mind, which is probably why Bohbee looked surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Master Haruto’s personal life story&#8230;is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, well, don&#8217;t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just to be sure, I erected a soundproof barrier around the room so that no sound would leak out before I started talking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it would be pain to tell him everything, so I told him that I was summoned together with the heroes, but turned out I wasn’t a hero, and that I&#8217;m trying to develop products using ideas and technology from my original world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I see, that sounds promising. I understand. I will join the trading company that Master Haruto is establishing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He nodded very easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although I invited you, are you going to be all right? What are you going to do about this store and your other businesses?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t need to worry. I&#8217;ve trained my apprentices to be ready for any situation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh wow, it’s all good then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, thank you. Speaking of which&#8230;when will you be joining us? I&#8217;m planning to launch in about a month.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh right&#8230;how about three weeks from now? I also need to find a replacement to take over this store.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, no problem. I guess I&#8217;ll see you in three weeks then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I held out my hand and Bohbee shook it back firmly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m looking forward to working with you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s my pleasure. I&#8217;m looking forward to your performance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind us, Finne muttered faintly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Haruto. You haven&#8217;t forgotten your original objective, have you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then checked the status of the slaves Bohbee had introduced to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, the people I wanted were well chosen, so I went ahead and purchased them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, since they were few in numbers, I decided to check the status of each slave in the trading company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way, we found a couple with a very frightened looking daughter of about 10 years old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were no physical defects, but she had wounds all over her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon using appraisal, it seems that the father is Benak, the mother is Hatra, and the daughter is named Hayna, and that they are not nobles in particular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What about them? What’s their story?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well&#8230;it seems that they were assaulted at the previous slaver&#8217;s place, as some sort of sick method of relieving stress&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, so in other words you couldn&#8217;t stand the sight and bought them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can they read, write, or perform calculations?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Apparently only the daughter can&#8217;t yet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm. Then I guess I&#8217;ll just have to educate her myself, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Then I&#8217;ll buy these three as well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you very much!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them stared with their eyes wide open as it was decided that they will be bought right in front of them.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-87119056' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-87119056' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walked up to the three of them sitting on the floor, crouched down and spoke to them at the same eye level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nice to meet you. I&#8217;m Haruto, an adventurer, and I’ve just decided to buy the three of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, the couple freaked out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They probably thought that they would be used as decoys after hearing the word adventurer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Rest assured. I won’t treat you badly. You have my word.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple looked relieved at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, next.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we continued checking one after another, and finally I went into the last remaining room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a room where slaves with severe deficiencies are gathered, so it would be very stimulating for Finne, not to mention Kusel, who used to be a knight. Therefore, only Bohbee and I entered into the room, and I asked them to wait in another room with the parents and child as well as the other slaves I had decided to buy up to this point, a total of thirteen people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the room, it seems that there has been a fair amount of turnover since the last time I was here&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bohbee, what if I told you I could cure all of their defects?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That would be&#8230;certainly possible, if it came from master Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just so you know, it ain’t gonna be free.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee thought about it for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;As much as I would like to do so, it is hard to imagine there been profit to be made selling them after they’ve been healed&#8230;although I feel very bad for them, I am going to have to decline.&#8221;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see, fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it&#8217;s just an idea, and definitely not something I can force.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I looked around the room again, and as a result, decided to buy seven more of out them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all either had etiquette, combat skills or experience in customer service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of them had been falsely accused or set up by unscrupulous merchants and sold into slavery, and had been forced to participate in slave gladiatorial fights or abused in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since they are in this room, they have some physical defects and are weak, but with Bohbee&#8217;s help, we carefully carried them to the carriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, we decided to rent another carriage and returned to the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bohbee, you’ve been of great help. Like I said, I will contact you on a later date, in which case, I’ll be relying on you henceforth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Master Haruto, no, boss! Understood sir!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boss, huh? Doesn’t sound half bad coming from Bohbee, I must say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Bohbee bowing to us, we left the slaver trader’s shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arriving at the mansion, I called out to Sebas, Lyla, and Mia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sorry guys. Could you carry the physically impaired and lay them on the bed?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the three of them were carrying the slaves, Tendo noticed that I had returned and came over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Welcome back&#8230;wow, you really went all out with your shopping.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo said this to me in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is true that just excluding the ones with defects alone, it still leaves me with thirteen people after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what, although the mansion is also a factor, there’s no such thing as the trading company having too much manpower.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I guess so.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, I turned around facing the thirteen slaves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well then, I will give you a brief description of the job&#8230;or so I’d like to say, but there are others who were purchased separately from you guys, so I would do the explanation all together with them later. Until then, you can&#8230;let’s see umm, there&#8217;s a cafeteria, so why don&#8217;t you take a break there? Tendo, please show them the way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo nodded honestly and took the slaves with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now then, I should go to the remaining seven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved to the room where Sebas and the others carried the slaves and checked on the seven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First, I will begin with recovering their superficial injuries and strength, and then&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I recovered the slaves to the extent where only their physical defects remain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Bohbee had informed me about their circumstances, there may be some among them who are falsifying their information and, more importantly, some of them may not want to recover from their defects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cast a recovery spell, and the seven woke up immediately.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-12774178' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-12774178' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPScyJyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8aW5zIGNsYXNzPSJhZHNieWdvb2dsZSIKICAgICBzdHlsZT0iZGlzcGxheTpibG9jazsgdGV4dC1hbGlnbjpjZW50ZXI7IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtbGF5b3V0PSJpbi1hcnRpY2xlIgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtZm9ybWF0PSJmbHVpZCIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWNsaWVudD0iY2EtcHViLTY2MDk0NDIzMzgwODAxMTYiCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1zbG90PSI0NjU2ODgwMzY4Ij48L2lucz4KPHNjcmlwdD4KICAgICAoYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgPSB3aW5kb3cuYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgfHwgW10pLnB1c2goe30pOwo8L3NjcmlwdD4=' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Where is this&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After briefly explaining the situation to the seven who woke up, I asked Sebas to call the other slaves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as the seven who had been staring blankly at their situation were finally calming down, the other slaves came rushing into the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, I once again introduced myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My name is Haruto. I have purchased you all to become servants of this mansion or employees of the trading company I am about to establish.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slaves were buzzing at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of all this, one woman, still on the bed, raised her remaining right arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am grateful to you, Master Haruto, for healing my injuries. But to work as a servant or employee with a body like this, with no left arm and no right leg, is&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can resolve that. I can heal such physical defects.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the slaves widened their eyes at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Either as servants or employees, if you work for me, I will pay you a small salary, and you can even buy back your freedom when you have saved up enough money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, a few of their eyes lit up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I continued speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And the seven on the bed over there. You have been blamed for your sins, or tricked, and have fallen into slavery&#8230;isn’t that right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging from their reactions, it seems that the information was correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But how do you think that happened? Why didn&#8217;t you deny your guilt?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman earlier answered my question woefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Because I lacked power.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman in the bed next to her continued to speak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s right. I didn&#8217;t resist in the face of such a powerful force and simply accepted it as a matter of course. I stopped resisting, not even thinking about the hell that would follow&#8230;it seems like a miracle that I am still alive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At these words, everyone turned their heads down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked around at all these slaves and said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re right, you shouldn&#8217;t have given up. You should have resisted desperately. You should have kept your will strong, even if you lacked the strength——but, while it’s easy to say all that, reality is not so kind. Resistance would most likely not have changed the outcome, and in the end, nothing can be done without power. That power could be physical combat power, knowledge, or anything else. It is something that becomes your weapon of choice. To fight, you have to have a strong will and at the same time, strength.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I broke off my speech here and took a breath before continuing.<br><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22545" src="https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SpeechHaruto.jpg?resize=1009%2C1481&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1009" height="1481" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SpeechHaruto.jpg?w=1009&amp;ssl=1 1009w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SpeechHaruto.jpg?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SpeechHaruto.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 698w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SpeechHaruto.jpg?resize=768%2C1127&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SpeechHaruto.jpg?resize=660%2C969&amp;ssl=1 660w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SpeechHaruto.jpg?resize=66%2C96&amp;ssl=1 66w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then——do you long for power?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo, who was near the entrance of the room, had a facial expression as if saying “Really, you&#8217;re really going with that line?”, but I ignored him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I can actually give them power&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right, Ellis?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Yes, it is possible. If you imbue mana into them and get them to learn how to manipulate it properly, they will manifest their latent skills.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right, I intend to empower them in this way and train servants and employees who will be an asset in terms of combat capability.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want them to be able to live on their own even after they eventually become free. Of course, I intend to educate them well so that they do not become arrogant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slaves stared at me as I thought about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the woman from earlier opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To heal my wounds as well as grant me power&#8230;can you really, do these things?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then grant me that power. I beseech you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand. And the others?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked around, and one of the ones I had purchased from Bohbee’s recommendation opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I remember correctly, she too, had fallen into slavery after being set up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too, I beg of you. I don&#8217;t want to go through that frustration again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all nodded vigorously in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I first completely healed the seven with the physical defects, and then I poured magic power into all of them and taught them how to handle it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slaves were surprised when their defects were healed, but they were even more surprised when I channeled my magic power to them, and moreover, when they saw that their skills had blossomed, they seemed to be at a loss for words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, even I, who gave them magic power, was surprised to see that many of them learned more powerful skills and magic than I had expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I had finished empowering them, I tried to explain to them again about the subsequent objectives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now then, let&#8217;s go over the work to be done, the assignments, and what I want you to do——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I looked at them ready to get right into it, all twenty of them were on their knees with their heads hanging down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gee, you all don&#8217;t have to be so formal&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh come on, what the heck, just be at ease and listen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said this, one of them opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No can’t do sir. Anything less is simply unacceptable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I am saying it’s unnecessary, sheesh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We hereby pledge our lives and loyalty to you for the rest of our lives, until the end of our days. It is the least we can do for our master who performed such god-like miracles and saved us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas and the others who were watching nodded in satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What? Isn’t that a little extreme?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was thinking that, Finne, perhaps reading it from my expression, gave me a glare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto. That is not a feat that you can just dismiss as something trivial, is it? I will have you know that even if we exhaust all our mana, we wouldn’t even come close, just so you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, that&#8217;s how it is&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, since they mean no harm, so I guess I might as well just give in&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, I&#8217;ll accept your gestures. But you have to be mindful of your surroundings in case there are guests or customers present, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““Yes sir!”””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, on the other hand, not feeling so good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">——So, I have more servants now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s all good that they pledged their loyalty to me, but&#8230;it’s a little overwhelming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I let out a small sigh and called out to Sebas and the others who were nearby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Welcome back. Sebastian, Lyla and Mia. How&#8217;s their education going?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right. It&#8217;s going quite well. As expected of the people chosen by Master Haruto, they are steadily absorbing what we teach them one after the other. It will still take some time before they complete their education, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. Thank you. How long do you think it will take?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Sebastian, and when I turned to him, Lyla took over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will explain. Let me start by saying that they are about 70% through basic education.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow, so fast.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, they were selected by Master Haruto after all!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. After the basics, there will be education on management and other topics. It will take at least two more weeks to complete their education.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmmm, it seemed rather protracted and at the same time kinda brief. Well, it&#8217;s pretty fast-paced, though, that’s for sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. Well, then, let&#8217;s try to finish the preparations for the launch of the trading company by then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, sir. By the way, His Majesty reached out while you were away Master Haruto, and said that everything was ready and that you could begin inspection today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow, already? Damn, I would expect nothing less.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After our last discussion, we somehow found and decided upon a suitable location for the store, and he also agreed to find a suitable accommodation for the employees and land to manufacture our products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I&#8217;ll go down there and check it out right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll briefly watch Tendo and the others practice in the yard, then go check out the prospective location for the store, and then finally head to Bohbee’s place, I’ll leave the rest to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With my back turned to Sebas, who bowed his head, I headed for the backyard.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
