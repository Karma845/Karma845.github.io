<h2>Chapter 8 &#8211; Ilmina and the Satanic Cult</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, Ilmina woke up in the basement of the building Haruto and his party were targeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Where, am I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She uttered as if she was trying to remember.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I remember, Cardinal Alben telling me to wait for him, and then someone came into the room——oh my god!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she noticed the chains wrapped around her hands and feet to restrain her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unable to get out of them, she tried to break the chains with magic, but&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;W-Why, why can’t I use magic?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina became puzzled and impatient when she failed to invoke magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever she tried to channel magic power, it immediately fizzled out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then a certain magic tool came to her mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is this, an anti-magic chain&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ‘anti-magic chain’ is a tool that interferes with the concentration of magic power of those who touch it, making it impossible to invoke magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s considered difficult to obtain because it is dangerous depending on how it is used, but there it was, binding Ilmina’s hands and feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when she tried to get out of it forcefully, the chains only made a clattering sound and did not budge at all.</span></p><div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She managed to get up and check her surroundings, but couldn’t find anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she suddenly noticed that there was something red written all over the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;A magic, circle?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large magic circle spread across the entire floor of the room, emitting a pale red light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, she noticed that something was sipping out of her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it, sucking my life force and strength out of my body&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then it dawned on her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of magic circle is this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of the recent turmoil, could this be——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Devil-summoning* magic circle?&nbsp; Even so, one of this magnitude must be pretty high in rank, perhaps higher, the highest-ranking devil&#8230;?” (TLN: Prev. tld as “Demons”, now changed to “Devils”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this were to summon the highest-ranking devil, the holy city won’t remain unscathed. It would even be considered lucky if it got partially destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To foil this summoning, I need to get out of here. But if I force myself and end up dying in the process, it will only hasten the summoning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ilmina was pondering this, she heard the door open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She turned her head at the sound and caught a figure dressed in black vestments entering the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina glared at him, thinking that he’s probably the mastermind behind the whole thing.</span></p><div class="no-visibility-check ai-check-2-50949068" data-insertion-position="after" data-selector=".ai-check-2-50949068" data-code="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" data-block="2"><span class="ai-check-block ai-cfp" data-ai-block="2" data-ai-cfp-time="1"></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see you’re awake, Lady Saint?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she could not see clearly through the hood, she recognized the voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just recently——no. She heard it just before she fainted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cardinal, Alben&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s right, Lady Ilmina.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben took off his hood in front of Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her face was enveloped in deep astonishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben, whom they had trusted to investigate the series of incidents, turned out to be the ringleader behind them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why! Why are you doing this, Cardinal Alben!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben answered with a sinister smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why? Because I’m originally a devil worshiper and a member of the cult that is behind the current turmoil, the Satanic Cult.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Please tell me this is some kind of joke, an upright individual like you, a devil worshiper&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have always been one though? Well, to be precise, since I was eighteen years old. Betrayed by the someone I cared about, my parents were killed, and I despised god. Why do I have to suffer such a fate&#8230;you know? Well, the one who betrayed me was later killed by a knight anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina could not offer any word of comfort.</span></p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had been raised as a saint and felt that anything she said would be meaningless to him who hated god.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s when I started worshiping the devil.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was Alben&#8217;s past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But still, still, god——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What, can he help me? Save me? Or bring the dead back to life?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, that’s what I thought! A god who can’t be bothered and only observes from his high and mighty seat. If so, wouldn’t you say that the devil, who can fulfill my wishes if I offer him a price, is more deserving of my worship&#8230;doesn’t that sound more worthy to be called a god?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina couldn’t say anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“S-Still&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh shut the fuck up.&nbsp; Just keep your little bitchass mouth quiet——okay!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kyaa&#8230;C-Cardinal, AlBen?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina exhaled and at the same time felt a scorching heat in her abdomen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking down, she saw a knife in Alben&#8217;s hand and a fresh wound with blood pouring out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina’s blood trickled down to the ground and touched the magic circle——and the moment it did, the magic circle became more radiant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eek! W-Why, why are you&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm. Will this much be enough? There are other sacrifices besides you, but after all, your blood makes the magic circle glow stronger&#8230;but hey, don’t you worry. We won’t kill you.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True to his word, Alben intends to keep Ilmina alive so that they can use her blood regularly to summon devils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina’s face twitched as she realized this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then she heard an explosion from outside the room and felt the building shake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s going on?! Have they found us already?! That can’t be, it&#8217;s way too soon!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying this, Alben rushed out of the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait&#8230;has help, arrived?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina held on to her fading consciousness and wondered who, if anyone, had come to her rescue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The go-to conclusion would be the Holy Knights, but the sound of the explosion from earlier must have been from a magic of considerable power. No one in the Holy Knights wields such powerful magic&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After thinking about it, a certain individual came to her mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fiance of her friend Princess Iris of the Kingdom of Perdis and the world&#8217;s most powerful adventurer——Haruto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But, how&#8230;come?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina tried to figure out why Haruto would come to rescue her, but no answer came to mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, five individuals were seated around a round table in one of the rooms in the building. A subordinate, who had come to report on the explosion outside, informed them that the surrounding guards had been wiped out and that the Holy Knights were beginning to assemble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that moment, one of them raised his voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you going to do about this? We couldn&#8217;t have been found out so quickly! The fact that they did is your damn fault!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The others chimed in, expressing their agreement, but Alben fired back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I followed the plan as agreed, damn it! And none of you objected to it. Besides, the plan hasn&#8217;t failed yet, has it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan was in motion and Alben would be damned if it were to crumble now. Despite his insistence, the others refused to heed his words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rest of us will be leaving here first. You claimed you’d take responsibility for failure. You haven&#8217;t forgotten, surely?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Of course not.” Alben nodded bitterly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So long then—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other four rose to depart and as one of them was about to say, &#8220;let&#8217;s get out of here,&#8221; Alben stopped them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is it? Anything else?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The plan has failed, hasn&#8217;t it?” another questioned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Besides, the strongest holy knight is right on our doorstep,” the third chimed in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Exactly. We can&#8217;t confront them”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four men discussed the plan’s apparent failure and the impossibility of facing such odds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben, however, shook his head in disagreement.</span></p><div class="no-visibility-check ai-check-9-45935500" data-insertion-position="after" data-selector=".ai-check-9-45935500" data-code="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" data-block="9"><span class="ai-check-block ai-cfp" data-ai-block="9" data-ai-cfp-time="1"></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From what I saw earlier, there’s no doubt the summoning is at hand. Judging by the intensity of the light, I&#8217;m fairly certain it&#8217;s the highest-rank devil.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben&#8217;s comment brought those who were leaving to a halt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unbelievable!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the four men&#8217;s faces were beaming with joy, Alben, unbeknownst to them, was also smiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, but we lack the required offering.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sacrifice? Isn’t that the saint’s purpose?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben replied to the question. “Not quite. She&#8217;s merely a catalyst. A small amount of blood from the saint is more than sufficient. Without more sacrifices, the devil won’t manifest for long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, do we use the Holy Knights who are gathering?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, that’s too dangerous. I thought something like this might happen, so I prepared for this eventuality.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Recall the cage above the saint&#8217;s chamber holding those whom we kidnapped? In addition to them, I’ve also gathered volunteers for the sacrificed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was true. Alongside those they had kidnapped, there were some members of the Satanic Cult who volunteered to to be sacrificed to the devil, and if they were included, the number totaled twenty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, the four grinned maliciously, and Alben continued speaking.</span></p><div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We haven’t much time, and judging by the magic circle&#8217;s glow, we need only deposit the sacrifices, recite the incantation, and the devil shall appear. Since we can always use the saint again, we must evacuate her first. You lot must aid in the summoning ritual, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he told them of the plan, they all nodded with sinister smiles on their faces and said, “Certainly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Alben and the other four, along with several subordinates, entered the basement, Ilmina glared at them as she saw them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, how frightening. A saint shouldn’t make such a scary face.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Alben spoke mockingly, her scowl deepened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And whose to blame for that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hearing you say that really hurts my feelings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina was seething with anger, but there was nothing she could do about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Alben spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve collected enough of your blood. All that remains to be done is to bring the sacrifices here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Alben gave the order, the ceiling opened and a cage descended from above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina’s eyes widened at the sudden turn of events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What! What is this?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You understand, don&#8217;t you? These are the sacrifices&#8230; the victims of the recent disappearances.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you believe it’s okay to do something like this?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course I do. It’s all for the fulfillment of our long-awaited desire.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other four laughed in agreement with Alben&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Release them right now!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina demanded, but Alben ignored her plea and instead issued an order to his subordinates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Remove her from this room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Alben&#8217;s command, the cult members seized Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, let go of me! Release those people immediately!” she protested, but with a wound in the abdomen, and her strength sapped by the magic circle, she couldn&#8217;t resist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her screams echoed through the chamber, to no avail.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as they heard her plaintive cry, the caged sacrifices were unresponsive, their vacant eyes staring into the void.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What have you done to them?” Ilmina cried out, noticing something was off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben replied nonchalantly, “We simply used magic on them to make them more submissive, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—What?!” Ilmina gasped, her shock stunning her into silence as she was dragged out of the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was promptly locked in another cell-like chamber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no means of escape, all she could do was pray and trust that someone would intervene in this horrific situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in the ritual chamber, Alben was giving orders to his subordinates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Get them out of the cage and gather them to the center of the magic circle.”</span></p><div class="no-visibility-check ai-check-2-74442573" data-insertion-position="after" data-selector=".ai-check-2-74442573" data-code="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" data-block="2"><span class="ai-check-block ai-cfp" data-ai-block="2" data-ai-cfp-time="1"></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cult members opened the cage, and the sacrifices came out in droves with blank, lifeless eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At last.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our long-awaited wish will finally be realized&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now we can summon the devil.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finally&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four twisted their mouths as they said this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, let&#8217;s begin. The stage has been set. Position yourselves at the head of the formation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben&#8217;s words were the signal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who had emerged from the cage gathered in the center of the magic circle, and Alben and the other members of the cult surrounded them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raising both palms, Alben and his associates began reciting an incantation. After several minutes of rhythmic chanting, Alben&#8217;s voice crescendoed: &#8220;Summon Devil&#8217;s Gate!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the words rang out, the magical circle&#8217;s luminescence intensified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those in the center of the magic circle collapsed to the floor, their souls wrenched from their bodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The light of the magic circle converged to the center producing a billowing black mist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mist coalesced into a pillar roughly one meter in diameter, extending to the ceiling and soon a figure materialized from within.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben and his fellow cultists shouted with joy at the sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At last, finally, we have succeeded!” they cried in unison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, as if in response to their shouts, the shadowy figure in the mist spoke out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufuu, mere humans dare to summon me&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, the mist cleared away and the devil was revealed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stood clad in refined black aristocratic garb, his medium gray hair contrasting with his onyx eyes. His most striking features were the bat-like wings unfurling from his back, the black horns jutting from his brow, and his slightly pointed ears.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the devil looked around, Alben opened his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hear our wishes, O devil!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The devil chuckled. “Very well, speak.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben broke out in smiles upon hearing those words and then announced the cult&#8217;s wishes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Raze this holy city to the ground!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure. But still, it’s my first time in the mundane world in a very long time. With this many sacrifices, I would say I have about two days at most. If I use my abilities, perhaps a single day. No matter, I shall use you all to compensate for any shortcomings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing his words, the cultists paled and tried to flee in terror. However, they were swiftly ensnared by ebony chains conjured from the shadows, binding them in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s the meaning of this?! L-Let go of me! ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take this thing off me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are not a part of this!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right, we’re not supposed to take part in this!”</span></p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are the summoners!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben and the others were screaming their heads off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the devil distorted its mouth in amusement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufuu, then you’d be wrong. Because you are. Since you dared to give orders to me. The sacrifice is merely the price for the summoning. But to get me to do your bidding that’s another story. You don’t honestly think that you get to order me around without paying a price? You’re not going to say that it didn’t occur to you, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A black, ominous aura overflowed from the devil’s entire body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hie, hieeek!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben and the others, their faces contorted with fear, could not even move their bodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, I’ll be taking your souls now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-Wait—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After those words from Alben, no one else in the room was capable of moving except for the devil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufufuu, it’s still not enough. But I will grant your wishes. My word is my bond after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying this, the devil then tried detecting those in the vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were several reactions, but then the devil shouted in delight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Look at that, there are still quite a few around. One weakened woman and—?! Oh my, what do we have here? To think that I’d find a decent human in this place, should be fun. But first, let me fulfill my promise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With those words, the devil disappeared from the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇ ◇ ◇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, Haruto, was heading to the basement where I had picked up Ilmina’s presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilizing my stealth and concealment skills, I discreetly eliminated any cult members I encountered along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I approached the basement, I halted upon spotting two guards stationed outside the room where I had detected Ilmina&#8217;s presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed that several people were gathered in another room, likely the location where they were preparing to summon the devil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, since the mana coming from that room didn’t seem to be particularly alarming and Ilmina’s reaction was weakening, I decided to head toward Ilmina first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quickly advancing towards the two guards, I summoned a surge of lightning magic. The crackling energy coursed through them, instantly incapacitating the pair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps noticing the sound of the two men falling, I heard Ilmina’s voice coming from behind the iron door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is someone-is someone there?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s me, Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my response, Ilmina exclaimed in disbelief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haru&#8230;to?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hang on, I&#8217;ll get you out of here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No! You have to stop the summoning, quickly!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you mean?”</span></p><div class="no-visibility-check ai-check-4-11172407" data-insertion-position="after" data-selector=".ai-check-4-11172407" data-code="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" data-block="4"><span class="ai-check-block ai-cfp" data-ai-block="4" data-ai-cfp-time="1"></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment I placed my hand on the door, I froze. I knew the group I sensed earlier was preparing to summon the devil, but I hadn&#8217;t suspected they&#8217;d already finished their preparations!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The devil summoning&#8230; we have to stop them immediately!” Ilmina pleaded desperately. But, having come this far, I couldn&#8217;t just leave her by herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh, hold on, let me get you out first!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried opening the door, but it seemed to be locked and wouldn&#8217;t budge.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I clicked my tongue and thought, &#8220;Damn, what a waste of time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I swiftly activated my molding skill to unlock the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind the now-open door, Ilmina was there, weakened and chained to the wall. To make matters worse, blood oozed from a wound in her abdomen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I rushed over to her and unleashed a wind spell to break the chains on her limbs, but it was easily repelled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the hell?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was puzzled seeing my magic repelled, and Ilmina explained to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an anti-magic chain. Magic attacks won’t work on it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since magic didn&#8217;t work, I tried using my skills instead. I invoked molding and successfully unlinked the chains. As expected, these chains seemed to dissipate any mana channeled into them. I placed them into my dimensional storage for the time being; they appeared to be valuable research material.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I immediately supported Ilmina, who appeared weak, with both hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you so much&#8230; but why are you here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can talk later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no time to explain, so I cast a healing spell on Ilmina. A pale light enveloped her, mending the wound in her abdomen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“R-Recovery magic&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She appeared genuinely surprised, likely not expecting me to use healing magic. However, I needed information from her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just explain the situation to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-Okay!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that she had recovered, Ilmina was able to speak clearly and described the current situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—And that’s about it. Now hurry up and stop the summoning! Don&#8217;t worry about me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hadn&#8217;t anticipated they&#8217;d finish summoning the devil this fast&#8230; What a huge screw-up. Just as I was about to bolt back to the room I noticed earlier, a powerful and ominous surge of mana suddenly appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Seems we were just a second too late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina sensed it as well. Her face drained of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh no, no&#8230; my god&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m afraid it’s as you feared. Looks like we didn&#8217;t make it in time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was fuming inside, cursing myself for not being able to stop the summoning. But dwelling on it wouldn&#8217;t change the situation. My main priority was to get Ilmina to a safe location— the cathedral.</span></p>
