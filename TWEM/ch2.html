<h1>Chapter 2: A Walk Under The Cold Sky</h1>

<div class="text-left">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the night after my secret audience with Her Royal Highness. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sky through the window was clear, with countless stars twinkling on a black backdrop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was staring at the night sky while lying on a sofa inside my office. I had a tea snack on my desk and a blanket covering my torso. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t think I can call this an office anymore.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I often stayed in this room—it was more comfortable than home—so these supplies were a necessity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What? Work, you say? Tomorrow’s share was already done</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> At the moment, I had nothing to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What should I do…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was completely free.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Why don’t I find something to do that isn’t related to work?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I had already read every textbook in the office, and if I tried to help a colleague, I’d end up on the receiving end of Milena-san’s fist… Huh. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I shouldn’t overwork. </span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, telling myself that wouldn’t get rid of my free time. I wasn’t sleepy, and I wasn’t hungry. If that was the case…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…I think I’ll go for a walk.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The physical activity would hopefully tire me out, and it would kill most of my spare time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I donned the robe that hung on the wall, put my rapier around my waist, and left the office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There I encountered Milena-san, who had just finished her work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, a walk?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I don’t have anything to do right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You could get a head start on tomorrow’s work…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Already finished it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…I have no words.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Milena-san cracked her neck and left the room, suppressing a yawn. She was probably on her way to the lounge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moments later, I found myself walking down a hallway in the royal palace. The light of the full moon shone through the window, illuminating the dark passageway brighter than the candlelight did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled my collar close and exhaled, and the air turned white for a moment before dissipating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Spring had just begun, but the air was still cold at this time of year… rather, it was just always cold. My hands were sensitive to this kind of weather. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Why didn’t I bring any gloves with me…</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m glad I brought tea.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I removed my flask from my pocket—one with a heat-retaining charm—and brought it to my mouth. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Apologies for drinking while walking, but you’ll have to forgive me.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> It was just too cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel the warmth spread in my abdomen after passing through my throat. It was an extremely pleasant sensation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t have a destination in mind, but there were only a limited number of places to go in this palace. A library full of books. A dining hall. Neither was open right now, but I had no business in either place to begin with. So there was really only one option.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to the garden.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the only place where I could enjoy a walk. The faint scent of osmanthus permeated through the air, and a variety of other flowers were in full bloom under the moonlight. The fountain’s surface clearly reflected the moon. The gentle trickling of water and pleasant floral scent relaxed me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was where I would often go when I had too much time on my hands. I came here during lunch; for small breaks; on a night walk. In a way, I was very fond of this place. It was a comfortable environment, and the rest of the royal palace just wasn’t as pleasant an area to walk at night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was the type to prefer a countryside surrounded by nature, with relatively few people, over a bustling city. I didn’t like places with crowds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat on the bench and gazed at the water streaming from the fountain. The surface was white from the moonlight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here, I could almost forget the flow of time. It was the perfect place to idle about. The only problem was the cold. I couldn’t stay without a hot drink. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s possible to use magic to keep your internal temperature warm, but if you keep doing it, you could run out of mana to use in an emergency. I usually tried not to rely too much on magic. My old master taught me this principle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, my robe helped me endure the cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lost in thought while listening to the gentle trickling of water, I felt a drowsiness creep up on me. This was what I wanted, right? I felt like I was going to fall asleep on the spot…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hold on, I… if I sleep here… I’ll die.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Contrary to my words, my eyelids gradually fluttered shut. My vision turned dark, and the sound of water became distant. Alone under the cold sky, while sitting on a bench in the gardens at night… maybe it wouldn’t be too bad. I’ll just sleep here. The temperature would probably be the same in the morning as it was now. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this thought in my heart, I quickly drifted off into sleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…nn……yes…”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">How long have I been asleep?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I woke up to the sound of a faint voice next to me. A beautiful voice, transparent as bell chimes, that sounded quite familiar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened my eyes, my vision was hazy. Immediately I shuddered, as if remembering the cold that my body had forgotten. This is what happens when you sleep outside on a chilly night… Be careful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Princess?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“—Huh!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Illuminated by the moon, the beautiful princess let out a surprised yelp. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face was next to my own.</span></p>
