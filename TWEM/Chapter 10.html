<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; Noir&#8217;s Past</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I used to do the dirty work in the Black Ops Division of the Kingdom of Glicente, under the direct control of His Majesty the King. Officially, I was a member of the intelligence agency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her to report directly to the king, then she must be among the elite of the elites. Coupled with the fact that she had quite a number of skills, so she must have been pretty good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Black Ops division was mainly concerned with political maneuvering and the assassination of those who were inconvenient for the monarchy. One day, we, the Black Ops Division, received a royal edict from His Majesty. The order was the abduction of the princess of the Elven village.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Abduction of an elf princess?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir nodded quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At that time, there was an operation to raid the elven village in the Sea of Trees and enslave them. With that as a smokescreen, the agents from the Black Ops division secretly abducted the elf princess and tried to get her to divulge information about other elven villages and use her as a bargaining chip. A team was assembled within the Black Ops division with me as the leader of the operation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing her talk about the abduction of the elven princess of the Sea of Trees, I raised my eyebrows. She’s talking about Ephyr.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-62125415' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-62125415' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember Ephyr actually telling me that she was caught by the soldiers when she was trying to escape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To be honest, it didn’t sit well with me. I tried raising an objection, but I was but a tool of the Black Ops division, a tool of the king, and the king’s orders are absolute. The chain of command was different from that of the knights and soldiers who were the main force of the raid, and since they had not been briefed about the capture of the elf princess, they might end up killing her. So, in order to secure her safe custody, we blended in with the soldiers, keeping our identities hidden.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir took a break at this point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the elven village, which we had so invaded, fierce battles ensued. In the midst of all this, we, the Black Ops divided into two groups, narrowed down the route along which the princess was likely to escape, and kept watch with the other soldiers&#8230;ultimately, the princess appeared on the route where I was not, and just as they were about to capture her, they were counterattacked.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then Noir frowned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, Ephyr also mentioned this part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The signal came just as they found her, and I headed to the spot. But what I saw getting there was a group of fellow Black ops members and soldiers lying on the ground. And the only surviving soldier was about to kill the princess in a fit of rage. I managed to stop the soldier, but the princess was in a very bad shape. The situation wasn’t looking good, so I contacted His Majesty, but he said, ‘If she is that battered and bruised, she’ll probably die soon. Might as well sell her off to a slave trader’&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So you sold her to a slave trader.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir nodded at my words.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see. It fits in perfectly with Ephyr’s account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we returned to the castle after the mission, we were met with criticism. The king must have been annoyed that we could not capture the elf princess as planned. In addition, as the one who headed the operation, I was held responsible for the deaths of several valuable personnel in the Black Ops dividion and was kicked out of the division&#8230; and I would have been killed immediately too, but I was tortured for the amusement of the princes. Then, perhaps they thought they could make some money off me before I bit the dust, they sold me off to a slave trader sticking me with some random crime.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir snickered after saying all that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess they thought I was going to die anyway with no hope of recovery, but&#8230;in the end, I survived and here I am. Even though I had been kicked out of Glicente, I insisted on only talking to you because it was something that could very well cause a lot of resentment if a large number of people heard it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, now I see your point.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew the royal family of Glicente was rotten to the core.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only now, I would like to clarify my doubts after hearing what she just said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Don’t you hold any resentment towards the royal family of Glicente?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right. I didn&#8217;t feel any hatred from her at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s the point? It&#8217;s true that I screwed up at work, and as for being enslaved and branded a criminal, even if I resented and resisted, my opponent was an entire nation, I never stood a chance&#8230;besides, that very royal family is gone now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir smiled weakly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she looked me in the eye and asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hearing that, do you still want to buy me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. I want you. I&#8217;m in the process of establishing a trading company, and I&#8217;m wondering if your intelligence skills might come in handy. And I also have no problem with your personality.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; What if I betray you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well then. I guess that will just mean that I’m not as good a judge of character as I think.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, I carried on.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-78868966' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-78868966' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can make you much stronger than you have ever been. Right now, you are at the mercy of such injustice, but you will be able to overcome it if you gain strength. What do you think? Wouldn&#8217;t you like to have the strength to overcome all difficulties and to carry out your will?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I held out my right hand to Noir.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir hesitated for a moment, but immediately took my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I desire the strength to carry out my will. For that purpose, I will be at your disposal&#8230;but can you really, really make me stronger?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s up to you, Noir. But you won&#8217;t regret it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“&#8230;All right. I pledge my allegiance to you for the rest of my life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir changed her language, fell to her knees and bowed her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a warrior who had chosen a master to serve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded and acknowledged it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Master Haruto, please forgive me for my earlier transgressions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry about it. Well then, welcome Noir. You are eventually going to become one of the strong. And from now on, I look forward to you working as my shadow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took Noir&#8217;s hand again and pulled her up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But perhaps because of her wounds, Noir wobbled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Please excuse me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come on, don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, I dissolved the barrier spell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see you’ve finished your discussion, boss. So, has it been decided then?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The barrier I erected was only to block out sound, so he would have been able to see everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you even have to ask?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well. You had such a merry expression on your face after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Maybe because of the place being what it is, somehow, the smile seemed like a wicked one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, so, how much?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me see—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I paid Bohbee and got the slave contract done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir was still unable to move on her own, so I picked her up and carried her to the carriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;However, when I got back to the carriage, I was met with stares from Finne and the others who were waiting back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was as if they were saying, “You&#8217;ve gone and pick up another girl uh&#8230;”, so I had to give an explanation in a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I managed to convince them, and after getting into the carriage, I called out to Bohbee who had come to see me off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well then, I&#8217;ll be looking forward to your arrival after you’re done with the handover. If you need anything at all, please come to my mansion, okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, with Bohbee bowing his head, we set out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, we were going to head straight for the royal castle, but&#8230;I was not comfortable taking Noir in her battered condition with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought about putting her inside the subspace, but I’ll need someone to watch over and stay with her, and it would also be troublesome if she got curious and for explanation of the skill, so I decided to head straight back home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After returning to the mansion without any hiccup, I was greeted by the maids and Sebas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““““Welcome back.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Welcome back, Master Haruto. You are back earlier than scheduled&#8230;and who might that be?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas turned to Noir, whom I was carrying in my arms, and asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m back. I just stopped by Bohbee’s for a minute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh I see. That’s how it is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas narrowed his eyes and nodded approvingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m going to cure her, so please assist her with a bath afterwards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took Noir into an empty room and placed her on the bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Noir. I&#8217;m going to cure the missing parts now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Y-Yes sir.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir was surprised, but nodded obediently. By channeling my mana together with recovery magic, Noir&#8217;s body was enveloped in light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the light subsided, her missing arm returned, and the cuts and bruises all over her body were nowhere to be found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir looked as if she couldn&#8217;t believe it, and touched her entire body as if to check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she turned her head toward me and gave me a big smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dear Master Haruto&#8230;Thank you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t sweat it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now all that’s left is to have her take a bath&#8230;but before that, there&#8217;s something I need to let her know.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Noir. There is something you should know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir looked me in the eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The elf princess whom you attacked is in this house. Her name is Ephyr. I bought her at the slave trader’s shop a while ago.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise as I continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Would you like to meet her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder how she will respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she doesn’t want to meet her, it would be better not to force her to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All I have to do is make sure that I don’t mention anything about Noir to Ephyr and avoid them running into each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s what I was thinking, but Noir&#8217;s answer was not so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Oh, oh I see. Then, please let me meet her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir said, looking me straight in the eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—I want to apologize.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, okay. But I also need to hear how Ephyr feels, so you can go take a bath in the meantime&#8230;Sebas, please see to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas opened the door with impeccable timing and I left the rest to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes sir. I will call you when she’s done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Noir. I need you to go with Sebas.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Noir nod, Sebas turned on his heel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, your name is Noir. This way please. Lyla, I need two maids who are available immediately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then gave instructions to Lyla, who was behind the door, and then took Noir with him to the bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Okay then, time to go see Ephyr.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard a voice and turned toward the entrance, where I found Finne standing there with a worried look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Finne?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Umm, will Ephyr&#8230;will she be all right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I guess she was worried about Ephyr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll be fine. She may appear like that, but Ephyr is quite strong, just so you know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I really hope so&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne still seems concerned, but we will never know unless we actually talk to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took Finne with me and headed for Ephyr’s room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr should be in her room at this hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s me. May I come in?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto? Please come in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prompted by Ephyr’s voice from inside, I opened the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see you’ve returned, what&#8217;s going on?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know this is sudden, but I wanted to ask you something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I explained to Ephyr about Noir.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Ephyr nodded with a mysterious look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I see&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So as for what I wanted to ask&#8230;are you willing to meet Noir? Since she’s my slave, you’ll probably run into one another. But If you don&#8217;t want to, I can make arrangements so that you don’t run into each other.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said this, Ephyr shook her head.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-74602767' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-74602767' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean. I don&#8217;t even remember what anyone did to me after I passed out, and I believe this Noir person was just following the king&#8217;s orders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. Besides, for Haruto to bring this person along, it means she’s not really a bad person, isn’t that right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course&#8230;speaking of which, for a long time now I’ve been putting off freeing Ephyr from slavery, but today seems like a good time as any so, what do you say?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At these words, Ephyr’s body jumped and she looked up at me with a troubled expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uh-ho? That wasn’t the reaction I was expecting&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Umm, what will become of me if I become emancipated?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, does she perhaps think that she&#8217;s going to be kicked out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well you just go on about your business as usual, right? I mean, even as a slave, I didn’t particularly restrict your actions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr tilted her head. I guess she is thinking about what to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, after a while, she looked at me seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, then, I&#8217;d like to have the slave crest removed&#8230;instead, may I make a request?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm? What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y-Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr’s cheeks turned slightly red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I, uh, I like you, Haruto. And, I hope we can stay together forever&#8230;so, please make me your fiancée!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as she said that, Ephyr went all, &#8220;Ugh&#8230;&#8230;I said it&#8221;, and her face turned bright red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was somewhat aware of Ephyr’s feelings, but&#8230;I didn&#8217;t expect her to say that at this point in time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I see. Thanks. In that case, please take care of me from now on, Ephyr.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes! Likewise!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded, and Ephyr let out a big smile.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, after a long wait while talking with Ephyr, Sebas knocked on the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Master Haruto, sorry for keeping you waiting. I have brought Noir as requested.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you, come on in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The door opened and Sebas and Noir came inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir looked different from when I met her at the slaver trader’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her black hair, which had been shaggy, was now trimmed and shiny, and her skin was now translucent white. She had become very beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You look different.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for everything you&#8217;ve done for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir then quickly bowed deeply expressing her gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come on now. The purpose of your visit this time isn’t me—but rather her, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put my hands on Ephyr’s back and pulled her forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr’s shoulders were trembling, as if she was recalling what had happened in the village, or perhaps she was nervous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reassure Ephyr, I pat her on the head gently to calm her down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After her trembling subsided, Ephyr smiled and murmured, “Thank you”, and turned to Noir with a serious expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir looked at Ephyr and bowed deeply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Indeed, you are the elf princess at that time&#8230;I am truly, truly sorry! Of course, I don&#8217;t expect to be forgiven just for apologizing. If you want my life, I will give it up gladly, with your permission of course, Master Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing those words, Ephyr looked at me puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an earnest apology from Noir, but you’ll have to decide what to do, Ephyr. I also won’t intervene. So, do as your heart moves you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She nodded deeply at my words and turned to Noir again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Please raise your head. I would like to ask you something, all I remember about that day is the part where that soldier hit me&#8230;I think I would have died if the incident had run its course, but you were the one who patched me up, weren&#8217;t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir looked up and answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I was the one who patched you up.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-13405965' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-13405965' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I see&#8230;thank you. Thanks to you I’ve stayed alive till this day, it’s absurd to think that I would ask you to pay for that grace with your life&#8230;umm, well, Noir, did you kill any of my people&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I swear I did not. My mission was to secure you, so I took very little part in the actual battle&#8230;but then again, that&#8217;s just an excuse when in fact, I was on the invading force.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Noir is saying must be true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, Ephyr breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, thank you. I understand that when you serve your country, there are some things that are beyond your control or defy. On top of that, not only did you not lay a hand on my people, you even saved my life&#8230;how could I possibly think of punishing you after all these.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir quietly stared at Ephyr. Tears welling in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you, are you really going to forgive me&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s there to forgive, instead I would like to express my gratitude to you. I hope you look on me kindly as Haruto’s colleagues from now on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr smiled gently and reached her hand to Noir.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir took her hand and said with tears streaming down her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you very much. I intend to devote my whole heart and soul to Master Haruto from now on. So, I am the one who hopes you look on her kindly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll be counting on you. And please do treat your life more carefully as much as you can&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, of course. However, I have no intention of showing mercy to those who target Master Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh, I think that&#8217;s fine&#8230;so, once again, I hereby welcome you to the fold.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Ephyr smiled at her, Noir also smiled for the first time since entering the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that Noir seemed to decide to learn to work as a maid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason, she said, was “I would like to be useful to Master Haruto even when I am not engaged in espionage activities”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has become friends with everyone in the mansion, and her smiles are beginning to appear frequently, albeit gradually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess that settles the matter for now.</span></p>
