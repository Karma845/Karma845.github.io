<h2>Chapter 10 &#8211; The Decisive Battle Against the Highest-Ranking Devil</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, Haruto, carrying Ilmina, decided to leave the building where she was being held captive and head for the cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, I had to carry her in my arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she was so embarrassed that her face turned bright red and she was in a frenzy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“P-Please put, put me down!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-Hey, quit struggling! Or you’re going to fall off!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just put me down! I-I can’t be seen, like this&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“J-Just bear with it! We need to hurry!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know! I know that, but still! U-Ughh~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina covered her bright red face with her hands again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt a little sorry for her and almost stopped, but I shook off the thought when I heard the sound of an explosion behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This explosion was caused by the battle between Zero and the devil, as far as I could tell from the map.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But still, how could that devil be evenly matched with Zero&#8230;or rather, it’s looking like the devil has the upper hand?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was honestly surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero should be stronger than back when he fought me in the labyrinth. And yet he’s on his back foot&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I glanced back and appraised the devil.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll be damned, he’s way too OP&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what’s up with that unique skill?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name alone is giving me the chills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><b>&lt;The Fool&#8217;s Precept&gt;</b></p>
<p><b>The user can construct barriers at will and absorb the souls of those who have died within them.</b></p>
<p><b>Basic physical abilities and the strength of magic attacks increase according to souls absorbed.</b></p>
<p><b>Also, the user can weaken other people at will within the barrier.</b></p>
<p><b>Only within the barrier, the user can perform magic at will, unrestricted by attributes.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This skill is even more powerful than I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A barrier that weakens the enemy with just a thought is as overpowered as it gets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did confirm that the barrier has been activated and also felt the strength in my body drop a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides that, every skill level is at 10, which is the maximum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the ‘Destroyer of Nations’ bit in his title. I don&#8217;t know what the requirements are to earn this title, but if he has literally destroyed a country, whenever that may be, it shows that he has that much capability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks like even I may have a hard time against him&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that on my mind, I picked up the pace all of a sudden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kyaaaaaaaaaah!? T-That’s too fast! A-Also, are we flying through the air right now? We’re actually flying!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t think she was going to overreact in this manner from just flying for a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just bear with it. The holy city is in crisis right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know that! But I can’t help being scared!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After running for a while with Ilmina’s screams as background music, the cathedral came into view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the large garden of the cathedral, we could see people who had apparently taken refuge there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, with such a loud battle racket that’s been going on for so long, it’s probably the right decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we landed in the garden of the cathedral, we were met with many stares.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, they looked at my face, which suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and then at Ilmina, who was being carried like a princess in my arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was so embarrassed that her face became so flushed and she looked up at me and said, “Please put me down quickly&#8230;”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This situation is even more embarrassing than I thought it would be&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought, but since Ilmina’s reaction was kinda amusing, I went straight to the entrance of the cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holy knights standing guard by the door pointed their swords at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who are you! Why is the saint with you? When she’s supposed to be missing!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hold on——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Call for backup! We found the culprit who abducted the saint!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he said that, the holy knights who were in the back of the cathedral and in the garden rushed over and surrounded me and Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey fuckface, how do you figure&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people who had taken refuge were also gathering around to see what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, this situation feels like deja vu&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh right! It&#8217;s just like that time with Iris.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh? What about Iris——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina tilted her head in confusion at the sudden mention of Iris&#8217;s name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her flushed face was now back to normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if her embarrassment was blown away by the sudden turn of events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, perhaps irritated by my carefree attitude, the holy knight shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let go of the saint at once! What a ludicrous manner of carrying someone!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oops, I was still holding her in my arms like a princess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps remembering this, Ilmina’s face became flushed again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“P-Please put me down! I, I can&#8217;t continue to be seen like this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hate to say it, but you’ve already been seen plenty——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just put me down already!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey quit struggling! I&#8217;ll put you down! I&#8217;ll put you down!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You mongrel! How dare you do that to the saint!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holy knights were raising their voices, but will you all please just shut up for fuck’s sake?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I finally lowered the rampaging Ilmina to the ground after being hit and slapped in the face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You could have just done this sooner&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do it now! Rescue the saint!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait a min——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Engage—!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holy knights came running toward us with weapons in their hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And since I’m not exactly keen on offering my head due to a misunderstanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I jumped back from the spot, holding Ilmina in my arms again so she wouldn’t get hurt, because even if the holy knights didn’t intend to, one never knows what might happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Ilmina, who found herself in my arms again, began to scream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, kyaaaah!? W-What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you mean! Can’t you see these guys are totally lost in their misunderstanding, if I had just left you there, there’s a very big chance you might get hurt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, um&#8230;you’re right. Thank you&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At any rate, I landed and put Ilmina down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You mongreeeel!&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you dare run away!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the red-faced holy knight shouted that, the door behind them opened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one who came out of the door was Liebert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s with all the ruckus?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Holiness! We are about to arrest the culprit who abducted the saint! It could get dangerous, so please stand back!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The culprit&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert looked at me and then at Ilmina next to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Ilmina!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Father!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina rushed over and hugged Liebert, who was equally happy to see her again and hugged her back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then came one dumb holy knight who doesn’t know how to read the mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now is our chance! Seize him!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert then shouted in haste to stop the holy knights who had begun moving to capture me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hold it right there!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the sound of his voice, the holy knights stopped moving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you stopping us, Your Holiness! This man is——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please calm down and examine the situation very carefully. Besides, it’s not good to be judgmental and turn deaf ears to what the other person has to say.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these words, the holy knights became silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making sure that the holy knights have calmed down, Liebert introduced me to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This gentleman is Haruto, an adventurer. I personally enlisted his help to rescue Ilmina.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s exactly as father said. That man is the benefactor who saved me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So that’s how it is&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert and Ilmina nodded in affirmation to the holy knight&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they affirmed so and I said, “That&#8217;s right”, the holy knights quickly put their swords away and bowed deeply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our sincerest apologies! All because of my hasty judgment! When I heard that lady saint was kidnapped, I just&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holy knight, whose face was bright red until a moment ago, bowed deeply as a representative of the group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought of this at the time with Iris as well, that knights and soldiers in this world are very loyal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Or maybe, it just shows how much these people are adored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you ask me if it would be the same in the former Glicente Kingdom, I highly doubt it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry about it. It just shows how much you care for both Ilmina and Liebert’s well-being.&nbsp; I forgive you, so please raise your head.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Oh, just like that? Even though we attacked you with our swords.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I could easily avoid attacks of that level so it’s no problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, these people were just trying to accomplish their mission, so it can&#8217;t be helped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s all good, really, so you all should raise your heads up since I get where y’all coming from. With the situation being what it is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying that much, the holy knights finally raised their heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people who had gathered were at first surprised that the saint had been kidnapped, but they were overjoyed to see her return safe and sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for letting the holy knights off the hook.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please accept my thanks too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert and Ilmina bowed to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure thing.&nbsp; That aside&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at the barrier that had been deployed throughout the holy city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The others around us also looked up at the sky anxiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the occasional sound of battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I heard it too on our way coming here, but what is that exactly&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I answered Ilmina’s question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It sounds like Zero and the devil are fighting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Zero&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, my butler who came with me. He seems to have weakened quite a bit because of this barrier, but I somehow feel like he’s stalling for time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he had transformed into a dragon which is his original form, he should be able to regain some of his strength and gain an advantage, but it appears that he’s refraining from doing so in order not to escalate the confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, he can&#8217;t win the battle in his human form, so it looks like he’s trying to buy time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s probably waiting for me to come back after getting Ilmina to safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I can&#8217;t just go back without explaining the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, Ilmina, and Liebert went to a room in the cathedral and shared information——about the true masterminds, as well as the current situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh my god, Cardinal Alben, and those cultists&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert was quite shocked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have no idea who he was, but he must have trusted him very much, I bet?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What kind of person was he?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He was a kind-hearted man who served me for a long time, and after losing his wife and children, he treated orphans and the poor without discrimination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere became awkward, and Ilmina tried to change the subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the way, where is the Captain of the Holy Knights?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I checked with my skills and it seems that he is currently evacuating the people from the city. At first he wanted to try fighting the devil, but he was no match for him, so he left him to Zero and headed that way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is this devil really that powerful?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert&#8217;s eyes widened when he heard that even the most powerful holy knight in the country was no match for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was about to explain about the devil, there was a loud sound, booom! Something came crashing into the building, breaking down the walls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-What is going on?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert raised his voice and stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing the sound, the holy knights also gathered and took positions to protect Liebert and Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I looked toward the object that had crashed into the building, there was Zero, in a pretty bad shape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His butler&#8217;s uniform was gone, and a large amount of blood was flowing from his abdomen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing that it was Zero, I rushed over to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you all right, Zero?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My apologies, Master Haruto, catching me in such an ungainly state&#8230;that devil is quite a tricky opponent. If not for the barrier, I would have wiped the floor with him&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Zero said that, I heard a very amused voice out of nowhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufufuu, what do you mean by tricky? Please come entertain me some more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a steady thump of footsteps, a handsome man with horns on his head and bat-like wings on his back appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;It&#8217;s you, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might as well be rhetorical, because I could tell with just his presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That the one in front of me was in fact——the devil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nice to meet you. You may call me Schwartz.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The devil introduced himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How utterly presumptuous, a vile devil giving out his name!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the holy knights shouted and drew his sword, and the other holy knights followed his lead and attacked Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have no business with you lot——Darkness Line!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz waved his hand to one side, and a ray of darkness ran through the path. A beat later, the upper and lower bodies of the knights were cut in two and collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the collapsed wall, some of the people in the garden seemed to have seen the whole thing and screamed. Panic ensued as the people tried to escape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of all this, something white floated up from the bodies of the holy knights and flowed to Schwartz, and was absorbed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm. The quality is not bad. Very tasty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Schwartz, who was licking his tongue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that just now, their souls&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right. Pure souls and, conversely, souls filled with negative emotions are of high quality. They are quite essential for us to function in the mundane world, you see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz explained proudly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does he mean by the mundane world?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was wondering, I received an explanation from Ellis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;The ‘mundane world’ is the world where master is currently in. There are other worlds known as the ‘Demon Realm’ and the ‘Heavenly Realm’. The ‘Demon Realm’ is where demons live, and in the ‘Heavenly Realm’ is where god, who manage this world, and his servants, the angels, live.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, I&#8217;ve met god before, but didn’t know there are angels as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was busy being impressed, Schwartz continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, who might you be, with such overwhelming presence and magic power?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz asked with a hint of caution in his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since he already introduced himself, I may as well do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am Haruto. An adventurer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto. I’ll keep it in mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, how kind of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz and I were staring at each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, suddenly, a voice called out to me from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto! That devil is very strong!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned to look in the direction of the voice to find Gawain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kufufufuu, if it isn’t the one who narrowly escaped death a while ago. I spared you, and now you’ve come back&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying this, Schwartz turned to me, as if he had lost interest in him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned my gaze back to Schwartz as I replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh believe me, I’m well aware of that. Even though he was weakened, he still did quite a number on Zero. It would have been a different story if it weren&#8217;t for that pesky unique skill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was implicitly telling Schwartz that I can see his status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Schwartz narrowed his eyes and opened his mouth curiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto. You are pretty pesky yourself, you know&#8230;when I first appeared in this world, I thought you could be a threat, but how could I have known you were this much of a bad news. How the hell did you raise your level to 300?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Schwartz can see the fake status I created with my Disguise skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My actual level is over 400.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s a secret. Besides, do you think I&#8217;d bother to tell that to a mere devil that will soon perish?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A mere devil, huh&#8230;I may look like this, but I am actually a Demon Lord of the Highest-Ranking Devil, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time Schwartz said these words, the pressure he was exuding increased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone except me and Zero turned pale and trembled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, Gawain seemed to be enduring as well. He must have experienced the pressure once before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“D-Did he just say, Demon Lord&#8230;?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert uttered with a face filled with despair, as were the faces of the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s all over&#8230;no one can possibly defeat him&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone muttered, Ilmina elaborated in a trembling voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Demon Lord&#8230;a legendary-class devil that is said to have destroyed many countries in the past. An existence that is said to surpass even the Demon King&#8230;how are we supposed to go against an opponent that even the hero of the long past could not defeat&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz reacted to the word ‘hero’ in Ilmina’s sentence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh yeah, the hero. I have fought him before and he wasn’t that strong. His level was only 250, so he was a little weak. It’s such a shame that he ran away during the fight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A level 250 is weak&#8230;? Who can defeat the devil freak&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one replied to Liebert&#8217;s words. The holy knights fell on their butts and seemed to have given up even trying to escape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why do you all look like it&#8217;s the end of the world?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My words echoed throughout the surrounding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina looked up at me standing right in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aren’t you going to ask me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked at me with a shocked expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess she remembered who I am and what everyone calls me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——If we ask you, Haruto, will you accept it?! In this situation where we have nothing to give you as a reward!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;It seems they think I&#8217;m someone who won&#8217;t move without a reward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My delicate heart was a little hurt. Just a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have more than enough money and I don&#8217;t need a territory. So, I have no need for a reward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re thinking about a reward, I don&#8217;t need——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-That’s right! For the reward, how about me? All of me, as a whole, will be staked as the reward!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before I could finish, Ilmina said something outrageous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert, Gawain, and the other knights were staring at her with expressions as if saying, “What the hell are you talking about?!”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was truly glad that Finne and the others were not here to see this. If they had been there, I would have been sent to hell by now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, no, that&#8217;s not a very good idea&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it not good enough?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I patted her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s going on?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Listen Ilmina. Iris asked me to save her dear friend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She listened quietly, and I continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t need a reward. Since it’s a request from my fiancee.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-Okay&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina’s face became flushed and she turned her head down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then instructed Zero, Gawain, and the holy knights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Zero, Gawain, and the holy knights are to protect the people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it. Forgive me, Master Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re going to face that devil, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, just leave him to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said that and stared at Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was staring back at me too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good~. Do your best to defeat me——Darkness Line!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz waved his arm and unleashed the magic he had used just now on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s probably planning to kill Liebert and Ilmina who were right behind me in one go should things go his way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not gonna happen——Aegis!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz&#8217;s attack was easily blocked by the barrier I deployed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can forget about breaking this barrier.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kufufufuu, looks like this is going to be fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz smiled broadly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s too cramped here. What do you say, we change location? I’m sure that would be convenient for you too, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;What are you playing at?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz&#8217;s suggestion aroused my suspicion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh don&#8217;t worry. I just thought that unless I defeat you, I won&#8217;t be able to kill these people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You bet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufufuu, follow me then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Schwartz disappeared in an instant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His presence appeared above the cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was about to head over as well, Ilmina grabbed me by the sleeve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh, please save us all, and the holy city.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I smiled and left the cathedral to join Schwartz.</span></p>
