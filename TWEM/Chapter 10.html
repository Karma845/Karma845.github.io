<h3>Chapter 10: The Truth of Hermes's Alchemy</h3>



<p class="calibre1">The day has come for the planned alchemist gathering. After finishing the day’s work and completely closing the pharmacy to attend the gathering, El en disguises herself using  a  man’s  outfit  and  presents  her  transformation  in  front  of  the  staff  as  she previously announced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah — Eleonor-sama, you look wonderful! A very handsome young man. It’s so cool!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte praises her innocently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright. Why don’t you take a picture of us, Lotte-chan.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes! I’ll take a lot!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen wears her boots up to her knees, dons a long cloak, and uses a tricorne as the final touch. Her appearance is a handsome young man with long hair under his hat, pince-nez, with a rugged beard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma wears a simple disguise, and the two start to pose for a photograph session. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">Didn’t Ellen just want to experiment with cosplay? She looks way too good. </i>) Her dignitary image of a noble stands out, but that’s just Falma’s impression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey hey, I’m looking forward to working with you today.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door of the pharmacy opens, and an old gentleman appears before them, entering into the place without prior notice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who is that?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha ha ha, it is me.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre wears glasses and has a gray wig. He’s also in disguise. At a glance, we didn’t </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">recognize him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eh, they’ve all done all this for Falma?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte eyes widen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t feel motivated by Falma’s simple disguise.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen makes a bitter face. Aside from everyone else’s elaborate disguises, Falma wears a simple robe with a deep hood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I use this because I can simply get rid of it if I have to.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">He emphasizes his selection based on rationality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, isn’t that simple selection a little ridiculous? Why does anyone walk along the streets with such an appearance? If you haven’t noticed it yet, you don’t want to go in that style.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma leaves the pharmacy and returns after a short time later. He takes off the hood and glows in embarrassment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you get caught?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you get called out?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah. About ten people recognized me.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">While looking at the hand mirror, Falma falls into serious frustrations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s too difficult to be in disguise… I’ll have to do my best so I don’t stand out more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen is frightened and has no words while looking at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It can’t be helped, Falma-san. I know the reason for your failure, so can Lotte-chan lend you some of her plain clothes?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eeh?! Wha- Does it mean I have to cross-dress?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte panics more than Falma at this point. There’s a lingering feeling of a scary spectacle </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>l
<p class="calibre1">to come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About the disguise. I like the clothes I’m wearing at the mansion I’ve selected, but I’m too tired to fetch it, so just lend what you have to me.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte and Ellen put their hands on Falma’s shoulders. The height difference between Falma and Lotte has gradually opened up recently, but her skirt can still be worn even if her height is slightly shorter than his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are larger ones that I can lend them to you!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte betrays Falma’s expectation daringly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop it!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There isn’t any other choice, Falma-san. I’ll help you change your clothes!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma resists for quite a long while before changing into Lotte’s clothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte usually helps dress Falma with his clothes as his servant at the mansion and knows Falma’s body size quite well. He finalizes his disguise with a servant’s apron just in his size. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll never be able to walk around in this.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he thinks he can’t, he is already in Lotte’s clothes in a blink of an eye, and with the prepared materials at hand, Ellen puts the final touch using a hat and a long-haired wig, then the part-time pharmacists quickly apply makeup on him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh my Falma-kun… you are too adorable. Aren’t you such a beautiful girl?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte nods her head in agreement. But Falma is disappointed at himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is awful. Where is the pride in being the alchemist’s disciple? The skirt might as well can be said to be a mogul.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma’s impression of himself as the only alchemist who wears a skirt who tries to sneak into that gathering. First of all, he doesn’t like to be the only alchemy who’s wearing a skirt. It’s only logical that chemists who handle dangerous chemicals do not leave their skin exposed wearing such outfits while protecting themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh my, since we’re done, do you want to take a look in the mirror?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want to look.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma vigorously shakes his head with all his might. Lotte immediately takes a picture of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t take a picture of me!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sory Falma-sama…” [1] </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre bitterly laughs and expresses his compassion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, this is enough. Let’s go.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma appears tired before he even leaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riding on Pierre’s wagon, the group of three alchemists head to a gathering called the Alchemist Study Group. The gathering is said to be held in a large building on the outskirts  of  the  Imperial  City.  From  a  distance,  Falma  and  his  colleagues  see  the gathered alchemists and pharmacologists who stand around at the basement entrance of the venue building, as their membership fees are being collected before entering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a short period of time, thirty people can be seen entering. The venue seems to be successful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The event is thriving. How much is the membership fee?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma asks Pierre in a whisper. Pierre folds his finger to show the amount. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really, they charge that much? And yet, it’s so successful…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The entrance fee alone is this amount, and the mysterious methods’ sales are even higher. It’s okay, I’ve withdrawn enough money for the fees. I’ll take care of this for you.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre is in tears because the price is too high.[2] </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre indicates that they col ect a large membership fee for the study session’s justified cause. However, it seems that there are many pharmacologists and alchemists who </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">participated in study sessions even after suffering bankruptcies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is rumored that the leading alchemist learned how to synthesize the philosopher’s stone, made a lot of money and bet on a one-shot reversal in making their money back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will pay for us.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma gives Pierre the money for al  three people. He states he wil  pay for El en as wel . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s alright, Falma-san. I’m not short with money.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know that, but I’ll pay because you invited us.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma displays a strange side of gentleman’s pride (while wearing a dress). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really? Thank you. Then, let me thank you for your offer.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh my, I’m sorry for my inconvenience.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre gladly ties up his opened purse string tightly. He looks relieved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then, it’s finally here.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre turns around, and Falma’s party heads to the venue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, are we still able to enter?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre makes a low bow and greets the admission fee collector. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s about to fill up. Show me the alchemist’s badge.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like the other alchemists, Pierre takes out the badge in his chest’s pocket and shows it to the fee collector. The authentic badge has a registration number. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These guys don’t have badges, but they are my disciples. Please allow them in for this study session. I’ll pay the entrance fee for all three people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre converses with an innocent demeanor and pays the fee that was given by Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma and Ellen nod their heads to confirm Pierre’s statement and remain quiet in order not to stand out. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">Ellen’s men’s clothing is the issue in making our group suspicious looking, contrary to</i> <i class="calibre3">my women’s clothing! </i>) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fee collector is closely examining Falma’s and Ellen’s faces, but decides to give them permission to enter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They are able to pass through without worrying about Falma’s disguise failing them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See that, I can manage my disguising role.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen proudly tells Falma, who is overwhelmed by their successful entry. She wasn’t questioned to remove her hat during that examination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The underground venue is a large entertainment hall, and although countless candles are used, the brightness is dim overall. The venue is packed with alchemists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are quite a few pharmacologists among the crowd belonging to the Pharmacology Guild known to Falma and Pierre, but no one notices them. This is all due to their elaborate disguises. When Falma listens, he hears the various clamors all around him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Herme s-san is really wonderful. He can be quite generous in selling his secret arts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With such a statement, the name Herme s is an alchemist-like name in origin, so Falma listens more tentatively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It seems that some alchemists have succeeded in the field of alchemy by purchasing the mysteries offered master Herme s.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma continues his eavesdropping on their discussions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">It’s a classic decision that alchemists prefer dimness to show off their alchemy and not</i> <i class="calibre3">during the day. </i>) </p>
<p class="calibre1">In some cases, the method of lighting may cause mercury to appear to be like gold. If one reviews the history of the Earth, there was actually such an alchemy scam. As he further listens to their conversations, he smells a fraud in the making, but he can’t instigate fraudulent yet. After all, it is a world of divine arts. Similar to Falma, it’s no surprise that there are alchemists with unknown abilities like [Substance Creation]. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">The alchemist in question finally makes the appearance on time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A man wears a white mask with a red robe comes into the hall, then introduces himself and his female apprentice alchemist. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why is the master alchemist wears a mask?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre asks the alchemist who was next to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because a real alchemy that produces gold like it’s hot water is dangerous, and the the alchemist can be targeted by bandits all over the country if they know of the person’s identity. I don’t think he hides his face because his technique isn’t real.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see.” Ellen doubts the reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Isn’t it just a scam and he can’t show his face? Ellen suspects the reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Master Herme s, please continue.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome to the Alchemy Study Group, and this will be counted as the 8th session. It is an honor to have this many alchemists gather tonight.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">He acts like a gentleman. However, when Falma hears that voice… </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">Hmm…? I heard that voice from somewhere… where did I hear it? </i>) But he can’t recall where he heard that voice from. He wonders if he heard it from a customer who came to the pharmacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is he a commoner? His tone of speech is like an aristocrat.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre asks Ellen as she also ponders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. He appears to be a divine art user… I don’t really know it yet. He sounds like a nobleman from the Imperial City because he has no accents in his speech. I think he is a lower rank aristocrat because he is so obsessed with money.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upper aristocrats do not pay much attention to money, but they do pursue in expanding their territories. For that reason, Pierre is assuming the presenting alchemist to be a lower aristocrat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m currently hiding my identity for the time being.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wonder if you’re aware that you’re a fraud. If you’re such a talented alchemist, why don’t you showcase your proud secret divine art in front of the Empress, who wil  </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">grant you Her Majesty’s protection of the Empire?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then let us demonstrate our alchemy using the philosopher’s stone to all of you.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alchemy demonstration begins. Herme s has his female assistant bring in a fist-size red  mineral  called  Philosopher’s  Stone.  When  they  crush  the  stone,  a  red  mineral inside is exposed. Illuminated by the candle flames, the mineral glows mysteriously like a ruby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crowd is obsessed with every move Herme s makes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I believe you all can see that even when I break the stone, it is red in the middle. When the philosopher’s stone melts, it reacts to lead when it’s combined.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After his statement, Herme s heats the mineral in a glass crucible with the philosopher’s stone and allows the liquidized mineral to cool off its vapor as it transforms into a liquid metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While watching the demonstration, Falma notices the smell of sulfur, which permeates slowly to the surrounding areas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">Isn’t the philosopher’s stone that Hermes boasts about is cinnabar? </i>) Falma is  almost  confident in his determination.  Cinnabar is mercury sulfide (HgS) mineral, where sulfur and mercury can be extracted through a heating process. If his assumption is correct, heating should produce mercury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s not the philosopher’s stone, it’s cinnabar, isn’t it?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma secretly asks Pierre, but Pierre’s eyes are blinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is that?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a compound of sulfur and mercury. You see, mercury is mined in that state.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then Ellen laughs wryly as if she’s troubled by Falma’s explanation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mercury can be extracted as a liquid, but why is it a red crystal? Why does silver liquid come out of the red crystals?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen argues as she uses her knowledge on the state of natural mercury, that is, can be obtained directly in liquid form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That is correct…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">Well, there are cases where it can be mined from a liquid state, but… does this world</i> <i class="calibre3">collect mercury in that way? The production situation may be different from that of the</i> <i class="calibre3">Earth. </i>) </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At this point, the Philosopher’s Stone has melted. Is there an alchemist who brought some lead with them?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">It appears that there are quite a few enthusiastic alchemists who bring lead at every gathering to have their lead converted into gold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t it possible to use my lead and then give it to me as it’s made into gold?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course, so let’s give it a try.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s tries to pour philosopher’s stone liquid onto the lead into the crucible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Show me in the crucible first.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">A voice is coming somewhere in hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s fine.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">The alchemists at the front check and recheck it to make sure there is nothing in the crucible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing is inside…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can add in the philosopher’s stone and lead.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the hall regains its silence, Herme s places the materials into the crucible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to take out the gold now. I will not touch the crucible with any finger so that it doesn’t get mistaken that I’ve replaced the content with the counterfeit money.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s sets the crucible back onto the fire and begins to reheat it. And then he casts </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">a chant of a mesmerizing spell.[3] </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">He’s just chanting a spell. There’s no mythical power. </i>) As far as Falma can see, Herme s long chant is neither a spell trigger nor a divine power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He may be a divine art user, but he hasn’t used any divine power of the god here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s’s chanting continues as the alchemists watch him with bated breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite a bit of time has passed since the demonstration initiated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You over there, lend me some help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s tel s the old male alchemist in the foreground to tilt the crucible with something like fire scissors (a tong?) toward the audience. He follows Herme s’s instructions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eh, like this?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tilt it until you can see inside, so please have a look.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the time the flames go out, there are many spoonfuls of gold in the crucible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Using this method, we have succeeded in refining gold.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s proudly tells the audience. Cheers burst out from all sides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Herme s is a genius! He’s a great sage!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He is a true alchemist! It’s many times more than the amount of lead I put in.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">The alchemists are intoxicated from the demonstration as they keep on praising and applauding. There is no alchemist known who had succeeded in the field of alchemy since the in olden days to the current times. There is a lot of passion welling up in the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you think, Falma-san?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre, who has no clue, asks Falma. Falma answers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mercury evaporates by heating, so naturally it disappears, but I didn’t understand why the heated mercury makes gold…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">He suspects that there was a different mixture within mercury, but the mercury obtained by heating the mineral, which seems to be mercury sulfide, was distil ed until it became pure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since  the  alchemist  placed  the  materials  into  a  glass  crucible,  he  couldn’t  make  a golden mixture unless he painted something on the wall of the glass crucible. If there was any additional mixture, there would be remnants of impurities in the crucible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there is nothing but gold at the bottom of the crucible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">Hmm… he didn’t even replace it with a fake, and there isn’t anything wrong in the crucible</i>) Falma crosses his arms and mutters. Falma did not see divine art being used, so it’s probably an illusion with some planted tricks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather than having the mystery revealed to him, it is closer to claiming Falma’s senses can see through the planted tricks of the magical act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So then didn’t that philosopher’s stone produce gold from nothing is the real thing?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen inquires as if she is not convinced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t see it to be fake…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre also nods in agreement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About that, I think the philosopher’s stone is mercury sulfide.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two may finally believe in the existence of the philosopher’s stone. But Falma disagrees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I didn’t see it at first glance, but the shape of the resulting gold may have been melted once and deposited. I wonder if it was dissolved along with the mercury.) Gold dissolves in mercury to form a mercury compound called amalgam. When gold amalgam, which is a mercury compound, is heated, mercury evaporates as vapor and leaves the gold behind. From that phase, he suspects a large amount of mercury vapor should have been evaporated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Mercury elimination] </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma cleans up the pollutants scattered throughout the hall on behalf of Herme s’s demonstration.  Inhaling  mercury  vapor  is  not  good.  Not  knowing  that,  Herme s  is bathed in a storm of praises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some of you may speculate that this is counterfeit money.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a fearless smile, Herme s proclaims his words that the alchemists there are likely to have in their throats. Some alchemists are skeptical. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is there an alchemist who wants to confirm the creation of this money? Check it out.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Herme s overlooks the entire hall, Pierre raises his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it okay to use a touchstone?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre is also an alchemist and has a touchstone to use at the ready. A touchstone is an ore for measuring the purity of gold. When rubbing gold on the touchstone, the color changes depending on its purity. Fake gold is known as counterfeit money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s is being quite generous. Pierre deliberately polishes the surface of his own golden nugget then rubs the newly created gold nugget that came out from the crucible against the same touchstone, and finds that it is  certainly  gold.  It isn’t  the highest purity, but that’s merely a refining problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is significant news that the money has just been made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe only the surface is gold, can I break the gold?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Pierre retreats from the front, another alchemist steps forward. Some people suspect that it is just thick gold plating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It doesn’t matter what you do. You can measure using the specific gravity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the man splits the golden nugget with a knife, a brilliant golden color appears in the middle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s definitely gold…!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gold is made from the philosopher’s stone and lead…! Sell me the secret!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is almost no doubt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you know that the philosopher’s stone is the real thing and you want to buy the philosopher’s stone-synthesis esoteric technique, please request it from my disciple later. Join me tonight. I’ll offer it a little cheaper for everyone.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s has already entered his sales discussion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will buy it.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Philosopher’s Stone is real!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither of the two alchemists from before claims the precious golden nugget which seems to belong to someone in the group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s going on, Falma-kun, isn’t it true?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen cannot disprove what she’s observing either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A lot of victims are about to be born, but Falma lacks the decisive factor to speak up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are things I’m curious about, so I’ll go see it more closely. Before the evidence is obliterated.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma informs Ellen and Pierre, then he navigates in between the crowd and moves forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the assistant is trying to put away the equipment used in the demonstration, Falma who dressed up as a servant-style beautiful girl approaches the assistant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s wrong, young miss?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s notices and looks back at Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Again, can you show me the crucible?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma speaks out to Herme s. He uses his voice as loud as possible as he approaches from the back. Falma’s voice hasn’t changed since the age of 12, speaks in a female’s </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">falsetto tone, which one can say he doesn’t sound like a boy. Pierre and El en recognized the situation and do not feel uncomfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aah, yes.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">The surface of the crucible is porous. </i>) Falma takes a closer look for details and taps the crucible with a pair of fire scissors (tong?). Then, the sound changes depending on where he strikes the crucible. It is exactly as Falma expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Hahaa… I see.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s  the  point  of  being  concerned  about  its  design?  The  crucible  had  been constructed by another alchemist.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">While observing Herme s, who intervenes a little too quick with his words, Falma replies with greater suspicion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah you’re right, it might be true that the alchemist is to blame. It appears that there is still some liquid metal left from extracted Philosopher’s Stone, so can you show me your wonderful arcane technique once again?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma praises Herme s for a redemonstration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No matter how many times we try, we’ll get the same result; I can do it, but let’s exchange for a new crucible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s chuckles at Falma… Falma might sound like an ignorant idiot being an alchemist apprentice, but Falma never smiles back at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, this crucible is fine.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s’s line of sight from behind the mask darts around in fear a bit, and Falma doesn’t miss it. Herme s can never be able to reproduce it in the same crucible. Falma realizes it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My expectation is that you can’t make any more money in this crucible.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re in the way, princess. I’m sorry to butt in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">The jeering is directed at Falma from the crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kids shouldn’t come out into front, it’s the same thing when you see the same technique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Show me the next technique quickly.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, what the (?)!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma is grabbed by the neck and pulled back by one of the impatient men. During that time of the struggle, Falma lightly scrapes the inner wall of the crucible with a pin using the hair clip and returns to where Ellen and his friend are. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Surely, the study session time is limited. Let’s move on to the next arcane secret, and I will show you the homunculus as the next demonstration.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herme s clears his throat and proceeds with the show. He has a sense of relief and the fear of his heart subsides. The homunculus is turning into the highlight of this event. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m back.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you find out something?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Lead elimination] </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma confirms the condition of the residue left on the pins. And… he ridicules himself during his conversation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Haha, I almost got it.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eeh !? Can you elaborate a bit?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">He explains that the bottom of the crucible has holes, and the gold was squished into them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this case, mercury has a very strong surface tension, so even if it is placed in a porous crucible, it will not enter into the holes. Even if mercury has strong surface tension, it still was not the case as there was a high density of metal such as gold powder or lead filled into the holes. Gold was compacted into the holes so that it can be drawn out during the heating. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">The crucible was charged with gold powder or their alloys in advance. When mercury was added, the hot liquidized metal melts the compacted metal at the bottom of the crucible, slowly drawing the rest of the metals into the main cavity, and resulted into an amalgam of lead, gold and mercury. Then when the reheating was applies, this amalgam continues to melt and liquefies at low temperatures. By tilting the crucible during the metals in their liquefied state, gold-lead amalgam is formed from the combination of compacted materials extracted from holes of the crucible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lead, which had been converted to lead oxide by heating, was absorbed by the surface of the crucible due to the capillary phenomenon acting upon it, but the gold remained  in  the  crucible  during  the  heating.  Mercury  becomes  vapor  through  the heating process and evaporated, removing it completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…That’s why gold remains in the crucible.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There is all there is to it…! But I didn’t understand the explanation at all!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Earlier, when Falma struck the crucible with scissors (thong) and scraped the inside with a pin, there was a void in the bottom, which lead was absorbed onto the porous surface of the crucible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a hypothesis at this moment, but I’ll tell you if he demonstrates it again.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma thinks it may be good for Herme s not to be stopped here and allows him to stew in his panic until the next gathering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, what can I do from now on?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next time, Falma deems it’s good to prepare a crucible and use it for a redemonstration on his own. It’s best to have the attendees use it. Otherwise, there will be no evidence to show. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">It’s an elaborate scam. </i>) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma is impressed, but he doesn’t intend to leave it alone. This is to prevent any more victims… </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Might as well, let’s check the homunculus out before heading home.“ </p>
