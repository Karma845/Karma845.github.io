<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; Cobra&#8217;s Hideout</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were headed for a two-story, slightly rundown building in the slums.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never thought the day would come when I would be able to exterminate Cobra&#8230;the feeling is so gratifying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My Lord. What shall we do? Shall we obliterate the whole building?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next to Sebas, who was feeling emotional, Zero started to say something outrageous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nah, that would be a bit much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There might be people trapped in there, so let&#8217;s not do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s true. My apologies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero bowed his head as Sebas and I rebuked him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, don&#8217;t worry about it&#8230;now then, let&#8217;s start with a barrier.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said and erected a barrier around the building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also become soundproof, so no matter how much violence goes on inside, it won&#8217;t disturb the neighbors. Now, they can’t escape even if they want to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““Understood.””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Zero and Sebas nodded their heads, Ellis&#8217; voice echoed in my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Master, I have a report to make.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm? What is it, Ellis?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;There are several paths leading to the outside in the basement. One leads to Almuth Balazel&#8217;s residence, and the others to random buildings in the royal capital.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motherfucka, it really is true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you identify which one these Cobra cocksuckers might use to escape?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Affirmative. The passage most likely to be used for escape is this one.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with her voice, a passageway appeared in red on the map visible with God Eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;At present, there are three strong enemy reactions. One on the second floor and two in the basement. They are probably executives. Sebastian will be able to defeat them, no matter which one he encounters.&gt;&gt;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, you’re able to figure out that much. Well done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sebastian, once we’re in, I want you to go alone to the location I&#8217;m going to give you. It is most likely their escape route.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And it looks like there&#8217;s one guy on the second floor and two more in the basement. Zero, head upstairs once we get in. I&#8217;ll go downstairs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having finished assigning tasks, we headed for the main entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two men were standing at the entrance, chatting and laughing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first glance, they appeared to be mere residents, but when I looked at their status, I saw that they were assassins. In other words, they were enemies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without time to raise their voices, their throats were instantly slit by me and Zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of us broke into the building and sent each enemy we encountered on their merry way before they even had time to raise their voices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, going by stats, Cobra&#8217;s fighting ability was high, but Sebas is around level 100 and Zero and I around level 300. Not much of an opponent, I’d say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Found the stairway to the basement. Sebas and I will head that way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood. Then I&#8217;ll proceed to exterminate the second floor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You do that. Apparently, the one over there is quite strong, so don&#8217;t kill him, okay? He could be an executive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kukuku. My Lord, as long as I don’t kill him, anything goes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, knock yourself out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roger that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero said, a smile formed on his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I parted from Zero and went down the stairs, which led to a dimly lit passageway with lamps made of magic stone placed in various places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas, following my instructions, headed to set up an ambush on the escape route before the enemy became aware of our presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Checking with God Eye, I detected signs of people behind the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;It appears that one of the executives is in the back room. The other one is moving in the direction Sebastian went. I don&#8217;t think they will notice us.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it. Is there anyone not related to Cobra being held captive? We can&#8217;t afford to kill them by mistake.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-68387996' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-68387996' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;All right. There seem to be three women. The third room from the back, on the right.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After confirming this, I immediately started making my move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I carefully entered the room through the door so as not to alert the enemy, and eliminated the bogies in the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of this, a certain door caught my attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When probed, I detected the presence of three people inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at their statuses, it is obvious that they are not assassins. Which means&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They must be the kidnapped victims&#8230;I better rescue them first and then talk later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I transformed the doorknob with my molding skill and unlocked it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I looked inside, I saw three women chained together. One was in her 20s, one was in her mid-teens, and the other was probably only eight years old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they saw me, they screamed “Hieek” and tried to escape toward the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s all right. I am here to exterminate these animals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said to them in a low whisper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“R-Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course. Here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took out my adventurer&#8217;s card and showed it to the woman, who seemed to be the oldest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A jet-black adventurer’s card&#8230;Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you perhaps, the EX rank adventurer, the great hero, Haruto, sir?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh gosh how far has this spread&#8230;I thought, but I affirmed it so that the conversation wouldn&#8217;t get complicated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh, well, yeah. So, I&#8217;m going to unlock these chains now, but there are still quite a few enemies deep inside. I&#8217;m going to go take them out, so just wait here. Okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them nodded quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I broke the chains with magic, and while at it, healed all the wounds on their bodies with recovery magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, with the three astonished people behind me, I proceeded to the next room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly annihilated the rest of the rooms, and the only room that remained was the one at the far end, where the executives seemed to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess this is the only one left. Three presences in total, huh?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve gotten rid of each one of them so far without raising an alarm, so it seems my presence is still undetected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I strengthened my hearing and perused inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Then, we’ll be disposing of that woman real soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll take care of it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By that woman, were they referring to one of the ones I just rescued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it ain&#8217;t going to happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I busted the door open with a loud bang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who—ughaa!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who—the fuggh”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, as soon as the two men who seemed to be subordinates reacted, I closed in and cut them down in one fell swoop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A well-dressed man in an expensive looking outfit, sitting on the other side of the table, stood up and glared at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Who the fuck are you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh excuse me, I seemed to have lost my way and somehow ended up here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmph, yeah, nice try&#8230;but, no matter, die motherfucker.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man jumped over the desk in an instant, drew his sword and slashed at me. But I dared to duck just in time and counter-kicked him in the gut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—You’re no simple fellow, are you? Not only did you evade my attack, you even counterattacked.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, you don’t say? Or maybe, you’re just too weak?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cut the bullshit!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at his level, and it was 93. Certainly, ordinary adventurers and soldiers can&#8217;t hope to compete with this kind of level&#8230;to me though, he’s just another small fry, same as his subordinates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive tried to swing his sword at me again, and the next moment, fresh blood danced in the air and the sword fell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh, ghaaaaaah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man crumpled to the floor and screamed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He probably didn&#8217;t see it, but I cut off both of his arms.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-72277599' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-72277599' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t want him to bleed to death, so I just used recovery magic to stop the bleeding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stared at me in confusion, as if he couldn&#8217;t grasp what had happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the hell just happened? What did you do, you sonuvabitch?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I merely slashed you, though it appears you didn&#8217;t see it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re saying I couldn’t make out the speed of your attack&#8230;I’mma ask again. Who the hell are you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I silently took out my adventurer card and showed it to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see now. So, you are the infamous Demon King. But defeating me won’t make Cobra—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pissed off that he called me a demon king, and he started to talk like a typical villain, which annoyed me even more, so I put him to sleep with magic and restrained him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ellis, are there any more enemies in the area?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;No, sir. Zero had no problem on his end, even defeated some executives. The passageway where Sebastian headed to, a few had just tried to escape, and it seems that they have already been defeated. One of the remaining executives is about to arrive there, but Sebastian should have no problems dealing with him.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. If that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;ll leave that side to Sebas, and bring those guys to the ground, then join up with Zero.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except for the executives, there are only dead bodies left, but lemme just tie ‘em up in a corner for now. The soldiers should be coming soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I escorted the three women back to the ground, I asked them about their story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, they were all daughters of noble families and had been kidnapped as blackmail material.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as they were on the ground, they lowered their heads intently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you very much for rescuing us!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please, let us give you something in return for this grace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for rescuing us, big brother!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a little embarrassing to be thanked so straightforwardly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don&#8217;t worry about it, I didn&#8217;t rescue you in hopes of a return&#8230;well then, it looks like the inner room on the first floor is safe, so just wait there for a while longer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said and headed to Zero’s location.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero, having parted from Haruto, was walking up the stairs leading to the second floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm. Judging from the presence ahead, there don’t seem to be many.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had become a butler through and through that his tone was polite even when no one was around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He walked up the stairs without making a sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two men were standing at the landing on the second floor, but they saw Zero and called out to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;A butler? Who the hell are you supposed to be?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How did you get here in the first place? What about the guys downstairs?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two men were wary, pointing their swords at the unidentified fellow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in spite of the weapons pointed at him, Zero bowed gracefully and introduced himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My name is Zero, and I am a butler in a certain mansion. If you&#8217;re wondering about the plight of the gentlemen downstairs, I can assure you that they’re sleeping quite soundly&#8230;one which they will never wake up from, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing Zero&#8217;s words, the men looked at each other as if wondering, what the fuck is he talking about?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then they looked at Zero again, but he was no longer there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where’d he go?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Find him!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They couldn’t have lost sight of him in such a narrow space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two men started to panic, but then they heard Zero&#8217;s voice from behind them.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-34908026' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-34908026' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a pair of slowpokes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““The hell!?””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As dimwitted as they may appear, they were still no doubt assassins, the two turned around swinging their swords in response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That can’t be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—That&#8217;s but an illusion. The real one is right here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those words were the last they heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero then began probing for signs and the number of enemies on the second floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A total of ten in that side room, three at the far end&#8230;only one guy seemed worthy of note, I guess he must be an executive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero began entering the rooms, killing enemies along the way, and finally arrived at the room where the executive was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero quickly tried to open the door, but it was locked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh dear&#8230;what a badly fitted door, this one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero said, then gripped the lock and broke it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as he opened the door to go in, knives came flying in. However—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““The fuck?!””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two startled voices leaked out.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yup. Zero had easily grabbed all the knives that flew at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this, the strong among them, who seemed to be an executive, asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re pretty good&#8230;who the hell are you? Who sent you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I apologize for the rough greeting. My name is Zero, and I&#8217;m the butler of a certain individual.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero replied to the man in his thirties who was sitting in the chair across from him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two black-robed guards stood beside him, their weapons at the ready, wary of Zero&#8217;s attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, what business does Mr. Butler have here? You do know where you are, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is Cobra&#8217;s headquarters, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing Zero&#8217;s words, the executive man&#8217;s eyebrows twitched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;That’s right, and very few people are aware of that fact. So, how can we help you, a request perhaps?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not at all. My only purpose for coming here is to decimate this stronghold.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmph, cocky bastard. What&#8217;s your deal with us, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero narrowed his eyes and stared at the executive who smirked scornfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You tried to assassinate my master in a back alley, ring a bell?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Your master, is the adventurer Haruto, huh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see, well, that makes sense&#8230;but do you think you can do that, in your current predicament?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—What a dumb question. Rather, it’d be funny if you lowly insects think that you can really defeat me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intimidation that Zero unleashed made both the executive and subordinates unable to take a single step forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh, what pressure&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hiek&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ughh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the two subordinates collapsed, unable to even remain standing, and both got stabbed through the heart by Zero&#8217;s sword and died.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive tried to stand up to escape, but his legs gave way and he fell to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are the only one left.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“D-Don’t do it! I’ll give you all my money! So please—don’tghaaaaahhh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the scream, blood splashed through the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero grabbed the unconscious executive, whose arms had been cut off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Done already. So boring&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After stopping the bleeding for the time being, Zero headed for the stairs leading to the first floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After parting with Haruto, Sebas was heading toward the entrance of the underground passage that would be an escape route.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—I guess this is the place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without hesitation, Sebas rushed into the room and dropped the heads of the three guards inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm. I wonder if these men are the ones responsible for seizing anyone who trespasses into this passageway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He opened the door further back, which then revealed a single pathway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now then, according to master Haruto, a few of them should be coming this way&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after Sebas muttered that, the door to the entrance of the room was opened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hohoho. Nothing less from Master Haruto, as usual.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas muttered to himself, and the two men who had entered the room stopped in their tracks when they saw the corpses lying at his feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Who goes there?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The larger of the two men asked with a sharp gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My name is Sebastian. I have come to exterminate Cobra.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The larger man reacted when he heard the word exterminate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ohh, have you gone senile, old geezer?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh no, I’m very much in good health, thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That so&#8230;then go to hell.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the large man said this, the other man, who had been waiting on standby, approached Sebas, throwing a knife at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, well, well, this is quite the boisterous greeting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas effortlessly avoided the knife and cut down the man approaching him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Ohh. You’re pretty good, geezer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for the compliment. What can I say, I&#8217;m feeling pretty psyched about this since I have history with you guys.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“History huh&#8230;come to think of it, Sebastian hmm, a few decades ago, one of the top executives at the time was killed by a rookie S-rank adventurer bearing the same name&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, you know about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow, so it really is you. Kukuku, this just got interesting. How about I demonstrate to you the power of the current executives!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as he said that, the man closed in on Sebas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive was not holding a sword, but he probably had a weapon of sorts on his fists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas judged so and turned his body to avoid the swinging right fist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I knew you would do that! —So long, butler geezer!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive smiled and activated a contraption in his left arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Guhaa&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, the executive was coughing up blood from his mouth.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-What just——?!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked down and saw that his left arm had been cut off and a sword was sticking out of his gut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh, gguh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time that Sebas pulled out his sword, the executive retreated, letting out a cry of anguish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, you’re still standing, I guess you really do live up to the title of an executive of Cobra uh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“F-Fuck you&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But the one I fought before was much stronger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With such a dismayed voice, Sebas&#8217;s figure disappeared from the executive&#8217;s sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, the man collapsed to his knees and fell forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before he could tell what was going on, both of his legs were broken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas smashed them with his sword, still in its sheath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Guuuaaaaaahhhh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man screamed out in pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right now, stop being so dramatic and take a nap will you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas said, and silenced him with a blow to the neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now then, I better take him upstairs, just in case.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇ ◇ ◇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I, Haruto, headed upstairs, Zero had just come down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was carrying a man without arms as if he were carrying luggage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good work, who is he?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He appears to be an executive. He didn’t put up much of a fight though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, at our levels, you’ll find that most people are no match for us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero nodded in agreement with my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was able to link up with Zero and returned to the first floor, where Sebas had just returned from the basement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, good job&#8230;is that an executive?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, I guess. He was not as formidable as they used to be, I have to say&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well Sebas, you’ve also become stronger than when you were an S-rank rookie, haven’t you? And it seems you’ve been training with Zero lately, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s true&#8230;is that person with Zero an executive as well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero nodded in response to Sebas&#8217; question.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-84135295' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-84135295' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I captured one of the executives alive too, but I left him in the basement because he was a pain in the ass&#8230;well, looks like the soldiers are here, I guess I’ll leave the rest to them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that said, I released the barrier and soon after, I heard the sound of armor scraping and footsteps coming from outside the building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero and Sebas rolled the two men they had captured to a corner and joined the women hiding in the back room on the first floor, and we went outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the soldiers was Thomas, the gatekeeper, whom I knew well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, Thomas, you came as well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well done, Mr. Haruto. His Majesty thought it would be better to have someone familiar on site to talk to Mr. Haruto&#8230;so, how did it go?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Makes sense. The Cobra perps are in there. Only three of the executives are alive, two are on the first floor and one in the basement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t dare to mention the other members, but Thomas guessed it and his face turned blue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“G-Got it. Also Mr. Haruto, what about the ladies over there?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas glanced at the three behind me and tilted his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They were being held downstairs. I’ll leave them in your care, so please treat them politely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, also. There were several hidden escape routes in the basement. I don&#8217;t know where they lead, but please try and look into it and figure it out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I know it is connected to Count Balazel&#8217;s mansion, but if I tell them that, they will wonder how I came to know all that. So, I&#8217;ll let them find out on their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand! So what are you planning to do next, Mr. Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm? I’m outta here. I can’t do much with so little information until you finish your investigation. So tell Dillan I&#8217;ll see him tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas and the other soldiers bowed their heads in response to my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And immediately, they proceeded into the building to investigate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of us headed straight back to the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was already quite late, and although I already had dinner, I was craving something light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we arrived at the mansion, Zero opened the front door for us. He seems to have mastered how to act as a butler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re back~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, welcome back, Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one who greeted me was Finne.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We all contributed to making dinner and were waiting for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne said and took us to the dining room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dining room was filled up, and the table was laid out with a simple buffet ready for pickings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we dug into the hot homemade late-night meal, we talked about what had happened at Cobra&#8217;s hideout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest, however, will have to wait until we see what the soldiers uncover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We split up for the day, and I went to bed with Finne at her request.</span></p>
