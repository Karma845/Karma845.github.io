<h3>Chapter 15: The Truth About Philosopher's Stone</h3>



<p class="calibre1">One certain night after dinner at the de Medicis family’s residence. While Falma is studying the patient’s case under Palle’s care, he is called to Bruno’s office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s going on?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What happened to Falma, and what did he do?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Startled by Palle’s inquiry, Falma strains his neck into the room as he’s about to enter Bruno’s office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you requested my presence, father?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bruno’s expression is grim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It  appears  that  Count  Tre moï lle  had  resigned  as  a  court  pharmacologist.  Does  it involve you?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bruno stares at Falma while waiting for his response. Falma wants to state that Hugo attacked  him  and he  barely  made  it back  in  one  piece, but  his  words  are  jumbled incoherently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be-bec… it was because of…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He can’t say he doesn’t know about the situation. However, Bruno advises Falma to speak in retelling the incident to them with the full background of the situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As of now, many pharmacologists already acknowledge your knowledge and skills as a pharmacist are full-fledged or better. I want you to keep Her Majesty’s blessing in mind. Yet, what you’re stating as the truth, and the truth may appear unacceptable by the  royal  court.  Always  remember  that  you’re  still  a  half-human.  Especially,  if  you happen to turn someone with tremendous political influence into an enemy against the royal court.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. You’re right.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma listens to Bruno’s explanation obediently. Bruno suspects that Falma may have been inconveniently involved behind Hugo’s retirement. Since there has never been a case where a royal court apothecary voluntarily retired, there is suspicion that this incident was Bruno’s conspiracy which lurked in the depth of the shadow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t fight with the courtiers, even if you’re a little vexed with them. Don’t be ashamed, criticize, or dismiss them unnecessarily. Especially when you’re still a child, with no position of power as a speaker.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll remember my position.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bruno’s attitude may be different if he knows about what had happened, surely he will recognize Falma’s resulting behaviors, but Bruno only comprehends Falma’s current overkill actions during this incident without realizing the truth so Falma must accept Bruno’s scolding obediently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will send an apology to Count Tre moï lle.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bruno was about to have a session of moxibustion[1] performed by Falma, which was originally scheduled, but Falma instead decided to follow Bruno during this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Falma is being unusually enthusiastic about writing letters during the break at the pharmacy without any ill intention, Lotte asks while serving tea and sweets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Falma-sama, are you writing to someone?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">The letter is going to be delivered where homing pigeons cannot be used. The uses of carrier pigeons that depend on the pigeon’s homing instinct are basically one-way streets, so they can only be used for people who have frequently kept in contact. In addition, a letter may be more convenient because the carrier pigeon that had skipped once from its intended destination would not return to the same destination by itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even so, sending letters is a rare case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Falma-kun, you’re writing a letter…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen peaks her head over him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to visit the honorable Hugo, so I’m just letting you know.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">A part of the reason for this letter is hidden from Ellen, even though the event for Hugo was already known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I believe it may be quite scary for Falma to visit him after he had been beaten up so much… he might think your visitation is to chase after him.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Falma doesn’t have to worry about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is why I’m writing this letter. He doesn’t have to be prepared. He will not be surprised if I suddenly show up.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">She heard from the court officials that the letter from Falma would be delivered, so she was concerned about Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m surprised, or more likely, I believe it’s nothing more than a threat.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen quietly mumbles to Falma, who doesn’t appear to be deterred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll follow you. You don’t know what’s going to happen when you visit the enemy’s home base.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">Hmm. I think it’s more dangerous to have Ellen with me. </i>) Falma doesn’t think Ellen accompanying him is a hindrance, but he wants to avoid putting Ellen in danger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The other person can no longer use divine art, so don’t worry about it.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">If a godsman relies heavily on the supports from the gods like Hugo, then is deprived of the connection, he is nothing more than a common soldier. Moreover, Hugo is a middle-aged  man  whose  physical  strength  is  weakened,  the  difference  in  ability between him and Falma is comparative between heaven and earth, as Falma’s senses sharpened and his thoughts accelerated during his perception of a crisis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what happens when there is a physical attack? Such as projectiles, for example.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take a look at this.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">After confirming no one is around beside Ellen, he uses his pen’s nib and thrusts into his arm. However, the pen’s tip pierces through Falma’s arm and stabs directly onto the desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hu-huh !? What’s going on !? Your body.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What happened?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is what Falma wants in making his intention known. Since Falma’s body is half-mortal and half-divine, physical attacks can slip through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since this is not clear to anyone else, I’m deemed more the enemy. I’m not worried about it.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen is visibly worried. Falma can read her mood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you for your concern. If so I want you to follow me by all means. By the way, I want to ask Ellen if you are good at high places?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen has an unpleasant premonition as her face shows nervousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have to make sure to ask you first.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen regrets in saying that she will accompany him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next day, the two are flying at a tremendous speed through the clear blue sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kya! So this is what you meant when you asked me!!?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen’s screaming keeps rising while sitting behind Falma. Ellen can’t physically touch the Medicine God’s staff directly, but Ellen can hold onto Falma’s shoulders as they’re sitting on the staff in a two-seater position while flying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop it! I’m falling!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">It appears as if the two are just having an aerial date. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can slow it down a bit more than this. Are you sure you’re flying at a low speed since it seems a bit fast?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma is used to flying at this pace, so his sense of speed is out of the ordinary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hii-hii!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  it’ll  be  just  a  little  longer,  so  try  to  be  calm.  Since  you’re  holding  onto  my shoulders and afraid to look down, why don’t you look up instead?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">While listening to Ellen screaming hiihii, he reviews the map of the path he’s taking in flying towards Hugo’s territory in a straight line, and the two quickly arrive near their destination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When she glances at the ground as they’re landing, Ellen peeps with a dismal voice as she says, “Ki, need a break…” and guzzles down the water created from her divine art to quench her thirsty throat. Her hydration needs by using her divine art’s water are more than sufficient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While observing the exterior of the castle with Ellen on his side, Falma inquires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is this Mont Saint-Michel[2]… what is this place in the middle of the sea?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hugo’s  residence  is  reminiscent  of  a  maritime  fortress.  It’s  a  small  island  which appears to be floating on the sea with the fortification of high walls that surround the whole  place.  The  parts  of  the  castle  resemble  the  towers  within  the  island  is  a complicated high-rise building. One can see the gun/guard turrets on the gate’s walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is  only  one entrance/exit,  which  composes  a huge  and  wide  main  gate  that connects to the mainland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The location is surrounded by the water for defense. The divine arts used for defense are connected to the various divinities of the various gods.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen explains while gulping down the water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma recalls that the mansion of the De Medicis’s family also faces the river in the same manner, and the residential’s herb garden is on a sandbar of the river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who are the gods of this place?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">He wonders about it since she didn’t elaborate earlier, then Ellen goes into details about the divinity arts assembly at this place. It has been known that the divine arts of this place automatically activate by using the enchantments and divine powers in the form of figurines, with certain characteristics and activation conditions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">It’s like the usages of magic circles. </i>) Falma roughly comprehends the explanation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you set up a divinity arts assembly in advance, it can detect the intruder immediately that doesn’t enter through the main gate and automatically attacks with water-based divine arts. The mansion of the De Medicis family also has a similar layout.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that so? It’s quite convenient.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">Do Salomon and others use similar variations for their own needs? </i>) Falma recalls his first meeting with the Inquisitors sent by Salomon that he battled with, as they also set up similar traps in the form of the divinity seal that turned out to be pretty brutal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So then, should we go through the main gate?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">It will be pretty awkward to attempt a break-in and get caught in the act by the divine arts assemblies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s the only way. Otherwise, we’ll fall into the divine arts assembly’s traps like preys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, aren’t we arriving much earlier than the letter sent out by Falma-kun?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  is  an  imperial-owned  postal  service  in  the  Imperial  City,  and  his  letter  was routed in the morning by delivery staff. Since the express mail is exclusively used by the great aristocrats for its delivery, the delivery time can be calculated accurately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I based my calculation on the delivery and his reading time of the letter.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This will not give Count Hugo any time to escape.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Ellen’s spine feels frozen due to Falma’s lack of sympathy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  two  approach  the  main  gate  of  the  maritime  fortress  on  foot  so  as  not  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">suspicious. As Falma approaches the castle, he senses something unpleasant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">This odd feeling, I shouldn’t worry about it. It’s quite dense though. </i>) While pondering about what he is sensing, Falma holds a voice amplifier and calls out to the two standing and weary guarding gatekeepers. Hugo’s fortress seems to be on the alert, as many of the guards are gathering along the walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello there. Although the letter was delivered earlier, I’m sorry for the sudden visit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My name is Falma de Medicis of royal court pharmacist. May I meet up with Count Tre moï lle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The owner of this place is currently not here.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gatekeepers are surprised to hear that the boy is a court pharmacist and reply politely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I understand. When will he return?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We only know that he will be away for a while.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the response about the Count being away for a long period of time, he pretends to retreat from the place for now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It can’t be helped, so I’ll come back again a little later.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gatekeeper’s faces show signs of relief. Falma hears a faint noise in the distance and glances up at the towering fortress. He grabs Ellen’s hand then sends his divine power into the Medicine God’s staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is something wrong?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen inquires of Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma takes hold of Ellen and leaps directly into Hugo’s room through the half-opened window. It happens so fast that the gatekeepers can’t see what just transpired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What happened just now?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">The two gatekeepers look at each other in puzzlement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wua aaah !!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hugo is surprised by Falma’s intrusion from an unexpected distance, leaps up and makes a strange utterance, runs toward the wall of the room, then collides with it and collapses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good day, Count Tre moï lle.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma greets the Count. Hugo attempts to escape, but Falma stands in front of the door and blocks the escape route. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wh-what is the meaning of this!?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hugo is already in tears when he’s staring at Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As I have stated in my letter to you, I simply have a few questions. You were looking at us from the opened window. If you truly were absent from your place, you shouldn’t look at us, as we would notice you.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma retains Bruno’s advice in mind while speaking to Hugo, making sure to be polite and allowing all of the past events to be flushed away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tha… that I understand, so…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hugo is stunned with fear and has no additional word to utter. Even Ellen is afraid of Falma’s tenacity, where Hugo is no match for him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…Then state your visitation for me!“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">While cradling his trembling head in his hands, Hugo feels the bump on his forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma feels apologetic and replies, “As I have written in my letter, please don’t be afraid of my visitation today.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know you’ve paid your pennant to the deceived alchemists, so I’ve accepted your deed, and I’m not reporting it to Her Majesty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma has come to visit Hugo to verify if it’s true, as it was rumored that Hugo has </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">suffered a mental breakdown. When Falma scans with his divine eye, he sees a light blue light in Hugo’s brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Acute stress disorder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma’s initial diagnosis is dead on. The most worrisome part is that Hugo has developed an  acute  stress  disorder.  An  acute  stress  disorder  is  a  stress  reaction  such  as  a flashback of prior experience, resulting in avoidance behavior, and hyper-awakening disorder that appears after suffering from severe trauma. Hugo panicked when he saw Falma and suffered from serious insomnia thereafter. If this condition persists for a long period of time, it may develop into PTSD[3]. When it comes to self-reliance, Falma is not trying to discipline Hugo to the point of him not being able to recover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hugo’s  pharmacology  skills  are  not insignificant,  and even  though  he  retired  once before, he can still return to be the royal court apothecary as it’s quite a shame to retire completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At this moment, I’m asking for you to please forgive me…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hugo  surrenders  his  composure  in  tears  in  how  to  respond  to  Falma’s  request  of forgiveness. Falma wonders if he will be forced to apologize to Hugo for the rest of his life, and it makes him shivers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As of today, I think you’ve been disciplined enough, so I believe it’s time to reopen your divine vein. You will not be able to hide the loss of your divine power from people around you forever.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">This may be the reason why even the gatekeeper hid the facts as Hugo retreated into the fortress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The reason I’m here is to ask, what is the purpose of your scam? If you’re honest with your answer, I’ll gladly reopen your divine vein.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma places a conditional clause for his offer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…the purpose of the philosopher’s stone.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your philosopher’s stones were all fakes.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen quickly interjects her statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanted to find out if anyone else possibly had synthesized the philosopher’s stone.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hugo presents his story to Fama. He initial y heard various stories about the synthesizing of  the  philosopher’s stone  among  alchemists in the  Imperial City.  He gathered the masses into one location who were interested in the philosopher’s stone. If there was anyone who had truly synthesized the philosopher’s stone, that person would deem the philosopher’s stones belonging to the alchemist Herme s were fake, and he would come into contact with the person who rejected them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre3">I don’t know what he’s trying to say, but for this…)</i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why were you looking for such an alchemist who could synthesize the philosopher’s stone  in  such  a  roundabout  way?  Do  you  really  think  such  a  philosopher’s  stone actually exists?“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma becomes more confused as they converse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is possible to synthesize the philosopher’s stone, but there is an involvement of great danger in synthesizing it.“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hugo presents his argument with a convincing tone, while gulping down the bottle of wine within his reach. During this time, there is no lying in his intonation. </p>
