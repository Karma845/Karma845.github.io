<h2>Chapter 15 &#8211; Reconstruction Efforts</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I woke up the next day, it was already past noon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew I was pretty tired, but I didn&#8217;t expect it to be this bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered if the others were already up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I left the room, I bumped into Finne.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good morning, Haruto. You sure slept like a baby.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, looks like I had a very deep sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, you did look pretty tired last night after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I did?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was trying not to show it on my face though&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. I&#8217;ve been with you for a while, so I can tell.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it would appear that Finne had already caught on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And it wasn’t just me, you know? We all knew.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that why Iris and the others went to their assigned rooms immediately without pursuing the matter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For real. Somehow, I feel bad taking advantage of your considerations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry about it. More importantly, you must be feeling hungry, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne said, &#8220;Please follow me,&#8221; after I nodded and led me down a corridor that led to the outside of the cathedral. As we stepped outside, I saw that there was a garden area where rations were being distributed. This was for the people whose homes had been destroyed in yesterday&#8217;s battle. Apparently, there were other casualties besides the demon-summoning victims, and a separate memorial service was being planned for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m about to eat as well, would you like to join me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shall we? What about the others?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked, it seemed that everyone else had been helping with the reconstruction while I was sleeping, and they were all busy helping out where they could. I felt guilty for being the only one still sleeping. Maybe my thoughts showed on my face because Finne smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, you&#8217;ve done more than your fair share, so please don&#8217;t worry about it. Besides, now it&#8217;s our turn to do something since we haven&#8217;t been able to do anything yet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you, hearing you say that does make me feel better.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we talked and went to get our rations, we saw Ilmina there helping out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, you’re awake.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, I barely woke up. I’m sorry for sleeping in and not helping.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I tried to apologize, Ilmina shook her hands at me, flustered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not at all. After you saved so many people, there’s nobody who could fault you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m glad to hear you say that. So, about the food distribution, I’d feel awkward taking it from those who need it more. In fact, please take this, as well,” I said, taking the food I had saved up out of my dimensional storage. There should be enough servings for about two hundred people. I had amassed this much by constantly stocking up on supplies and gathering monster meat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you sure we can have all of this!?&#8221; Ilmina yelled in awe. The other nuns also noticed it and stared in amazement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Absolutely, I have more than enough for my journey, so feel free to take it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you very much!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nuns all thanked me in unison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Finne and I finished lunch, we headed straight to the reconstruction work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area around the building where the demon summoning had taken place, where Finne had been helping out in the morning, apparently had enough people, so I decided to check out the other places. First, I went to the cathedral where I had been yesterday to see how it was, and there was Liebert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Liebert.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, Haruto. Did you have a good rest?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, thank you&#8230; What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were construction workers judging by their clothing who were deep in thought, so I asked what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, we were discussing how long it would take to repair the cathedral&#8230; And at this rate, it looks like it might take several months,&#8221; he replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s just going to take several months? Despite being that badly damaged, the workers were able to fix it in such a short amount of time? That seemed pretty fast already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it seemed like Liebert and the others wanted to fix it even faster. So I decided to ask Ellis if there were any skills or abilities that could restore buildings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Yes, there is, you need to use the [Reconstruction] skill. It allows one to rewind time in order to restore buildings within a 10-meter radius.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you believe there&#8217;s magic that&#8217;s perfect for reconstruction like this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The radius of ten meters is a bit limiting, but with this, we should be able to speed up the reconstruction process. I immediately went to relay this information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Excuse me, Liebert?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;About the cathedral, would you mind if I tried to fix it? I happen to have a skill that should come in handy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After considering for a moment, Liebert nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alright. Can you try fixing this section as a test?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure, just give me some space.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert and the others stepped back as I instructed. I held my hand over the collapsed wall and activated my reconstruction skill. The wall seemed to rewind like a video in reverse, returning to its original state. I was amazed that it just took a few seconds, but Liebert and the workers were even more astonished, their eyes wide open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s fixed in an instant… That&#8217;s incredible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a handy skill indeed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert and the others examined the repaired section closely and murmured in agreement. I then asked him a question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Would you mind leaving this part to me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure, we&#8217;d appreciate your help. If you don&#8217;t mind, could you tell us what kind of skill it is? I don&#8217;t mean to pry, but we&#8217;re quite curious since it restored everything so perfectly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm, it does seem like a time manipulation skill, and it might cause a commotion if word got out. I hesitated for a moment but decided to tell him, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, but only you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand. I won&#8217;t tell a soul.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alright then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert immediately asked the workers to step away, leaving just the two of us. I checked to make sure nobody was around, using my own skill, before telling him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The name of the skill I just used is called [Reconstruction].&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Reconstruction…?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He seemed puzzled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a skill that turns back time within a specific range, restoring things to their original state.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing my explanation, Liebert was stunned and speechless for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s a powerful skill. I&#8217;ve never heard of one that rewinds time like this. If people learn about it, it would cause a huge uproar. Now I understand why you wanted to keep it a secret. Thank you for sharing this with me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it. I&#8217;ll fix the cathedral, but I&#8217;d appreciate it if you could just say that I have a skill to move debris or build structures.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert bowed his head. He then explained the situation to the craftsmen and headed off to work on the other buildings. Now, the skill&#8217;s effective range is ten meters, and since the damage spans a wide area, it might take a while. With a determined look, I started my work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About an hour later, the work was nearing completion. I had finished the interior of the building, so only the visible exterior remained. Using the skill required focus, which was quite tiring. As I wiped the sweat from my brow, I heard a voice from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, you&#8217;ve worked hard.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s you, Ilmina.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing there was Ilmina, holding a cup and a water jug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I heard from my father that you&#8217;re fixing it, Haruto&#8230; You&#8217;re making progress so quickly!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina&#8217;s eyes were wide with amazement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But you&#8217;ve been working non-stop, haven&#8217;t you? How about taking a break?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um, you&#8217;re right. I think I&#8217;ll take a short break.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to follow Ilmina&#8217;s suggestion without any resistance. We left the cathedral and sat down in the shade of a nearby tree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Here you go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took the cup that Ilmina had filled with water and held out, gulping it down in one go, making my throat feel refreshed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How did you fix it so quickly? What kind of magic did you use?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we&#8217;re engaged now, there&#8217;s no need to hide anything. I honestly explained my skill, [Reconstruction], and Ilmina’s eyes widened even more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;S-So there&#8217;s a divine skill like that&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re exaggerating. It&#8217;s not that great; its effect range isn&#8217;t that wide.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I chuckled at Ilmina’s reaction, and she leaned in closer. A soft, floral scent tickled my nose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s not true at all! What you&#8217;re doing is amazing, Haruto! Be proud of yourself!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay! Calm down. I get what you&#8217;re trying to say!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really? Do you really understand?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, but your face is a bit too close.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I pointed that out, Ilmina quickly backed away, her face turning red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;S-Sorry! I didn&#8217;t mean to&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not that I dislike it, but we should be mindful of the people around us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to cover it up, but honestly, I was just embarrassed. My face was probably as red as Illmina&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alright, I should get back to work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stood up, trying to change the subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please do your best.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, and thanks for the water.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah! Y-Yes! Good luck!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina, smiling happily at my gratitude, rushed off. She was soon caught by a nun, around the same age as her, who seemed to have been watching us, her face flushed. Seeing this heartwarming scene gave me the energy to resume my work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oops, I think I overdid it&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the finished cathedral, I couldn&#8217;t help but mutter that. The cathedral&#8217;s appearance had not only been restored but had become as beautiful as if it were brand new. I had intended to clean up the entire structure beyond just the damaged parts, but this was the result. I wonder if I&#8217;ll get scolded later. Just as I thought of that&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, you&#8217;re done already&#8230; Huh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, good work and&#8230; What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert and Ilmina came out of the cathedral, their voices trailing off as they saw the restored structure. They were completely frozen. The knights and nuns, who came out to see what was happening, had the same reaction. After a few minutes, they seemed to finally understand the situation, and Liebert and Ilmina spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, was the cathedral always this divine and white&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, what exactly did you do?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nervously answered their questions, sweat beading on my forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I might have&#8230; overdone it a little. I was just trying to clean the dirty parts and patch up some small scratches, but it ended up like this&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing my words, both of them winced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even so, it does look incredibly divine, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ilmina&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s not just white, there&#8217;s something else, isn&#8217;t there? What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina and Liebert seemed to have noticed something. I intended to explain it to them later, but I decided to do so now and asked them to follow me. We went to the room in the cathedral where I had stayed the night before. And I showed them something on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Actually, I created a magical tool that can activate a barrier to protect the cathedral in case something like this happens again. It might be the reason it looks so divine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A barrier, you say&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of them seemed unsure. I picked up the actual magical tool and showed it to them while explaining. The tool looked like an ordinary cup, golden in color, with water inside. Without the Appraisal skill, one wouldn&#8217;t recognize it as a magical device.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is it. Though it&#8217;s stationary, by using it, you can deploy an anti-magic and physical barrier.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I handed it to Ilmina, she examined it hesitantly. Liebert, who was standing next to her, did the same. I continued with my explanation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is called the [Chalice of Guardianship]. As long as magical power flows through it, it can create an anti-magic and physical barrier that covers the entire cathedral. Do you see the water inside the cup right now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing my words, Ilmina and Liebert both nodded. The liquid inside was actually highly concentrated magical power. By pouring magical power into the chalice, it generates the water – magical water – from the bottom and fills up the chalice. This magical water is used to activate and maintain the barrier. When it runs out, the barrier disappears and the chalice turns silver. The barrier also has the effect of repelling monsters and demons below a certain level, so perhaps the divine appearance is due to that effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After explaining everything, both Ilmina and Liebert were stunned. But after a while, they seemingly accepted it but still asked hesitantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are we really allowed to accept such a thing?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s such a valuable item.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-performance magical tools were naturally valuable. That&#8217;s probably why they were hesitant to accept it. However&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can make another one if I want to and I don&#8217;t need it myself, so I want you to have it. Besides, it can only create a barrier for this cathedral.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really? Then, did you make this, Haruto&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina asked in astonishment, and I nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, but please keep it a secret that I can make such artifacts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;U-Understood. In that case, we gratefully accept.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina said this and bowed deeply along with Liebert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, Haruto, how much magical power do we need to pour into this chalice to fill it? And if we don&#8217;t replenish it, how long will it last?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, for me, it was a small amount, but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, I think an ordinary person would need a considerable amount of magical power to fill it. Ellis, what&#8217;s the actual situation?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Assuming your mana is 1000, the average magical power of a person who hasn&#8217;t trained it is about 1, perhaps 2 for someone with a little more. It requires about 50 mana to fill the chalice. Also, when filled, the barrier can be maintained for thirty days.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I had that much magical power&#8230; well, I guess it makes sense. Anyway, with one person&#8217;s entire magical power, the barrier can be maintained for about half a day. Considering the amount of magical power needed to activate a barrier of this scale, it&#8217;s quite cost-effective. I explained this to Ilmina and Liebert in an easy-to-understand manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To fill it from the bottom, around fifty people should pour all their magical power into it. If nothing is done once it&#8217;s full, the barrier will last for thirty days. If you have multiple people regularly pouring in their magical power, you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about it running out.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Understood. Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, I took out another sword I made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And this too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina asked as she looked at the silver short sword she received from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s the [Magic Sword of Restoration]. It&#8217;s a sword-shaped item that grants automatic repair capabilities to any building it&#8217;s stabbed into. However, once the sword is pulled out, it turns to sand and vanishes, so you can&#8217;t stab it again. Choose the location to stab it carefully.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. Understood.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As for where to stab it, I&#8217;ll leave that up to you, Ilmina.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, thank you. I was thinking of discussing it with my father…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon receiving Ilmina&#8217;s gaze, Liebert quietly nodded. It seemed that they had already decided on a location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was thinking of stabbing the sword in the center-front of the chapel, covering it with the altar, and placing the chalice on top.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, that sounds good. It&#8217;s easy to understand, and it should make replenishing the chalice with magic power easier as well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I nodded in agreement, Liebert stared at me with a serious expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, thank you very much for even providing us with something like this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, don&#8217;t worry about it. The restoration isn&#8217;t finished yet, after all… Well, I&#8217;ll head over to the place where everyone is still working.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for everything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert expressed his gratitude, and both he and Ilmina saw me off at the entrance of the cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, quite some time has passed, but it&#8217;s still too early for the day to end. I decided to head to the building where the demon summoning had taken place, where Finne had gone. On my way, various people in the city called out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for saving the capital!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re a hero of this country!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps people who saw my face at the cathedral garden yesterday had spread the word about my appearance and clothing. The words spoken to me were all expressions of gratitude, and I didn&#8217;t feel bad at all… In fact, I felt happy. So, I waved back at everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I walked for a while, I could see the remains of the building I had infiltrated yesterday. Many buildings around it had also collapsed. There, Finne, Iris, Suzuno, Ephyr, and Asha were working hard on the restoration. A little further away, I could see residents and carpenters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everyone, good job!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing my voice, Finne turned around, and Iris and the others stopped their work and came over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, is the cathedral restoration already finished?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, I fixed it to perfection and made some additional modifications.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You… made additional modifications?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne’s words felt somewhat awkward, or was it just my imagination?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, what exactly did you do?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t do anything that big.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I replied to Iris&#8217;s question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely &#8216;something big,&#8217; isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It must be, because it&#8217;s Haruto.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Suzuno and Ephyr are right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuno, Ephyr, and even Asha started saying that. Am I really that untrustworthy…? I was a little hurt, but I was aware that it was due to my daily behavior, so I couldn&#8217;t argue. Feeling the silent pressure from Finne and the others to talk quickly, I decided to honestly tell them. It would be exposed sooner or later anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The truth is—&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I explained to everyone what I did to the cathedral while fixing it. Then…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A barrier, huh? You&#8217;re always up to something absurd.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Like Finne said, creating a magical tool that can cover the entirety of the huge cathedral with a barrier is just outrageous!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a bit too much?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And it even has automatic restoration…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can just imagine the dumbfounded faces of His Holiness and Lady Ilmina.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne, Iris, Suzuno, Ephyr, and Asha all say this in unison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling uncomfortable, I decided to change the subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anyway, let&#8217;s start working on this quickly!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a bit too obvious?&#8221; Suzuno muttered under her breath, but I pretended not to hear her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re right about that. But even though we&#8217;ve moved the debris out of the way to make it easier to work, there&#8217;s no disposal site and the construction materials haven&#8217;t arrived yet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne said that, glancing at the collapsed building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with this level of damage, we can manage somehow&#8230; or rather, it was good that there was debris left due to the skill constraints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it&#8217;s only a matter of going back in time, if the original materials weren&#8217;t in place, we can&#8217;t predict what will happen. Well, if it comes to that, we&#8217;ll just acquire another construction-related skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, leave it to me. With the skill I learnt earlier, I should be able to repair all the buildings in the divine city, including this one, by sunset.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In just a few hours?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded confidently, and after moving everyone away, I started working immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I targeted the collapsed buildings and activated the [Reconstruction] skill, starting each one right after the last.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon witnessing the scene, Finne and the others let out exasperated noises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I thought so when I first heard about it&#8230; but you&#8217;re still incredibly unreasonable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Seriously.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone nodded in agreement with Finne and Iris&#8217;s conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The residents, too, had their eyes glued at the unbelievable scene, their mouths half-open, mesmerized by the unbelievable scene before their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work proceeded smoothly, and before the sun began to set, the entire Holy City was beautifully restored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With their homes back in order, the residents returned to their normal lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the way, we met up with Zero and Kuzel, who had been working in other areas, and waved goodbye to the residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did we&#8230; not really do anything after all?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne murmured after everything was done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wish she hadn&#8217;t said that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you all taking care of various things while I was asleep? Everyone was grateful, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Yes, that&#8217;s true.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne and the others nodded honestly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we returned to the cathedral, Ilmina and Liebert were waiting for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please, come this way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were led to a room, and when we took our seats, Ilmina and Liebert suddenly bowed their heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Once again, thank you for everything. As the pope governing this country, and as a representative of the people, I sincerely thank you all from the bottom of my heart.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to keep saying it, really.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No. No amount of gratitude is enough. We are all that grateful to you, Haruto.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I decided to accept their thanks gracefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The residents of the Holy City may still be inwardly shaken, but from tomorrow onwards, they&#8217;ll be able to return to their normal, everyday lives.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s also thanks to Finne and the others&#8217; help.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, everyone, thank you very much.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then a nun came to report that dinner was ready.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dinner seems to be prepared. How about continuing our conversation over a meal?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sounds great. I&#8217;m sure everyone else is okay with that too, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Finne and the others, and no one objected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were guided to the dining hall, where a long table with chairs and an array of dishes were waiting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as we took our seats, we began discussing stories from the Holy City that Finne and the others heard from the residents, the strange magic tools I had made, and other topics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of it all, I decided to reveal my true identity to Liebert and Ilmina after clearing out the room. I had missed the chance to inform them last night, as I couldn&#8217;t find the right timing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I thought that since I was a person from another world who would eventually return to my original world, my engagement to Ilmina might be considered void. However&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t care that Haruto is a person summoned from another world. I don&#8217;t need any reasons to like him,&#8221; Ilmina said with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Truly saintly&#8230;&#8221; Suzuno murmured beside me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn&#8217;t agree more. It felt as if I could see a halo behind her, like an illusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aah, rather, now I understand why Haruto is so strong. I can trust you with my daughter,&#8221; Liebert said with a grin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Iris unexpectedly asked, &#8220;Haruto, are we departing tomorrow or the day after?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um, honestly, either is fine. Is there something going on?&#8221; I replied, noticing Ilmina&#8217;s slightly wistful expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Iris turned to Liebert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Your Holiness, may we allow Ilmina to go out with Haruto alone tomorrow? I believe we won&#8217;t be able to return here for quite a while after we leave this country.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina&#8217;s eyes widened at her words. &#8220;Iris!? What are you saying!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Would that be fine with you, Finne and the others?&#8221; Iris continued, disregarding Ilmina&#8217;s outburst and seeking confirmation from Finne, Suzuno, and Ephyr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a good idea for them to go out alone,&#8221; Finne agreed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel the same as Finne. It&#8217;ll be lonely not seeing each other for a while,&#8221; Suzuno added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I agree with Iris as well,&#8221; Ephyr concurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them nodded in agreement with Iris&#8217;s proposal. It seemed like there were no objections, and in fact, they all seemed to think that it was a good idea. Iris then turned to Liebert and asked him, looking at Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Iris asked Liebert, he looked at Ilmina. &#8220;What do you want to do, Ilmina?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8230;&#8221; Ilmina looked down for a moment before raising her head and staring at me. &#8220;It&#8217;s true that I&#8217;ll be lonely if I can&#8217;t see Haruto. So, just as Iris suggested, or rather, personally, I want to go out with Haruto tomorrow!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert nodded quietly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In that case, enjoy yourselves tomorrow. Haruto, I will entrust my daughter, Ilmina, to you for tomorrow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure, you can count on me. Ilmina, let&#8217;s make the most of our day together tomorrow,&#8221; I said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes!&#8221; Ilmina replied with a beaming smile.</span></p>
