<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Opening with a Bang!</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">——Early in the morning on the day of the opening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I came to the store with Finne, Iris, Asha, Kusel, Ephyr and Suzuno to help with the preparations in the early hours of the morning when it was still dimly lit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others had not come to help out at the store because they were returning to Glicente soon and wanted to spend time preparing and training for their return. Suzuno came along because she had decided to stick with me from now on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought Kusel would be training with Tendo and the others, but instead she was like, “I&#8217;m not familiar with this kind of business, so I want to learn as much as I can”, and came along as well. Now I&#8217;m a little worried because she’s a musclehead, but then again, I’m glad that she&#8217;s willing to learn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the fate of the Ashtaroth Chamber of Commerce will be decided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve done a good job of advertising, and the morale of the employees is over the roof.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all the preparations were complete, I gathered the employees together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked around at all the employees, who were neatly lined up in a horizontal row.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now then. Today is the D-Day of our Ashtaroth Chamber of Commerce.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone nodded at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The flyers had a positive effect, and a lot of people are already anxious to buy. Today&#8217;s sales will be limited to two hundred for the nobles and three hundred for the low-priced version, with a limit of three units per person. The nobles will also come to participate in the sales, but there is no need for us to change our attitude——any questions?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One employee raises her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. If someone uses violence or force, how should we deal with them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, it won’t be surprising if some were to resort to extreme measures.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-40932185' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-40932185' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In such a case, there is only one thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fight back. Don&#8217;t kill them, but turn them over to the guards. But if you notice any intent to kill from them, make them pay for it later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““Sir, yes sir!”””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my words, the employees bowed their heads in unison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a refined movement, like that of a well-organized army.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne and the others were muttering, “What was that flawless movement&#8230;”, but I pretended not to hear them!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good, now let&#8217;s begin the final preparations!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““Yes sir!”””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The preparations went smoothly a few minutes before the opening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A line of people had formed in front of the store, waiting for the store to open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were not only commoners, but also people who looked like messengers of the nobles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, there were even horse-drawn carriages, probably belonging to the nobles who had come to participate personally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a few employees maintain the line&#8230;still, a problem arose right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Guide me up to the front! I’m a noble!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard the voice from the back of the line.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked over and there he was, a fat piggy——I mean, a fat middle-aged man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where is the one in charge of this business? Hey maid, I am a viscount!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The employee who got yelled at calmly took care of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The others in line kept their distance, as if they wanted no part of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am sorry, sir. In our company, we consider all of our customers equal, regardless of whether they are nobles or commoners. So we cannot give special treatment to any one customer, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid bowed politely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if he was the type to simply nod and accept such courtesy, he would not have made a fuss in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A commoner with such a high and mighty attitude! By flexing my power a bit, I could crush this business with nothing but a thought! Now take me to the front of the line!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Viscount Piggy, who had been making a lot of noise, suddenly closed his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, he noticed the intimidation I had unleashed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walked up to the Viscount piggy, whose face had turned pale and trembling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shut the fuck up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing those words, the Viscount piggy’s complexion changed from blue to red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that his anger had overtaken his fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You pleb, do you know who I am? You think you can get away with such behavior towards——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just told you to shut your trap, are you deaf? You may be a viscount, but your status has nothing to do with my business&#8230;You claim to be a noble and you don&#8217;t even know who runs this store, much less who I am?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said and took out my adventurer&#8217;s card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The adventurer&#8217;s card I took out was jet black in color. The letters on it read ‘EX’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Viscount piggy’s face not only turned blue, it went completely pale, when he saw it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-No friggin’ way, the pleb——I mean, you are that EX rank adventurer, the Demon King Haruto&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Da fuck you calling Demon King?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I involuntarily made a snappy retort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customers in line were also saying, “Oh, so that’s the infamous&#8230;”, and “So It&#8217;s true that it&#8217;s the Demon King&#8217;s store&#8230;”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nah, I gotta hold it in, hold it in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I changed my mind and stared at the Viscount Piggy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So I heard you were going to crush my store huh? Enlighten me please? A trading company that got approved directly by His Majesty?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His Majesty&#8217;s direct approval&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying that much, the Viscount piggy finally understood the situation completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He got down on his knees and bowed his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He seemed to be trying to prostrate himself, but his stomach was so tight that he could hardly assume the accurate posture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I beg your forgiveness!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-34661373' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-34661373' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, as long as we’re on the same page, we good. Join the line like everyone else, or go home if you feel it beneath you——sorry for the inconvenience everyone. We will be opening momentarily. We appreciate your patience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was bowing to the other customers, I saw the Viscount piggy slinking away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customers called out to me, &#8220;Yo, Demon King!”, or &#8220;You are the greatest adventurer!”, I went back inside the store while protesting in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, it was time to open the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you all for your patience. We are now open for business. For the next four days, we will be having an opening sale, offering discounts on a variety of items. Please stop by and see if there’s anything you fancy!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Benak signaled the opening of the store, the customers trooped in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there, the crowd went wild. Various items were selling like they were disappearing, probably because they were on sale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four hours after the store opened, and even after 13:00 in the afternoon, there was no end to the number of customers. All the toilet seat quotas for the day were sold out, and the number of other items was steadily decreasing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After another four hours, the store closed for the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today’s sales have finally come to an end. Tomorrow we will start selling again at the same time. Please come back again!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Benak’s announcement, the customers were leaving the store as we closed for the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was so hectic that it was hard to take a break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gathered everyone together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good work, everyone. As expected, or rather more than expected, we had a great turnout. We had some pre-opening problems and a few other minor things, but I think we got off to a great start. It’s all thanks to every one of you. Let&#8217;s keep up the good work for the next three days!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““Yes sir!”””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After my speech, we began closing up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Finne, with a big smile on her face, spoke to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good work today, Haruto. The whole place was packed the entire time!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It sure was. But it’s only just begun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Exactly, Finne. We&#8217;ve only just begun!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris said to Finne, puffing out her chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am thinking, why has she been acting all high and mighty? She’s been getting more and more carried away ever since Asha complimented her saying, “The princess also did a lot of work behind the scenes”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel on the other hand&#8230;whoa, she was so exhausted that she fell asleep on the chair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was so cute that it made me laugh, then Suzuno tapped me on the shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come on, I gotta say, that thing is nothing but a cheat in this world&#8230;the customers were all like. ‘The Demon King is a devilish genius!’, and were all grinning thinking that you came up with it all on your own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As long as it brings in the dough. Besides, the only people who know the source of the idea for the product are my classmates, and no one else in this world can make it. Anyone would rejoice if they found out about this bad boy, much less complain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well yeah, but it just seems so petty&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuno looked at me dumbfounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think I said anything wrong though~.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we were having this conversation, Finne spoke to me.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s up, Finne?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That noble&#8230;I’m just wondering if it’s okay to leave things as is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe Finne is referring to the Viscount piggy from this morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You think he’s going to try something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. Although nothing happened today&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, Finne’s concern is well-founded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In that case, since I&#8217;m going to deliver the goods to Dillan tomorrow, I&#8217;ll inform him of the matter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll take care of it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I patted Finne’s worried head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Iris witnessed it and asked me to pat her as well&#8230;before I knew it, Suzuno, Ephyr, and even Asha joined the party of head patting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After closing of business on the second day, I visited Dillan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I reported to him about the Viscount piggy, whom Finne had been worried about, and he immediately seemed to know who I was talking about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That guy, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t even mention his name, you mean you could make him out from just his description alone&#8230;has he done something similar in the past?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, his name is Bhuta Berkshire. The Berkshire house have always been very wealthy for a viscounty, and it seems they&#8217;ve been sneaking around behind the scenes, but I haven&#8217;t been able to find them out on what exactly&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s quite a feat that even the royal family can&#8217;t get anything on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of which, so his actual name is piggy*. (TLN: Bhuta is pronounced same as pig)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. I&#8217;ll keep an eye out for him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, and if he does try anything, report it to me. I’ll nail him right away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gotcha.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that was that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I discussed this with everybody and they all agreed that he would likely try something nine times out of ten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, it&#8217;s quite a hassle, but&#8230;I will manage as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇ ◇ ◇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hurry up and do something about that trading company!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the dimly lit room, seven hooded shadows surrounded a round table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the men tapped on the table.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-37873440' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-37873440' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You keep saying that~&#8230; but, destroying a trading company that has the backing of His Majesty is no walk in the park.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The products are of high quality, but the prices are also high and fair. The fact that they are not selling at a lower price than they need to is a sign of consideration for the businesses around them, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought I&#8217;d take a wait-and-see attitude for the past week, but their opening sale has cost me dearly in sales.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s only temporary, right? Besides, those toilet seats were very comfortable to use. If they market that product up front, I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;ll become a large trading company in no time&#8230;if that happens, they&#8217;ll branch out into other businesses, which will surely get in our way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I agree. That thing is way too groundbreaking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once you use it, you&#8217;ll never want to go back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you lot buy as well? You know what, forget it. Would somebody please do something about that trading company!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man from earlier tapped on the table, and a dang sound echoed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Calm down, young man. The founder of that trading company is an EX rank adventurer. His Majesty aside, any bad move, and we will be the ones crushed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ughhhh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man clenched his fist tightly and the room fell silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then one of them opened his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Let&#8217;s use the assassination group, ‘Cobra’. They are good at what they do, and even though the target is an EX rank, he will not always be on guard, so they are likely to succeed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh! That&#8217;s a good one!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hooded men started buzzing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But they were ignorant of one fact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Cobra had previously sent several of its members to assassinate Princess Iris, but they were repelled by none other than Haruto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, despite the fact that the survivors were underlings, they did not give up Cobra&#8217;s name or the name of their employer, so Haruto and the others were unaware of Cobra&#8217;s existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Cobra is wary of Haruto and sees him as an enemy, and they are bent on revenge and will do everything in their power to crush him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the hooded men, who were blissfully unaware of such things, looked at each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Then who would submit the request?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long silence. But then a young man broke it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll do it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;You will. Then, you make sure they don&#8217;t find out about us. Got it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the information leaked out, they would likely end up dead. They knew that much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As soon as I’m done with the preparation, I will carry it out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay. The enemy is the most powerful adventurer. Be very, very careful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All rose from their seats, raised the swords at their waists to the center, and spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““““““May the calamity of death befall those who stand against us!!”””””””</span></p>
