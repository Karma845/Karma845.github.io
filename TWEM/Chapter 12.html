<h2>Chapter 12 &#8211; Another World</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment the magic circle appeared, Schwartz shouted clearly,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Hell Flame!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black flames spiraled up from the magic circle at Haruto&#8217;s feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the time being, I protected myself with Aegis, but&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These black flames won&#8217;t go away until the target is consumed. Now, how are you going to deal with it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muddafucka, how do I deal with this now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I pondered on this, I heard Schwartz&#8217;s voice again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now then, how about I add something extra to the mix——Endless World!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the presence of the holy city that should have been directly below me, vanished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;No, it seems I was transported to a completely different space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used time-space magic to stop the time of the magic circle at my feet and the black flame that clung to Aegis, and sealed it in another dimension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this, the threat of the black flame was gone, but all I could see was complete darkness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Think you can break out from my world?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard Schwartz&#8217;s voice coming from the depths of the darkness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, we’ll see about that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My world, as in&#8230;could this be another world he created?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While wondering about this, Ellis answered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;This is a world created by Schwartz that exists in another dimension.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that&#8217;s how it is after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;It seems that in this space, Schwartz&#8217;s physical abilities and magic power are amplified. The current Schwartz may possess the same level of strength as master’s in your current state, so I do not recommend fighting here.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm. In that case, I&#8217;d very much like to find a way to escape somehow&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I was thinking about this, my detect presence and detect danger skills reacted. The direction was right beside me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I caught the approaching Schwartz&#8217;s claw with the arm I applied Diamond on and struck with the other arm, but didn’t feel like I landed the hit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, I heard Schwartz&#8217;s voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That really surprised me. I didn&#8217;t think you could react to a blow like that under these circumstances. Could it be that you can see me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, something like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz&#8217;s voice came back, “Oh”, as if he were surprised or impressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be precise, I’m not seeing with my eyesight, but rather grasping the entire space with detect magic, detect presence, and the map function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to these, the place where he’s standing is——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is this a city of ruins&#8230;? Is this world storing these ruins?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right, the entire place was in ruins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, compared to the current Perdis Kingdom or the Holy State of Belifaire, the structure of the buildings look a bit old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a building in the center of the city that looks like a castle that has collapsed in some places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I heard Schwartz&#8217;s voice, sounding a little excited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a shame, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;a shame?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s he talking about?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m in fact standing in the middle of a city in ruins. That much I can tell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Schwartz elaborated,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This place holds all the countries I have destroyed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing those words, it finally made sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, Schwartz had the title of ‘Destroyer of Nations’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I widened the scope of the map and couldn’t believe what I found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, there were several ruins, not just the one I was standing in the middle of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I can’t believe you destroyed so many countries!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah well, the ones who summoned me ordered, ‘Destroy our enemy&#8217;s country’. I remember some having heroes in their ranks, but that didn&#8217;t stop me from destroying them altogether. Oh, and trust me, I made sure to collect my dues for destroying these countries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz licked his lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I simply replied, “that so”, and glared at Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, but you don’t have to worry. The holy city and everyone in it are safe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I couldn’t take his words at face value, Schwartz explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Time passes differently in this world than it does back in your world. No matter how much time you spend here, it only amounts to a moment outside.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Oh I see, so in the end, I still have to kick your ass to get out of this world, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You got that right. So you’d better give it your best shot!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these words, I felt a presence that was even greater than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had at most twenty minutes left with Limit Break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I braced myself and approached Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in an attempt to intercept me, Schwartz swung his sword at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, so you&#8217;re able to deflect it, huh? A strike containing my full strength&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz looked surprised but elated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I asked Schwartz while evading his sword,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t help but notice that you look somewhat happy?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You bet I am, or rather, excited!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz continued to speak amidst the sparks from the clash of his sword and my blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the Demon Realm, where we devils live, strength determines everything. But the majority are weak. I found myself reigning as one of the strongest, and all the devils below me submitted and stopped challenging me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz recounted, sounding truly bored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If no one challenges you, then isn’t that a good thing? Since no one is causing you any trouble.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve got that wrong. The nature of us devils is one fraught with strife. We’re all about fighting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Is that so!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I swung my sword sideways to catch Schwartz by surprise, cutting him in half.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there was no feedback and his figure faded away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tsk, an afterimage&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after, his presence appeared behind me, and as I quickly crouched down, his sword passed over my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your reaction speed is as ridiculous as ever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I continued to dodge his attacks that unfolded from there, adjusting my stance, and firing a series of fireballs at his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mmh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz leapt backward to avoid being hit by the fireball, a beginner-level magic, and unleashed his magic to cancel it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A roar echoed through the pitch-black world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I didn&#8217;t expect you’d put that much magic power into a fireball. It looks even more powerful than poorly executed advanced magic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz muttered in admiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s hard to believe you’re human, don’t you think? Even I, a Demon Lord, cannot see through the depths of your magic power.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll take that as a compliment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is. Your capacity is even larger than us devils. So, I genuinely and sincerely respect you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. In that case, would you mind leaving this country alone?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufufuu, no can’t do. I have already received the compensation after all. And not once have I ever failed to fulfill a wish.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Schwartz finished saying this, he pressed closer to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s all right, since I cut off his left arm earlier, this guy should only be able to attack with his right hand, that is, from the left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, I took a defensive stance, but the next attack came from the right side as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly jumped back, but perhaps because I was surprised, my reaction was a little delayed, and blood seeped from my side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyzing his presence carefully, I found out that his left arm, which was not there just a moment ago, was beginning to regenerate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm.&nbsp; What? Is it that surprising that my arm is regenerating?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, it sure is. How exactly did you do it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not tellin’.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thought as much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason he didn’t attack with it till now despite having healed it up to this point is most likely to catch me off guard like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was thinking about this, Schwartz must have noticed that my wounds were healing with my Auto Healing skill, and he said curiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How did you heal yourself without using recovery magic?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I ain’t tellin’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufufuu, I suppose not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz seemed rather convinced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if he also has a means of recovery, moreover, something that can regenerate his left arm that was completely detached, it’s going to be even more difficult to defeat him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I braced myself again and confronted Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Darkness Line!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Aegis!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I defended against Schwartz&#8217;s attack, which cut off everything, with my barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz quickly closed the distance, and when I swung my blade, a high-pitched sound rang out, and then an exchange of swords ensued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflicting wounds on each other and then getting healed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no end to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can you do me a favor and just drop dead already?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You took that right out of my mouth. To think that there’s actually someone who could drive me against the wall in this world. It’s really making my blood pump!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This perverted battle maniac, what are you? Kusel’s twin?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do the inhabitants of another world love to fight so much?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Nah, among my classmates who were summoned as heroes, there were those who seemed to enjoy fighting quite a bit. Is this some kind of otherworldly culture or something?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a silly thought crossed my mind, but I regained my composure and asked Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why do you want to fight so badly?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As I said before, it&#8217;s our nature!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I frowned at his answer, which wasn’t really an answer, and swung my blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t looking good, my body won’t be able to hold out for much longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in this world, as Ellis said, my strength and Schwartz&#8217;s were in a deadlock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that case, I had no choice but to destroy this world, this dimension I am in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Explosion!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ughh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caught in the explosion, Schwartz was blown towards the ground and crashed into a pile of rubble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slash then came flying at me from the dust that was billowing up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I defended against it with Aegis, and then briefly sheathed my blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I quickly lowered my back and assumed the stance to draw my blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;You’re putting your weapon away in this situation?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz, who had returned to the air, didn’t attack me, perhaps wary of my suspicious behavior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I&#8217;ve had enough of this world already, so I&#8217;m letting myself out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufufu, sorry to say this, but it’s beyond you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll see about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I channeled magic power into the black katana and then drew it out in a single stroke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, since the slash wasn’t visible, it must have looked to Schwartz as if I had just waved my blade through the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you even——the hell?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz was tittering, but immediately afterward, a crack appeared in the dimension, and light permeated through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, that can&#8217;t be&#8230;no one can escape my world&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s ‘cuz of our level difference. Besides, you’ll do well not to underestimate my blade.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said to Schwartz, who sounded incredulous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crack gradually widened, and soon the darkness completely collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we stood in the air, we could see the holy city below us and the barrier I had put up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz still looked incredulous, but then he began to laugh, “fufufu”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t know what was going through his mind when he laughed, but I could sense that he was enjoying himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re certainly right, that weapon does have a shape unlike anything I’ve ever seen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s called Katana*. It&#8217;s a weapon from my country.” (TLN: Blade)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How fascinating. To think that after roaming around for thousands of years, there are still some things that I don&#8217;t know&#8230;it’s so fascinating.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz held out the sword in his hand to me and made me a proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you defeat me, you can have this sword. It’s a divine-grade* weapon. But if I win&#8230;” (TLN: It says God’s weapon)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, sure. If you win, you can have this blade.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufufu, thanks a bunch. Yet another reason for me to want to win even more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, both of us raised our magic power, and resumed clashing again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We struck each other again and again, and eventually Schwartz&#8217;s sword came close to my torso.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gotcha, it’s my——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz tried to finish up, but at that moment, my silhouette vanished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s just my afterimage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wha—!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved behind Schwartz in an instant, called out to him, and swung my blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz twisted his body to avoid it, but my aim was one step ahead of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if having homed in on him, the slash attack hit——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz&#8217;s left arm flew through the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz jumped back and let out a hushed sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t a cry of pain, but one of shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something misty like a black haze was leaking from the shoulder where he had been slashed again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz muttered somewhat happily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess this makes it the second time you&#8217;ve severed my arm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, it’s a rare experience isn’t it? ——Now, how about this last one as a parting gift.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I closed the distance in one breath to finish him off, but——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then I thought I heard Schwartz snicker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellis&#8217; impatient warning echoed in my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;It&#8217;s dangerous. Quickly back away!&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a magic circle glowing suspiciously at my feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A trap huh!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But by the time I realized it, it was too late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magic circle activated, and a black chain emerged from it and wrapped around my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I honestly didn&#8217;t think I would succeed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dammit, I must have let my guard down in my hastiness to win!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too. Never did it occur to me that you&#8217;d set up a trap in that split second.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, it’s really over! It’s been fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz, with a triumphant expression on his face, swung his sword downward and fresh blood flew in the air.</span></p>
