<h1>Chapter 11: The Magician Is Surprisingly Easy To Find</h1>

<div class="text-left">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We weren’t able to determine the cause.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arina-san and I were in the office, reporting the results of our patrol to Milena-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although we had encountered especially dangerous species and an abnormal number of demons, we were unable to uncover anything explaining the phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a grave expression, Milena-san picked up one of the magical stones lying on her desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A high density of demons and a chimera that shouldn’t be here… I just don’t believe that there isn’t some external cause. But if it really happened naturally, then there’s nothing we can do about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It might just be deeper in the forest. Oh, but we’re not going alone, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you want us to go again, give us a raise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arina-san and I firmly expressed our displeasure. I didn’t want to police the forest every day.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> We have our limits too, you know?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Increasing the size of the patrol would probably be more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Milena-san gave an understanding smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not such a tyrant. The other time was a direct order from the management. I don’t want to burden you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hope so…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sipped my tea with greater peace of mind.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m relieved.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I didn’t know what I would do if they had told me to go. Thankfully, Milena-san wasn’t the kind of person to abuse her authority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To be honest, the increase in numbers is only a matter of suppression…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Raize can do it from the palace. Problem solved.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, are you asking me to do it all by myself? Sniping them every morning is a lot of work, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t have the sort of self-sacrifice to take on everyone else’s burden. In my opinion, jobs are supposed to be equally delegated. Especially since court magicians are all paid the same salary.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, would you mind not casually recommending me like that? I’d appreciate it.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll try to figure something out, but I think we should proceed with the investigation in the meantime. Either way, we can’t leave it alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I agree. If we let demons as dangerous as the chimera roam around, it’ll affect traffic to the city.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Investigating the cause…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Milena-san tossed the stone she was holding onto the desk. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Shouldn’t you be taking better care of that?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s like doing a jigsaw puzzle without knowing what it’s supposed to look like. I have no idea where to start.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“About the chimera, could someone have brought it here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That can’t be true.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s right… There’s no way someone could have brought it from afar. Chimerae usually stay away from humans, and this one was especially ferocious. I knocked it out easily, but most people wouldn’t be able to scratch it. Not to mention I needed Arina’s help to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you can’t deny that there’s a possibility.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A question mark hung over my and Arina-san’s heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It exists, doesn’t it? A hidden power that makes the impossible possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her tone prompted us for an answer.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What? A hidden power… I’m drawing a blank.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“—Possession magic?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arina-san’s answer surprised me. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, of course she’d think of that.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Milena-san nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What if there were a spell that could multiply the monsters? Magic is deep. There are countless spells that we don’t know about, and maybe special magicians too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess Arina-san’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Earth Interference</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> would be an unreal experience for someone seeing it for the first time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s amazing, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Must you say so yourself? …Well, not that I can deny it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I’ve said many times, Arina-san’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Earth Interference</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is hyper-offensive. Within her range, I’d surrender immediately. Pride is cheap. I’d rather beg for my life than waste it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An owl hooted outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s late, so let’s stop here for today. I’ll see you two tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The pile of demons is still there in front of the gate, so they need to be collected. Maybe the Knights can do it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I buried the chimera. I’ll collect it later myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you going to use it for?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It looks interesting, even if it’s dead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Don’t do anything troublesome, either of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All I’m saying is that this should have been the Knights’ job in the first place, so they should clean up after us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They can’t stand up to us anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Milena-san, rubbed her temple and shot us an exasperated look. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">That look isn’t going to change how we feel. We risked our lives killing dangerous demons, so the least they could do is collect the dead bodies, right? </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grinned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You both look evil right now. I’m the one that’ll get in trouble if you guys do anything!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Milena-san pleaded with us, but it only made me want to mess around even more.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t worry. I won’t do anything strange… Probably.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the debriefing, I was on my way back to the boarding house. Engrossed in my thoughts, I walked through a hallway in the royal palace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Possession magic…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recalled Arina-san’s proposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If a possession magic user was involved, then why? What did increasing the number of demons accomplish?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it just to endanger those travelling to the royal capital? Or was there a deeper reason… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t think of anything. Even if I did come up with something, it would’ve been nothing more than a hunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I should stop thinking about this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my head in an attempt to clear my thoughts, but my mind kept running. At this rate, I wouldn’t be able to fall asleep. I needed to cool my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around and soon arrived at the most comfortable (according to my research) area of the palace: the courtyard at its center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn’t been here for a while, but the trickling fountain and trees swaying in the cool night breeze calmed me just as they used to. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a bit cold, but I’ll get used to it.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was late, so I was sure no one would come. Invisibility was unnecessary at this hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unbuckled my rapier and leaned against the edge of the fountain. Looking up, I stared at the stars twinkling in the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no better place to clear my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Fine Ice.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I invoked the magic lazily, without adjusting my posture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A thin white mist spread throughout the garden, suspending particles that shone in the moonlight.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Water Attribute Mid-Range Elementary Magic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Fine Ice.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This spell lowers the temperature in a certain area just enough to crystallize the moisture in the air. Offensively, it’s useless. It’s more of an entertaining party trick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But at the right place and the right time, the view it created was gorgeous. Crystals of ice shone like jewels and swirled around before melting against a surface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t really have a good reason to use it, but… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no point thinking about it this deeply. If anything happens, we can just crush them one by one—“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Found you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I snapped my head toward the voice. Cautiously, I sat up and held my rapier to my waist. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">At this hour? Who is it?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My eyes widened at the figure that appeared in front of me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cursed my stupidity for thinking I could relax for even a few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Long time no see. I finally found you—Raize-sama.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness greeted me with a devilish smile.</span></p>
