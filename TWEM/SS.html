<h3>Short Story &#8211; Asha&#8217;s Daily Life</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Asha. I am the personal maid of Princess Iris of the Kingdom of Perdis. I also work as a maid at the mansion of Iris&#8217;s fiancé, the EX-rank adventurer Haruto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, in addition to that, I am currently educating the slaves that Master Haruto purchased just the other day when he said he was going to establish a trading company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day, Mia, one of the maids in the same mansion, approached me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asha, can I leave today&#8217;s combat training to you? I&#8217;m not feeling too good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, I got it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowing her head, Mia went back to her room.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had already finished my tutoring as a servant this morning, so the only thing I had planned for the afternoon was combat training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I headed to the backyard where the newbies were waiting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before accompanying Master Haruto on his trips, I had no combat skills to speak of whatsoever and only did domestic work inside the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as I trained along Lady Iris during these trips, I became competent enough to instruct the newbies in this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My combat style is a guerrilla type, making full use of throwing knives and high-speed movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I do not possess a special attack or unique skill, but I damn sure won’t lose to your average monster or adventurer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the backyard, the newbies were already waiting for me, and when they eventually saw me, they bowed their heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““We ask for your guidance, Lady Asha!”””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m not so great that you put ‘Lady’ before my name though&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You over there, pay more attention to your surrounding! Keep that up and you won’t even know how you got done in!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-Yes ma’am.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They did some long runs, swinging, and light sparring to build up their physical fitness, and after a short break, a mock battle between the three newbies and myself began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was using the rubber knife specially made by Mr. Haruto. The blade is inked, so the area hit by the blade is colored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This made it easy for me to instruct the newbies on how to avoid the next hit, and I could tell that they were getting better and better at it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mock battle lasted for hours, and all the newbies collapsed from exhaustion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m still good to go, at the very least I haven’t run out of breath yet, but&#8230;I may have gone a little overboard, perhaps?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the kind of training I had with Master Haruto and the others wasn’t as gentle as this. And considering the level I want them to reach in the end, they are yet to even begin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked around at the faces of the newbies as I brushed the dirt off my maid&#8217;s uniform with my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Guys, if you keep lying down there you will get your clothes dirty. This is the end of today’s training, so take a bath and rest until it is time to prepare dinner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my words, the newbies got up and replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Sebas, the butler, appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asha, looks like you put them through the wringer, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I guess I really overdid it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Sebas fearfully as he looked around at the newbies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I let out a sigh of relief when he simply shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was afraid you would scold me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not going to scold you for this. You did it so they could become stronger&#8230;but please do it moderately, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood. I will.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I&#8217;ll leave you to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Sebas left, the newbies returned to the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I followed suit and began to walk slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve been very busy these days, but I feel very fulfilled because of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I returned to the mansion, the princess, who happened to be passing by, called out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just in time, Asha. Could you prepare some tea for me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course. I&#8217;ll bring it right away!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hurried to the kitchen to prepare a pot of tea.</span></p>
