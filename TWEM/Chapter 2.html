<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; The Heroes’ Labyrinth Raid</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—The day Haruto and his group departed from the royal capital, a little back in time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo, Ichinomiya, Mogami, Asakura, and Shinonome were on the 19th floor, the middle floor of the dungeon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to prior information, the dungeon was expected to have a total of thirty floors. Halfway through the dungeon, from the 15th floor, the monsters became stronger, making it difficult for even the best adventurers to advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the heroes had successfully reached that point, despite their struggles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And among them, Tendo&#8217;s party was at the forefront of the raid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aaarghh!!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Doryaa&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two level 60 monsters were defeated by the attacks of the three vanguards, Tendo, Mogami, and Shinonome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the coordination of Ichinomiya, who was in charge of recovery, and Asakura, who was in charge of magic attack, the five of them were able to attack without difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took them three days to reach the Nargadia Labyrinth after leaving the royal capital of Glicente, and four days to reach the 19th floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their raid speed was unbelievable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you think there are any stairs leading down?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo replied to Asakura&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I haven&#8217;t found it yet. We&#8217;ve been lucky so far, so we&#8217;ll just have to search slowly&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asakura said regretfully, but Ichinomiya tilted her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don&#8217;t look disappointed, Natsuki?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Was I found out? Actually, I like this kind of thing because it&#8217;s fun, like a game.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asakura, who doesn&#8217;t hesitate to call herself an otaku, said with a laugh, and Tendo called for attention.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Natsuki. Quite a number of adventurers have died in this labyrinth. So we need to keep our heads up as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sheesh, I know that much!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asakura puffed out her cheeks like a child and stuck out her tongue, causing the group to laugh at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere was cheerful, but they did not let their guard down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group&#8217;s current level was approximately 70. Which was quite high for a human considering that Kusel&#8217;s level was 64 when Haruto first met her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, all four of them, except for Tendo who has the holy sword Mistilteinn, had been given weapons by Haruto that he claimed are prototypes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weapons are not prototypes at all, but were first-class products that would make the craftsmen of this world swoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The level of the enemies in this floor was 60.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dungeon had a mid-level boss every five floors, and a powerful monster as boss monster every ten floors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boss battle on the next floor would be even stronger than the previous one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All five of them knew this, and so they kept their vigilance and tension intact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, after searching for the stairs for a while, Asakura finally spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There it is——‼&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Tendo and the others gathered, they found a hole hidden in the shadows and a staircase leading to the bottom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Found it at last&#8230;geez, how I wish it wouldn’t be so hard to find.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honestly&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo said disgustedly, and everyone nodded, including Ichinomiya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The party descended the stairs and sat down in front of the boss room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s take a break to prepare for the boss battle. What do you think guys?&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-44309225' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-44309225' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one objected to Tendo&#8217;s suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This floor only had the boss room, with no other monster in sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since this was not the case in the other floors, the party took turns resting, but their fatigue had reached its peak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After setting up their tents, eating, and cleaning themselves up, Tendo and the others took their time to rest for the first time in a long time. When they woke up, they began their strategy meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, as usual, Shinya, Aoi and I will be in the vanguard. Natsuki and Suzuno will be in the rear guard as support. That would be our formation. Since we can’t say for sure what&#8217;s going to happen, we will be relying on you two in the rear guard.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Leave it to us!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nodding at their reply, Tendo continued to explain the strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, Mogami and Shinonome would draw the enemy&#8217;s attention with their close-quarters attacks, while Ichinomiya and Asakura in the rear guard would take charge of recovery and guerilla attacks. The idea is to take advantage of the gaps in the enemy’s defense, to allow Tendo to release his powerful attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like I said earlier, we never know what&#8217;s around the corner. So be sure to keep your guards up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;““““Roger!””””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that voice, Tendo and the others stepped into the boss monster’s room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the boss’ room was a Minotaur that the party had defeated in the mid-level boss battle back on the fifth floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A Minotaur, here of all places?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ichinomiya replied to Mogami&#8217;s puzzled head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s something different about it. It&#8217;s bluish-purple in color, and it&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo said, following Ichinomiya&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, that weapon isn&#8217;t just some random axe, it&#8217;s some kind of magic sword. Moreover, even my appraisal couldn’t identify it and only displays as unknown. There&#8217;s something disturbing about it, and you can bet that it’s much, much stronger.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Tendo&#8217;s words, Mogami and the others, all four of them became visibly nervous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time as the Minotaur looked at Tendo and his party, the door slammed shut behind them with great force.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;—GUOOOOOOOHHhh!</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minotaur let out a roar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an intimidating roar that would make any normal person freeze up while pissing their pants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, contrary to the Minotaur&#8217;s expectations, Tendo and the others were calm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Intimidation huh, it&#8217;s nothing compared to Haruto&#8217;s.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, Haruto is amazing in many ways like that&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mogami, Asakura and Shinonome nodded as Tendo and Ichinomiya chuckled saying that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, all five of them were not letting their guards down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they were not as good as Haruto, they could tell that the Minotaur was a powerful enemy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was also in a different league compared to the monsters they’ve faced in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo was almost frightened for a moment, but then he reminded himself that he would not be able to move forward without defeating it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—Shall we?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Tendo&#8217;s words, the four of them nodded, their expressions tightening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the Minotaur thrust out its horns and charged forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It closed the distance in an instant, but even so, Tendo and the others were able to evade it without danger and prepared to attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—BUMOOOOO!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Minotaur braked and swung the battle axe in its hand at Mogami, who was about to attack it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotaur hurriedly distanced itself as Asakura&#8217;s magic hit it in the face, while Mogami braced himself for a direct hit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wow, not even a scratch! This Mr. Mino has such a strong defense!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mr. Mino&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You know, saying Minotaur is kinda of a drag and long.&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-83444911' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-83444911' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While listening to the exchange between the dissatisfied Asakura and Ichinomiya, who seemed like she had something to say, the vanguards, Tendo, Mogami, and Shinonome, readied their weapons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asakura applied a support spell that increased attack power and speed to the three of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh nice!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thanks, Natsuki!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, Natsuki!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them thanked Asakura and headed towards the Minotaur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotaur responded by swinging its battle axe, but it could not handle the simultaneous attacks of the three of them, and its body was gradually scarred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, when its strength had been reduced considerably, the atmosphere suddenly changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others took their distance at once and prepared themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They watched intently, trying not to miss the Minotaur&#8217;s every move—and then it made its move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotaur slammed its battle-axe into the ground with all its might, and the debris and stones that flew off the floor were flung away by the battle-axe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everyone, get behind me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four of them moved behind her as quickly as Ichinomiya instructed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Sacred Barrier!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sacred Barrier is a light magic that creates a hemispherical defensive barrier with a radius of two meters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time as its deployment, multiple fragments hit the barrier. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The barrier repelled the incoming attacks, and just as Ichinomiya was about to breathe a sigh of relief—a crack appeared in the barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““““Oh no?”””””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others all shouted in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they could not see it through the debris and smoke, the Minotaur had approached them before they knew it and was wielding its axe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The barrier that was struck by the battle axe gradually widened the crack with an unpleasant creaking sound, probably because the minotaur applied even more force.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ichinomiya was visibly upset when the strongest barrier she could use was about to be broken, but she quickly raised her voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll count to three, so fall back!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the sound of her voice, Tendo and the others prepared themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Three, two, one —now!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as the count was over, Ichinomiya broke the spell and the Tendo and the rest jumped back from the spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotaur, on the other hand, had been leaning forward with all its strength, and when the barrier suddenly disappeared, it lost its balance and thrust its battle axe into the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Tendo, Mogami, and Shinonome approached the Minotaur, and Ichinomiya unleashed her magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everyone shut your eyes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment Tendou and the others closed their eyes, Ichinomiya&#8217;s Light Magic, Flash burned the Minotaur&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—Boo-moooow!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotaur, which had lost its stance and vision, let out a cry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing Ichinomiya&#8217;s voice, Tendo and the others opened their eyes and immediately went on the offensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, Mogami uses all his strength to thrust his right fist at the Minotaur&#8217;s abdomen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Go to hell! You son of a b*tch!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotaur let go of its battle axe and fell to one knee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bmoooo&#8230;it made a pained sound, but still didn’t collapse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, Shinonome sheathed her sword once and approached with the fast movement skill, Ground Shrink&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She unleashed a swordflash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time as her blade loosened from its sheath, a blue-white lightning flashed around the blade, and the blade swung at ultra-high speed.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-98325081' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-98325081' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotaur&#8217;s right arm, from the shoulder up, fell off, but there was no blood. This is because the cut was burned by lightning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shinonome has fused the techniques she learned at her family&#8217;s dojo with the magic and skills of this other world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of those techniques, and by using lightning magic to speed up the extraction of the sword, and then applying lightning magic to the slash, it is possible to apply a burn effect, as in this case, or to shower it with electric shocks even if it is blocked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotaur groaned, but managed to get up and tried to pick up the battle axe with its left hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to stop it, Asakura cast an attack magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No you don’t! —Fire Wolf!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fire magic created flames in the shape of three wolves. They ran on the ground with such sense of movement as if they were alive, and bit into the Minotaur&#8217;s left arm and both legs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, more flames leaked from the wolves&#8217; mouths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just get burned to ashes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Asakura had said, the wolves that had taken a bite at the Minotaur began to burn fiercely as it clung to the minotaur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—BUMOOOOOOOOO!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotaur, its entire body burned and screaming in agony, swung its left arm as if it was trying to muster its last bit of strength, and the flames disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo immediately slashed at it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotaur tried to react as quickly as possible, but it couldn&#8217;t keep up with Tendo&#8217;s movements using both the Invincible skill, which the Holy Sword can only use once a day, and Ground Shrink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With this, it’s game over!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo leapt on top of the minotaur, wrapped the holy sword with holy magic, and swung it down with great momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time as Tendo landed, the Minotaur&#8217;s body split in half vertically and crumbled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A moment of silence fell over the place&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—We did it! We defeated it! We finally defeated it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asakura&#8217;s voice echoed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haa haa, phew, guess that finally did the trick&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo said, breathing heavily as his strength and magic power were severely depleted from the earlier attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We did it!&#8221;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s right!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we hadn&#8217;t defeated it, we would have been in trouble&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ichinomiya, Mogami and Shinonome shouted with joy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right. Since we defeated it! It looks like our level has risen, so let&#8217;s take a break and check it out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All four of them nodded at Tendo&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After checking each of their levels, Tendo and the others shouted in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t Suzuno and Natsuki&#8217;s level around 69 or something? Their levels seem to have gone up a few.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, maybe because it’s a boss monster, and they got all the experience points they needed from it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After taking a short break while talking about this, the party headed to the lower floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Is it just me or are the monsters that have been appearing for a while now as strong as the Minotaur&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s true&#8230;maybe because the next floor is the boss monster?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mogami tilted his head at Tendo&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group had reached the twenty-fourth floor over the course of a day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until the previous floor, the number of enemies had not increased, but they had gradually become stronger, but here on the 24th floor, in return for the number decreasing significantly, the power of each and every one of them had increased.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-85747556' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-85747556' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSc0JyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8aW5zIGNsYXNzPSJhZHNieWdvb2dsZSIKICAgICBzdHlsZT0iZGlzcGxheTpibG9jazsgdGV4dC1hbGlnbjpjZW50ZXI7IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtbGF5b3V0PSJpbi1hcnRpY2xlIgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtZm9ybWF0PSJmbHVpZCIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWNsaWVudD0iY2EtcHViLTY2MDk0NDIzMzgwODAxMTYiCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1zbG90PSI1NTg2ODE4NjUwIj48L2lucz4KPHNjcmlwdD4KICAgICAoYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgPSB3aW5kb3cuYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgfHwgW10pLnB1c2goe30pOwo8L3NjcmlwdD4=' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in the Royal Capital, they were impacted with knowledge regarding dungeons, and have even been in a few.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this was the first time they had seen such distribution of monsters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With irregularities like this, it would be better to take every precaution and challenge the mid-level boss monster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Tendo&#8217;s suggestion, they decided to take a rest in front of the mid-level boss room on the 25th floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, Tendo opened the door to the middle boss monster’s room and muttered to himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I knew it&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, the mid-level boss monster on the 25th floor would be about as strong as the one on the 20th floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Chimera in front of them was clearly much stronger than the Minotaur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pressure was overwhelming on Tendo and the rest of the party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something may very well be going on in this labyrinth in particular.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all nodded at Ichinomiya&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why this dungeon has suddenly become bizarre is probably due to the boss monster at the lowest floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s certain to be stronger than this middle boss, and I’m not sure if we can defeat it&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo shook his head and put that thought out of his mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, for now, we have to defeat this chimera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together with Tendo, who had readied his weapon, the heroes dashed towards the Chimera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—Two hours after the battle began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haa, haa&#8230;&#8230;fi, finally, we, won&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and his party won the fierce battle and were able to defeat the Chimera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Shinonome who dealt the finishing blow. This time, Tendo used his Invincible skill as a shield and she took advantage of the opening he created to send the chimera&#8217;s head flying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, battered and bruised from the battle, Tendo and the others were lying on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We somehow managed to pull it off&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“True&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought I was a goner this time&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too honestly&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was tough&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo, Ichinomiya, Mogami, Shinonome, and Asakura each shouted in exhaustion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, the five of them finally recovered and resumed their raid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That day, they reached the 28th floor, and the next day, they finally broke through the 29th floor and were standing in front of the boss room on the 30th floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So this is the last room&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seems like it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mogami nodded at Tendo&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Finally.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yea. It was quite the hurdle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wonder how many times I almost died.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asakura, Ichinomiya, and Shinonome muttered as they looked at the door in that order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo looked around at the four of them with a serious look on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We may very well die here. But&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a possibility that they could die here. Which was why Tendo emphasized it again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But, I&#8217;m not turning back now!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four of them nodded in agreement to his words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expression on their faces was full of determination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—They were determined to see it through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others put their hands on the door of the boss&#8217;s room.</span></p>
