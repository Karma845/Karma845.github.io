<h2>Chapter 2 – Is Maria a Heroine After All?</h2>
<p>After my duel with Tlue, I woke up on the bed of the medical office with bandages around my head. Maria, who was a nun, smiled kindly as I woke up.</p>
<p>She was cute, was she one of potential heroines?　</p>
<p>Also, my body hurts. Well, I figured that’d be obvious since I was beaten to pulp. To think that Tlue would trounce over me like that.　</p>
<p>I was beaten down so much, I was practically smashed all over. I couldn’t do anything to resist. On top of that, there was no awakening. It was so unsightly that I even doubted I was the protagonist.　</p>
<p>Hu-huh? I was supposed to be the protagonist, right?… I got a little worried. However, another boom of thunder clapped in my head once again!!　</p>
<p>—It was supposed to be a meaningful defeat. After all, it was sort of like a protagonist’s experience.　</p>
<p>That’s right! I had to think positively! I was the protagonist of the novel game, right? My character was even ranked first in the popularity poll! In that case, that defeat was supposed to have meaning. There was no way that the things I did in this world would be meaningless! I was the protagonist after all!　</p>
<p>In that case… I could think of a possible explanation. What happened earlier wasn&#8217;t an awakening event for the protagonist, but another kind of event instead.　</p>
<p>In other words, it was a losing event exclusive to the protagonist.　</p>
<p>So that was the case. Not even I could see through that despite being the protagonist myself. Well, this kind of event wasn’t a waste since it would lead to hints or become a stepping stone towards becoming stronger later on, so I guess getting wounded at this point was good.　</p>
<p>As for Tlue, he was definitely the cannon fodder character. He gave off such a scent.　</p>
<p>“Fay? Are you okay?”　</p>
<p>As I was thinking, the beautiful Sister Maria looked at me. She sure was a good person, seeing how worried and anxious she was.　</p>
<p>{“I’m okay. You don’t have to worry about my wounds.”}<span id="easy-footnote-1-19717" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-19717" title="T/N: this {} bracket means this was what the person meant to say, before being translated into Fay’s character’s speech. I don’t think you’ll see it often, but just to remind you."><sup>1</sup></a></span> </p>
<p>I meant to say that to reassure her. However…</p>
<p>“Obviously. These are mere scratches.”</p>
<p>“That’s definitely not the case Fay!”</p>
<p>As expected, what came out were haughty words. Fay was the cool type of protagonist after all.　</p>
<p>Sorry for this, Maria. Even though you were older than me. It’s just that being haughty came with the package in being the cool type of protagonist.　</p>
<p>“Fay, why did you suddenly begin to take up swordsmanship?”　</p>
<p>“Why, huh…”</p>
<p>Well, it’s because I was the protagonist. I needed to train myself to prepare for the inevitable… but there was no way I could say that.</p>
<p>But well, it was basically me trying to become stronger after all… Although I had no idea of what the plot of the novel game was, there were monsters known as Abyss, right? Then I guess the plot should develop around defeating these monsters…　</p>
<p>That was why I trained to become stronger… This should be easy to understand. So, I guess it was to defeat Abyss.　</p>
<p>“To reach greater heights. Also… to destroy Abyss.”　</p>
<p>“—…”</p>
<p>Perhaps Maria was about to yawn, or maybe she was so surprised that her jaw dropped, that she had to use her hand to cover her mouth.　</p>
<p>Even so, the speech gimmick was quite something. What I said ended up becoming a declaration. But I think, for one reason or another, that result would be achieved.　</p>
<p>It was common for a protagonist to have a grand goal after all.　</p>
<p>“I see… So you’re still…thinking about that time… No, you’ve been alone… yet you still remember. About that moment when your parents were gone.”　</p>
<p>Eh? Ah- I got worried about it for some reason, but I figured she would be concerned about the character known as Fay prior to me possessing him. I’m really sorry, but I don’t remember anything at all, and there was no sign of me possibly remembering it either.　</p>
<p>“It’s all in the past, I don&#8217;t remember at all. So don’t worry about it.”　</p>
<p>“…No, but there’s no way…gh. I see, I guess that’s just how it is.”</p>
<p>Even though I told her not to worry about it, she started being very worried instead. Ah, we shouldn’t stay like this. I couldn’t recall the memory, and yet Maria was still distressed about it.　</p>
<p>“…Aah, that’s why there’s no need for unnecessary worry.”　</p>
<p>“—gh…I see, you’re right. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Why are you apologizing? It’s not something for you to be concerned about.”</p>
<p>She looked really troubled for some reason so I felt really guilty about it. Maria sure was a good person…</p>
<p>“So, are your wounds alright? I’ll scold Tlue later…”　</p><div class="watas-ff414820f20117d78f48efc6171aac25 watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-ff414820f20117d78f48efc6171aac25"></div>
<p>“No, you don’t have to.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t like I was angry at him anyway. This kind of thing would only benefit me later on. After all, I was aware that no meaningless events would ever happen to me.　</p>
<p>I had guessed that these series of events would become some sort of hint for the future. I have also learnt of my current capabilities now, so I have to work even harder. It’s like some sort of fighting spirit emerged inside of me? I would acknowledge that I was defeated by Tlue, the cannon fodder who also seemed to be a mob character, and move on.　</p>
<p>Because I was the protagonist after all! I always needed the aspiration to improve! The world revolved around me. That losing event happened only because it was necessary, and I doubt anyone could’ve stopped it.　</p>
<p>As a result, it couldn’t be helped, and it benefitted me.　</p>
<p><strong>“Because I’m not angry about it. It allowed me to learn of my strengths and step forward to the future. For me, it was necessary.”　</strong></p>
<p>“—gh. I see, I guess that’s how it is… I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Ooh, so she was convinced by that. Maria smiled, then for some reason, she embraced me. Her soft bosom engulfed my chest. O-oi… that’s a dizzying stimulation for the virgin me in my previous life…　</p>
<p>“It’s alright. I will always be with you… Fay… I love you.<span id="easy-footnote-2-19717" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-19717" title="T/N: nope, no romantic meaning. As expected, Maria is not into shota… yet. E/N: could switch to ‘I care about you’ but it sounds even more romantic "><sup>2</sup></a></span>&#8221; </p>
<p>She whispered in my ears. That velvety smooth voice was dangerous. My ears felt like they were melting… Although I didn’t know why, perhaps it was like my body stiffening when it rains?　</p>
<p>Even so, it felt so soft. My heart pounded rapidly. My body froze as both I and my virgin heart scrambled in this situation. Maria was beautiful, kind, and smelled good. Moreover, she was willing to embrace me… Wasn’t it considered a common development for an orphaned protagonist to have a Sister type heroine who managed the orphanage?　</p>
<p>—Perhaps Maria really was the heroine.　</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>A woman held a worried expression as she sat by the tattered Fay&#8217;s side. She held onto the hand that was on the bed, worried that Fay wouldn&#8217;t be waking up yet, and offered prayers to god to grant a wish for his betterment.　</p>
<p>Her name was Maria. She was formerly active as a paladin, but she was now a Sister who set up an orphanage and took care of the orphans. She was a parent figure to Tlue, the protagonist of the novel game Round Table Heroes, and depending on the route, she could become the heroine.　</p>
<p>She took care of the children who had no families or were poor, for she had also lost her own parents to Abyss and the support of her family. She suffered from hunger then, but she managed to live on with help from various people.　</p>
<p>Due to her experience at that time, and the smiles of others she met during her days as a paladin, she thought of doing more for the people and searched for a way. As a result, she retired at a young age and set up an orphanage.　</p>
<p>She wanted to protect the children’s smiles, and this was the orphanage built from such a wish. However, what about <em>this</em> situation? The boy named Fay was wounded and had also never once laughed while in her care.</p>
<p>Fay was a boy that Maria had a hard time dealing with. He was snobby towards everyone, and never opened his heart up to Maria, even though every other child in the orphanage did.　</p>
<p>Naturally, Maria kept a distance from Fay.　</p>
<p>She couldn’t treat everyone equally. That was also a fault of Maria’s.　</p>
<p>However, the boy named Fay reached a major turning point one day. He changed, and things developed in that duel. He was treated like a punching bag, and ended up in a state close to serious.</p>
<p>Luckily, his wounds managed to heal completely using healing potions and medicine. All that was left was for him to wake up. During that time, Maria was thinking: how should she call out to him?　</p>
<p>When Fay woke up, she desperately pulled a smile and spoke to him.　</p>
<p><em>Fay… I wonder if you’re okay.</em>　</p>
<p>“Fay? Are you okay?”　</p>
<p>“Obviously. These are mere scratches.”</p>
<p>“That’s definitely not the case Fay!”</p>
<p><em>He treated those… as scratches? There’s no way that’s the case. But it doesn’t seem as though he is lying either.</em>　</p>
<p>From her perspective, Fay immediately turned into an eerie existence. It made it harder for her to approach him, but she had to because she was a Sister and he was a child of the orphanage she was responsible for.　</p>
<p>“Fay, why did you suddenly begin to take up swordsmanship?”　</p>
<p>She asked him. After a moment of thinking, he answered.　</p>
<p>“To reach greater heights. Also… to destroy Abyss.”　</p>
<p>At that moment, Maria was astonished. It felt like a piece of the puzzle finally fit just right.　</p>
<p>Indeed. The boy was similar to her, his parents were slain by Abyss… and then he arrived here.　</p>
<p><em>Perhaps he began to learn the art of the sword to become a knight…? To avenge his own parents? Yes, he is the same as me… an avenger. He was trying to relieve the regrets of his parents who were slain by the monsters…</em>　</p>
<p><em>So he carried such thoughts all this time. But maybe, Fay was just wondering what he could do to achieve his revenge. He must have been scared. To think he chose such a path… just like me back then.</em>　</p>
<p><em>That’s why he tried to form relationships with others in his own way. He was just clumsy, so he failed at it. Neither the children of the orphanage nor I could understand his attempts… but he was always festering in pain all alone, actually wishing that somebody could stop him.</em>　</p>
<p>Maria concluded that that was the reason for his arrogant attitude.　</p>
<p>It naturally made her remember of her own past, living for revenge. However, as she was active as a knight, she had gained comrades and friends; and also gratitude from the people she saved. Therefore, she managed to choose a path to help others instead of revenge.　</p>
<p>The comrades around her stopped revenge from ruining her.　</p>
<p>“I see… So you’re still… thinking about that time… No, you’ve been alone… yet you still remember. About the moment when your parents were gone.”</p>
<p>“It’s all in the past, I don&#8217;t remember at all. So don’t worry about it.”　</p>
<p><em>He doesn’t remember? There’s no way that’s the case. Did I… just force him to make up a painful lie…?</em>　</p>
<p>She was ashamed that he needed to tell her such a lie. What a thing she has done…　</p>
<p>“…Aah, that’s why there’s no need for unnecessary worry.”　</p>
<p>However, Fay spoke to her as if he thought nothing of it. That was another thing Maria was surprised by.　</p>
<p>“—gh…I see, you’re right. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Why are you apologizing? It’s not something for you to be concerned about.”</p>
<p><em>—Why does he act this way?　</em></p>
<p><em>Because of my slip of tongue, he felt that I was blaming myself for his parents’ deaths. That’s why he told me not to care despite knowing that. He makes up yet another painful lie…</em>　</p>
<p>Before she knew it, the boy appeared to have changed… no, that wasn’t it. She came to understand that the boy resolved to be alone. It was the resolve to walk upon a path of vengeance, the resolve to walk on a path of darkness…　</p>
<p><em>I can understand, for I was once an avenger myself…</em>　</p>
<p><em>He chose not to depend on others, but on himself to open up the way, all while trying to make connections with others clumsily. However, nobody was able to understand him, and since no one tried to befriend him despite how much he tried, he chose to stop doing it altogether.</em>　</p>
<p>“So, are your wounds alright? I’ll scold Tlue later…”　</p>
<p>“No, you don’t have to.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p><div class="watas-9486d0f7cb535ddfafd4c713343f2a84 watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-9486d0f7cb535ddfafd4c713343f2a84"></div>
<p><strong>“Because I’m not angry about it. It allowed me to learn of my strengths and step forward to the future. For me, it was necessary.”　</strong></p>
<p>“—gh. I see, I guess that’s how it is… I’m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>—How far this boy has gone…　</em></p>
<p>By the time it happened for the third time, she was horrified.　</p>
<p><em>To accept the punishment of what he has done so far, he purposefully chose to expose his shameful appearance in front of everyone in the orphanage. It was his way of confessing his faults to others in the orphanage by getting beaten up in a flashy manner and becoming tattered like this.</em>　</p>
<p><em>He chose to receive the punishment, and by doing so has cut himself off from his past…</em>　</p>
<p><em>And to choose vengeance, he has resolved to bet his life on getting stronger… that should be the case.</em>　</p>
<p><em>Even though he is kind to his core… why did I leave him all alone until he ended up like this? Did I ever embrace this child with my all even once…?</em>　</p>
<p>She embraced Fay with all she could. However, Fay didn’t embrace her back.　</p>
<p><em>So, we no longer walk the same path… this is his way of telling me. All while being considerate to me…</em>　</p>
<p>“It’s alright. I will always be with you… Fay… I love you.”　</p>
<p><em>If this child ends up walking that path, I will do my best to stop him. Until he is willing to embrace me back, I will try over and over again no matter how many times it takes…</em>　</p>
<p>Sister Maria resolutely swore that she would no longer leave this clumsy and lonely boy all by himself anymore.</p>
