<h2>Chapter 2 &#8211; Sightseeing in the Holy City!</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After arriving at the capital, we decided to look for a place to stay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we had no specific information on what kind of lodging would be good for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Adventurers&#8217; Guild would be helpful in such a situation. The guild staff would know of a good place to stay, and could ask them for recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We headed straight for the Adventurers&#8217; Guild, asking people on the street for the location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Adventurers&#8217; Guild in the holy city was a bit smaller than the one in the royal capital of Perdis, but it was a magnificent building with white as its base color to match the cityscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay then, shall we.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inside of the building was crowded with people, and the reception counter looked busy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided to have lunch at the cafeteria attached to the building and asked the waiter who brought us water to recommend us a menu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you have any recommendations?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure. I recommend the boiled white fish.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then I&#8217;ll go with that. What about you guys?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked, and they all nodded in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, so, same order for everyone, thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it. Please give me a few!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, right. One more thing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The waiter, who was about to return to the kitchen, turned and looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had forgotten the objective of asking for lodging recommendation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What else can I help you with?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re looking for a place to stay, do you have any good recommendations?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh right, then I recommend ‘Shirakaba’ inn. My childhood friend runs the place. And the food is also delicious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That settles it. Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not at all, I am happy to recommend my friend&#8217;s inn, as well, so I don&#8217;t mind whatsoever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The waiter said and headed to the kitchen to prepare our order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While waiting for our food, we discussed our schedule for the rest of our stay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Does anyone have any suggestions regarding places they’d like to visit?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked, and Ephyr raised her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. I’d like to check out the cathedral!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cathedral huh, I would have gone there even if Ephyr had not suggested it. The purpose of the trip is sightseeing, no way I’m passing up checking out such a massive building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, me too, so I guess we’ll move it up then. Anyone else?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, it’s Asha. It’s unusual for Asha to actively raise her hand at a time like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um, I&#8217;d like to go, or rather, if we&#8217;re going to the cathedral, I&#8217;d like to say a prayer&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Does it not count?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha became depressed and shaken up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Asha like that, I hurriedly corrected her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh no, no, not at all! In fact, I’ll join you in your prayers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-Okay!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha smiled like a blossoming flower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it my imagination that her cheeks were slightly reddish?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Asha like this, Iris, Ephyr, Suzuno and Finne all blurted out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a guy&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asha&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8217;Will there be more&#8230;?&#8217;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto&#8230;the future looks so bleak right now&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can&#8217;t believe the horribly cold gazes they&#8217;re sending my way!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, uh, anyone else?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The food arrived while talking about such things trying to change the subject, and we decided on our future plans while eating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Well, let&#8217;s just go to the inn and sort out our accommodations first .”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we finished eating, we asked the waiter for directions and decided to go to the inn called ‘Shirakaba’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We found the inn without any particular difficulty, and after getting some rooms and leaving the carriage, we decided to head for the cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Zero, being a monster, did not seem to be interested in the cathedral at all and said he wanted to go shopping for books.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then I will accompany Zero. I&#8217;d like to tour the city for a bit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Kusel said she would accompany Zero, I gave them both more money to buy books.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then I&#8217;ll be off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We parted from Zero and Kusel in front of the inn and started walking toward the cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What kind of place is the cathedral?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris answered my question on the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well&#8230;it&#8217;s not so much that there&#8217;s anything special about it, but that the building itself is a tourist attraction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are there a lot of tourists?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, quite a lot of them. Most of the tourists who come to the holy city are interested in the cathedral, which is where we are going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ho~, this should be fun then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While walking to the cathedral, Iris and Asha gave me some more information about the Holy State of Belifaire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The head of the Holy State of Belifaire is called the Pope, and he is currently a man named Liebert Heilig.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is highly respected and treats the poor without discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There seem to be no bad rumors at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the Pope’s daughter is a user of sacred magic and recovery magic, and is called a ‘saint’ by everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her name is Ilmina Heilig.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is 17 years old, just like me. And she’s friends with Iris, as her position is similar to that of a princess in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The position that assists the Pope, the king, is called a cardinal, which is similar to a prime minister or minister in other countries. In this country, religious organizations are closely related to the operation of the country, and this is why they are given such titles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we were talking, we arrived at the foot of the cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking up, I realized that this cathedral is a work of art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the pillars was decorated with detailed carvings, and lots of people having to stop to just get a good look and admire them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We walked inside the cathedral with such people in our sights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inside of the cathedral was as much a work of art as the outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I were to compare with similar structures on earth, I would hardpressed to find a handful. At the very least, I have never seen such a magnificent and artistic structure in my life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked around the cathedral again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunlight shines through the brightly colored stained glass and glass windows, illuminating the interior of the cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paintings on the walls and ceilings were so fascinating that they seemed ready to move, and the statues so detailed that they appeared to be alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess this is exactly what it means to be moved to the core.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne and the others were so stunned and were like, “It&#8217;s so beautiful”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to keep looking at it, but standing near the entrance would have gotten in the way of other people, so we decided to walk around the cathedral for a bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered how long it had been since we started looking at the paintings and sculptures in the cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The light coming in was orange-tinged, and I realized that the sun was beginning to set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, how fast time flies. Shall we pray one last time and then go back to the inn. Zero and Kusel are probably waiting for us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my suggestion, Finne, Iris, Asha, Ephyr and Suzuno nodded their heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we went to an area called the chapel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we entered, the sunset light illuminated the statues of the goddesses, making them glow with a divine radiance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a girl kneeling in front of the statues, her hands folded in front of her chest in fervent prayer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was dressed in a sisters&#8217; uniform and had straight blond hair. The setting sun reflected off her hair, making it shine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris looked at the girl and murmured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Ilmina?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait a minute, Ilmina, the saint?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The murmur seemed to have reached the young girl’s ears, and she stopped praying and looked back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her amber eyes caught Iris&#8217;s and&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That voice&#8230; Iris?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——I knew it had to be Ilmina!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, convinced that it was Ilmina, ran up to the girl and hugged her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow, Is that really you, Iris?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris still hugging the girl, but then she pulled away and faced Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon seeing Iris again, Ilmina was wearing a surprised expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, she would be surprised to see Iris, the princess of a country, appear without any prior information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been two years since I last saw you and now you’re all grown up. Are you not together with His Majesty Dillan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m traveling together with these people at the moment! And of course, I have Asha with me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris answered with pride as Ilmina looked at us and muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Ilmina looked at her, Asha bowed, “It&#8217;s been a while, Lady Ilmina”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina bowed her head in return and then turned her gaze back to Iris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m glad to see that you’re doing all right, Asha. So, who are these fine people?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right♪”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris bragged with her nose up as if to pierce the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We stepped forward and introduced ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello. My name is Haruto, an adventurer. Pleasure to meet you, saint. And beside me are——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne and the others introduced themselves after being prompted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finne. I am also an adventurer like Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m Ephyr, an elf.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My name is Suzuno. Pleasure&#8230;is this good enough?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina also introduced herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nice to meet you all. My name is Ilmina Heilig. Although I’m called a ‘saint’, you don’t need to be formal with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was impressed by the graceful manner in which Ilmina bowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Iris looked at me with a surprised expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ha-Haruto, why are you being weird?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iris~&#8230;what do you mean weird, this is how I usually am when I meet someone for the first time, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s fine, Ilmina doesn’t care about that sort of thing!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Iris like that, Ilmina nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iris is right, everyone, please make yourselves comfortable and act as you normally do. I really don&#8217;t mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her smiling face was truly saintly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay. Don’t mind if I do then, Lady Ilmina.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please call me Ilmina, since you’re a friend of Iris.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris then repudiated her conception which led her to believe that we were friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto is not my friend, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina seemed lost by Iris’ denial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can’t blame her. If we weren&#8217;t friends, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to talk to the princess so casually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your bodyguard&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not quite, Haruto is my husband!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; &#8230;Come again?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cautioned Iris as I looked at Ilmina, who had stiffened up upon hearing the word ‘husband’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, that&#8217;s still a long way off&#8230;I mean, are you sure you want to make this public?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It doesn’t matter. It&#8217;s already been decided that Finne will be the first wife and the secondary wives will be me, Suzuno, and Ephyr.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Iris’ face giving the “of course not” vibe, I too was like “o-oh&#8230;right”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then Ilmina finally seemed to grasp the meaning behind Iris&#8217; words, her face turned red and she opened her mouth with a gasp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fo-Four brides&#8230;h-how immoral&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The saint seems to have a weakness for this kind of story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While covering her face with both hands, Ilmina glanced at me through the gaps between her fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cleared my throat and decided to change the subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Definitely not because I feel embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More importantly, we are here on sightseeing and thought we could also pray while at it&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?! Oh, right! Sure, you’re welcome to pray!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a flushed face, Ilmina showed us around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m starting to feel a little sorry for her&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I asked her about something that had occurred to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the way, I&#8217;m thinking of making a donation&#8230;is there a fixed amount or something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh thank you very much. There is no such thing, it depends entirely on the individual.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m grateful to god, so I&#8217;d like to give a reasonable amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the god I met was an old man, the statue is of a goddess. Well, I certainly don&#8217;t mind, because I’d rather give money to a beautiful goddess than to that old man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I took out an appropriate amount of money from the dimensional storage and handed it to Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, perhaps it was more money than she had expected, Ilmina’s eyes lit up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? T-This much? Are you a noble, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, like I said before, I&#8217;m an adventurer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wha? &#8230;Are you perhaps a high ranking adventurer?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m no noble, but an adventurer with money, or so Ilmina thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto is an EX rank adventurer!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris answered proudly, as if boasting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, why are you the one answering&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, Ilmina stiffened again, and after a few beats, she let out a loud yell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Say, whaaaaaaaaaaat?! Oh, that person who is said to be the strongest adventurer is actually you, Haruto?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? Is that what they say in this country too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. I heard that you single-handedly annihilated a horde of ten thousand vicious monsters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, they are not wrong&#8230;it’s also thanks to everyone who held out on the front lines, so it kind of gives me mixed feelings when they say it like that as if the credit belongs to me alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing my expression, Ilmina smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Still, it is true that you defeated vicious and powerful monsters and saved a lot of people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded honestly, since it was not something to deny so stubbornly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyway, that&#8217;s why I have money, so take it. I&#8217;m grateful to god, too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right. Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I handed the money I had taken out to Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay then, everyone, please come this way. The manners are not strict, so please just do as I do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ilmina walked up to the statue, she got down on her knees, and folded her hands in front of her chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We followed Ilmina and performed the same prayer behind her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gave my thanks to the old man——god.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to you, I&#8217;m alive and had the opportunity to meet everyone. I was able to protect the people I wanted to protect, the people I cared about. For that I’m grateful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that everyone finished praying at about the same time as I did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris turned to Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks for today! I’ll be staying here for a little while, so I&#8217;ll come by again♪.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please do, Iris. I&#8217;ll speak to my father——the Pope, too, everyone, so feel free to come by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We nodded in agreement and decided to return to the inn for the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇ ◇ ◇ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same night she met Iris and the others, Ilmina Heilig had a meeting with her father, Pope Liebert Heilig.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My God, Princess Iris is here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. Although with her fiancee&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the mention of Ilmina’s words, Liebert, who was dressed in white formal wear, opened his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had not received any information that Iris, the princess of a neighboring country, had a fiancee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who’s the fiancee? Was it a noble from the Kingdom of Perdis? Or perhaps someone from the empire?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Liebert&#8217;s words, Ilmina shook her head in denial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not exactly&#8230;does dear father know adventurer Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert nodded “Yea” at the name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew of him because he had attended the meeting of kings of various countries held when Haruto was promoted to EX rank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert recalled the footage shown to him at the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His jet-black appearance, laying waste to tens of thousands of enemies, was worthy of being called the ‘Demon King’, as his name implies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I thought it dangerous to give him the unprecedented EX rank because of his mighty power, Dillan Arclaidh Perdis, King of the Kingdom of Perdis, approved his promotion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Wait, is that person Princess Iris’&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina nodded silently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert, upon receiving this information, considered the possibility that the King of Perdis might have adopted Haruto as a military force for his country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that he could annihilate an entire army by himself in a time of war would have a great impact if he were to join forces with a single country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Have you met Master Haruto, Ilmina?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, briefly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, can I ask you your opinion, Ilmina? Now that you’ve spoken with him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well&#8230;from what I saw he didn’t look anything special, but I could tell he holds enormous power within him. Iris has a good eye for people. The fact that Iris likes him means that she can trust him with her whole heart. He doesn’t seem like a bad person to me&#8230;but rather, someone desperately trying to live.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone interfered with his beliefs, he would not hesitate to kill them. Ilmina intuitively sensed that kind of desperation to live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert nodded at his daughter&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina is a good judge of character, and if she says so, it must be true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you think that if war breaks out between the Kingdom of Perdis and other countries, Master Haruto will participate?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know. But if someone he cares about is involved, he would probably join in. I don&#8217;t know which side he would be on, but I think he might take on all the countries they’re at war with&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, Liebert could only hope that there would be no war in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he changed the subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, was it just the two of them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No. Asha, Iris&#8217;s attendant was also there. Along with his fiancee, an adventurer named Finne, and his other fiancees, Ephyr and Suzuno.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Ilmina mentioned the names of everyone present, Liebert nodded his head curiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would like to meet and have a chat with them if possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll tell them that the next time I see them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good. Let them know they’re free to come by anytime.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then came a knock on the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Holiness, it’s Alben Mardas. I’m here to make a report.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Excuse me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man in his early forties entered the room. He was Cardinal Alben Mardas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, you are here too, Lady Ilmina.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. We’re just having a little chat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. In that case, sorry for the interruption.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, not at all. You’re here to make a report, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s this about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert asked, and Alben opened his mouth with a serious look on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right. We have been experiencing a number of disappearances recently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At these words, Ilmina and Liebert&#8217;s faces grew tense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a problem that had been plaguing them for some time now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please continue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert urged Alben to continue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure. According to the information we have received, there is a group of people who are collecting sacrifices to perform a demon-summoning ritual.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Say what? A demon!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina was so surprised that she screamed out loud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wasn’t the only one. Liebert was equally surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ——Demons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spiritual life form that exists in hell. Demons have overwhelming power, but cannot exist in this world because they do not have a physical body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, they can be summoned——made manifest in this world by offering a sacrificial body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also said that by offering a different price than the price of the summoning, the demon can grant wishes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different ranks of demons, the highest being the kings and the dukes. Next are the high-ranking demons: counts, viscounts, and barons. Below these are the lower demons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even a high-ranking demon is as powerful as an army, but the power of the highest-ranking demon is so great that if a duke-class demon were to appear, it is said that they could level a country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And they are trying to summon such a vicious and powerful demon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert asked Alben calmly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cardinal Alben. Do we know anything else about this group?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I&#8217;m afraid not&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben shook his head apologetically, but continued with “but”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have a feeling they’re not far from performing the summoning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, we must deal with this as soon as possible——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina said in a panicked tone, but Liebert tolerated it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ilmina. calm down. We&#8217;re going to figure it out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ye, yes&#8230;I’m sorry, I lost my composure for a bit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert knew that she was speaking out of concern for the people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cardinal Alben. I want the captain of the Order of the Holy Knights here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood. Please wait a moment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben left the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina asked Liebert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you asking for the captain of the Order of the Holy Knights?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to discuss how to deal with the situation. I am sure he will come up with some kind of plan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, there was a knock on the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s Alben. I have brought Captain Gawain Hazark of the Holy Knights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please come in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben opened the door and walked in. A figure of at least 180 centimeters tall, dressed in white and silver armor, stood behind him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had short platinum blond hair and eyes as blue as the sky. He’s a beautiful young man in his early twenties with well-proportioned eyes and nose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is Gawain Hazark, Captain of the Holy Knights of the Holy Land of Belifaire. The strongest Holy Knight of the Holy State of Belifaire, and his name is widely known throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Gawain came close to Liebert, he kneeled down and bowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I, Gawain Hazark, have come before your summons.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m glad you came.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes sir. So, Your Holiness, what&#8217;s the matter?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain looked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert told Gawain what Alben had told him earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——So, that’s what we’re discussing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain nodded as he listened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. Then, shall we mobilize the Knights and search everywhere?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert shook his head and opened his mouth</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, that would cause unrest among the people. I would like for us to handle this as quietly as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina then asserted as she followed up Liebert&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that possible&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, I mean, we’ll have to come up with some kind of measures of course——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, after a long deliberation, they decided on&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, the Knights are to blend in with the general public and gather information about this organization. I ask that all information be passed on to me. Cardinal Alben, too, please continue to gather more information.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain and Alben nodded at Liebert&#8217;s statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Ilmina had a bad feeling about this matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But all she could do was heal people with holy magic and pray. She had no choice but to leave everything else to others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went to the chapel of the cathedral, got down on both knees in front of the statue of the goddess, and prayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">——May nothing bad come out of this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a certain basement in the capital of the Holy State of Belifaire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around a round table set up in the center of the room, five people wearing black hoods were seated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the center of the round table, a candle was lit, illuminating the dark room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst the silence, one of them opened his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How are the preparations coming?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a very low, middle-aged man&#8217;s voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everything is going accordingly. Preparations for the demon summoning are almost in their final phases. All that’s left is the sacrifice required for the ritual.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The sacrifice, huh&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of people to be sacrificed for summoning a demon can be any number of people. But the better the quality, the higher the rank of the demon to be summoned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best sacrifices were those who were compatible with demons, those who possessed hatred or strong malice, and conversely, those who had pure and noble souls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can’t afford any mishap with the preparations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And the sacrifice&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, let&#8217;s use the saint. Then we can summon the highest-ranking demon. Killing her might cause problems, so we will use only her blood, and we can prepare other sacrifices.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;In that case, I will secure the saint myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you up to it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The saint has a lot of personal security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be close to impossible to snatch her from under their noses, yet the man nodded confidently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The saint is always in the cathedral. I can easily abduct her from there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then the man shared his plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——that’s the plan, so, what do y’all think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. Let&#8217;s go with that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing the explanation, the four men nodded their heads. They thought it had a decent chance of success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And if you fail?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will be executed for sure. But rest assured anything related to the organization will die with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Needless to say.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, we&#8217;ll carry out the plan on the next full moon. Any questions?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Totally Silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man took the silence as an affirmation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dismissed. Glory be upon us!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““““——Glory be upon us!””””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then they all smiled wickedly, as if possessed by something.</span></p>
