<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 11: The Seventh of July</h2>



<p>The seventh of July.&nbsp; The weather forecast: clear skies.</p>



<p>As this day was a holiday, Fumiya and You cut smallish sprays of bamboo and brought them to decorate the garden just outside the house.</p>



<p>House Minazuki seemingly put up decorations for the Tanabata Festival every year, but I thought it was somehow kind of amusing to watch high school boys arranging Tanabata decorations so faithfully.</p>



<p>“Would the two of you like to take a little break?&nbsp; There’s cold barley tea.”</p>



<p>It was precisely time for our three o’ clock tea.</p>



<p>“Yay!&nbsp; I’m so hot I could die.&nbsp; I’m so thirsty I could die.”</p>



<p>Next to the veranda, You took off his wooden clogs and tossed them aside, and tumbled into the Japanese-style sitting room.&nbsp; Behind him, Fumiya picked up those clogs and lined them up on a stepping stone, and then he, too, came inside from the veranda.</p>



<p>Umi came as well, and all of us had teatime together.</p>



<p>Since the main family received gifts frequently, we never ran low on teatime snacks.&nbsp; Even now, I’d set out manju pastries and an assortment of rice crackers, chocolates, and more.&nbsp; Each of us took the ones we liked.</p>



<p>“Come to think of it, you said that the Tanabata legend has a connection to House Minazuki too, didn’t you?”&nbsp; All of a sudden, I remembered that and asked casually, “Chidori of Fushimi is called ‘Ori-hime’ like in the story, but&#8230;<em>is</em> it because of Tanabata?”</p>



<p>You looked over in Fumiya’s direction.&nbsp; “What was that?”</p>



<p>“That’s correct&#8230;because Ori-hime is also a ‘celestial maiden,’ so to speak.&nbsp; We of House Minazuki consider the Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, the Tanabata legend, stories that feature a celestial maiden, to have common ground with the robe of feathers legends, in that they are traditions concealing something about the Lunar World.&nbsp; For that reason, in House Minazuki, we have an ancient custom of crowning special women with the name of a princess who is close to a celestial maiden.&nbsp; From here on out, I believe that you, too, will hear yourself addressed as ‘Kaguya-hime’ time and time again by the members of House Minazuki.”</p>



<p>“Ah, ahaha.”</p>



<p>I kind of wanted to beg pardon for that, but if it were a House Minazuki custom, then it was probably unavoidable.</p>



<p>Crunching on her beloved Gari-Gari Kun soda-flavored popsicle, Umi stated with a disgusted look, “Hmm, there are others too.&nbsp; Benten, goddess of music, wealth, and wisdom; Oto-hime, princess of the undersea palace; Kikuishi-hime, from the tale of the princess and the dragon-eye stone; Toyouke-hime, goddess of agriculture and industry&#8230;.&nbsp; If we didn’t worship the celestial maiden so much, then we probably wouldn’t go so far – it’s very like House Minazuki.”</p>



<p>Although I was unfamiliar with some of those names, which celestial maiden was ultimately the one who’d founded House Minazuki?&nbsp; The main family’s Kaguya-hime?&nbsp; Or&#8230;maybe not?</p>



<p>“Umi, do you also have a special form of address?”</p>



<p>“Ugh.&nbsp; I don’t have one, so I don’t have two names like that.”</p>



<p>This reaction – it meant that she actually wished for two names, didn’t it&#8230;?</p>



<p>Off to the side, Fumiya was making rustling noises, checking on the bamboo boxes in the sitting room.</p>



<p>As I wondered what he was doing, he took out long, narrow strips of colored paper and set them on the low table.</p>



<p>“Whaa, every year we go through <em>this</em> tradition.”</p>



<p>You’s gaze was distant.&nbsp; Surely, <em>this</em> was&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Yes, these are strips of paper for composing poetry.&nbsp; Please write your wishes on <em>these</em> as you like.”&nbsp; To the end, Fumiya spoke in dead earnest, clutching four strips of paper and brush pens in his hand.</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I was surprised that anyone past elementary school would write wishes on strips of paper.</p>



<p>However, since they put up Tanabata decorations, of course they did.</p>



<p>“Ugh.&nbsp; The four of us will write down our wishes by ourselves, and all we can do is put up plain Tanabata decorations.&nbsp; We’ll write that we want this, and we want that, and there’s not even anyone to buy them for us.&nbsp; I look forward to Christmas a bit more.”</p>



<p>Even as she said that and more, Umi used several paper strips and wrote this and that.</p>



<p>It looked like all of them were a list of games she wanted.</p>



<p>To the side, You was curious about Fumiya’s wish.</p>



<p>“What are you writing, Big Bro?&nbsp; To pass your entrance exams?”</p>



<p>“I’m not worried about the entrance exams.”</p>



<p>“Whoa, so chill –-&nbsp; When you’re aiming for Kyoto University, no less.”</p>



<p>&#8230;What?&nbsp; Fumiya was aiming for the extremely selective Kyoto University??</p>



<p>He managed the family business, and he didn’t attend cram school, and he hung around here with such a relaxed air.&nbsp; It was just like him.</p>



<p>Or rather, when did he study?</p>



<p>“What are <em>you</em> writing, You?” Fumiya asked.</p>



<p>“I’ve decided.&nbsp; I’d like a tad more inspiration for my designs.&nbsp; And a long, healthy life!”</p>



<p>After a space of time, Fumiya replied, “Is that so?”</p>



<p>Why did Umi, too, wear a grave expression on this occasion alone?</p>



<p>“Well, how about you, Rikka?”</p>



<p>“Uh, m–me?!”</p>



<p>No, I’d been expecting them to ask me, but still&#8230;.</p>



<p>I looked hesitantly at my own strip of paper.</p>



<p>“I–I&#8230;wrote, for today to be an enjoyable day.&nbsp; Because it’s Fumiya’s birthday.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Huh, what was with this silence?</p>



<p>“Hey, be a lot greedier, Rikka,” said Umi.&nbsp; “I think that if you write down what you want, Fumi will buy them for you on some pretext or other?&nbsp; I’m hoping for that?”</p>



<p>“Stop being so open about desires that rely on other people, Umi,” Fumiya told her.</p>



<p>Even when he pointed that out, Umi showed no concern whatsoever and went out of the veranda to hang up her own strips of paper.&nbsp; After that, Fumiya and You, and then I, too, filed outside.</p>



<p>Even when all four of us hung up the paper strips on which we’d written our wishes, our Tanabata decorations still looked shabby, so we hung up the leftover strips of colored paper here and there too.</p>



<p>“Ohh!”</p>



<p>As I decorated, I remembered a certain matter, and I gave a loud cry.</p>



<p>Because of that, I gave everyone a considerable shock.</p>



<p>“Cake!&nbsp; I have to prepare cake!&nbsp; What do I do, I completely forgot about it.&nbsp; There must be a Western dessert shop around here, right?”</p>



<p>When I went pale and trembled, You said, “Yup.”</p>



<p>Fumiya said, “It’s all right, Rikka.&nbsp; If it’s about the matter of a birthday cake, our Fushimi grandmother will prepare one for us.&nbsp; She always does, on our birthdays.”</p>



<p>“Fushimi’s&#8230;Chidori does?”</p>



<p>“Because our great-grandfather hated Western desserts and never prepared cake on our birthdays.&nbsp; So our Fushimi grandmother would send us cake in secret.”&nbsp; Hanging up decorations, Umi explained this to me, looking as if she already couldn’t wait for the cake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fumiya added to her story.&nbsp; “My predecessor, Izayoi, had just a bit of a weakness when it came to our Fushimi grandmother.&nbsp; Just for the cake that she prepared, he would let us siblings eat it.”</p>



<p>Somehow, that was a really heartwarming episode.&nbsp; Chidori looked strict, but she was a grandmother who loved her grandchildren, after all.</p>



<p>Right at that moment, the front door intercom rang.</p>



<p>“It’s gotta be the cake!”</p>



<p>“Hmm, it’s a little early, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“Apart from the cake, what would we get!”</p>



<p>In the middle of Umi and You bickering like that, before I could go, Fumiya headed straight from the garden to the front entrance for guests.&nbsp; I chased after him.</p>



<p>“Hey, Minazuki.&nbsp; Happy birthday.&nbsp; And Rikka, thanks for the other day!”</p>



<p>“Karen?!” I cried.</p>



<p>“Ashiya too,” said Fumiya.&nbsp; “It’s rare to see the two of you together.”</p>



<p>For some reason, it was Student Council President Karen Tsuchimikado and the Student Council member boy called Ashiya who’d come to our home.&nbsp; He was the one with the spiky hair and the slightly sharp gaze.</p>



<p>Karen signaled with her eyes to Ashiya, who was standing behind her and holding a big box.</p>



<p>Ashiya said, “Here you are,” took a big step forward, and held it out to Fumiya.</p>



<p>Fumiya and I looked at each other.</p>



<p>“It’s a special, big, free gift from House Tsuchimikado that serves as both a thank-you to Rikka, and a birthday present to Minazuki.&nbsp; Gather the family tonight and have a live-Japanese-tiger-prawn-eating party!”</p>



<p>“Ja–Japanese tiger prawns?!”</p>



<p>I jumped.&nbsp; I’d never eaten that kind of luxury food live this way before.</p>



<p>As Fumiya accepted the box, he bowed his head somewhat apologetically.</p>



<p>“President, and Ashiya too, thank you very much for what you do, year after year.&nbsp; Even after I told you that Minazuki troubles were what caused that kakure paper image incident in the first place.”</p>



<p>“Ahaha,&#8221; Karen laughed.&nbsp; “Didn’t you apologize enough for that incident in the Student Council Room already?&nbsp; You prostrated yourself.”</p>



<p>“He prostrated himself?!”</p>



<p>I was getting shocked over and over.&nbsp; Although I’d been curious how he’d explained that incident to everyone on the Student Council, Fumiya had apologized to the point of prostrating himself?</p>



<p>“His prostration was too beautiful, so all the Student Council members felt moved, or burst out laughing, or recoiled from him!&nbsp; Hey, Ashiya.”</p>



<p>“Well, yep.&nbsp; I laughed a little.”</p>



<p>“I was impressed!&nbsp; That was just what I expected from the Head of House Minazuki, with its long, distinguished history – even his prostration pose was perfect, I said.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Besides, Minazuki.&nbsp; That kind of trouble is both of our trouble.&nbsp; My House and House Minazuki are allies, aren’t we!&nbsp; Hahaha.”</p>



<p>Karen thumped Fumiya on the shoulder and laughed merrily.</p>



<p>“Um.&nbsp; Would the two of you like to come up?” I invited them.&nbsp; “I’ll serve tea.”</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, we have some odds and ends to deal with, mediating a turf war between raccoon dogs and foxes!&nbsp; Let me make you wait until next time, Rikka.”</p>



<p>Karen and Ashiya seemed busy.&nbsp; What in the world was a turf war between raccoon dogs and foxes&#8230;?</p>



<p>After we’d accompanied them to the residence’s gate, as we watched their backs descending the stone steps, Fumiya asked me this kind of question:&nbsp; “Rikka, how do you see their relationship?”</p>



<p>“Huh?&nbsp; How, you said&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I considered it for a moment.</p>



<p>Student Council mentor and mentee.&nbsp; An attendant – no, a bodyguard?&nbsp; No, could he be – a gofer&#8230;??</p>



<p>“Actually, those two are a betrothed couple.”</p>



<p>“What?!&nbsp; No way, they are?!”</p>



<p>He really shocked me.&nbsp; Or rather, I’d been imagining some really rude things.</p>



<p>“Ashiya is the third son of the distinguished House Ashiya.&nbsp; Even if he looks like that, that guy has considerable talent, and a little earlier, it was decided that he would marry into House Tsuchimikado.&nbsp; Even though right now they still feel like mentor and mentee, don’t they?”</p>



<p>Fumiya’s gaze turned slowly in my direction.</p>



<p>“There is no mistaking that those two will become the leaders of Kyoto’s next generation of exorcists.&nbsp; We most likely have a very long association ahead of us.&nbsp; I don’t know what to say, except to please take care of those two as well, Rikka.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yes.&nbsp; Of course I will.”</p>



<p>I nodded.</p>



<p>Then it hit me just how strange of a world I’d stepped into.</p>



<p>Betrothals, which ran counter to the times, existed naturally.</p>



<p>Even though this was definitely modern Japan, and we were definitely high school students.</p>



<p>However, if they didn’t do it that way, their world wouldn’t persist, and if they didn’t exist, there was an order that wouldn’t exist.&nbsp; Those people had accepted that, and so by no means could you call them unfortunate.</p>



<p>Although the relationship between those two felt different from Fumiya’s and mine, they certainly seemed to trust each other, I thought as I watched their backs disappear, side by side.</p>

<p>All right.&nbsp; We returned to the residence and happily carried the box of live Japanese tiger prawns into the sitting room.</p>



<p>Pretty much everyone wanted to see for themselves.</p>



<p>“Ohh, amazing.&nbsp; They’re really Japanese tiger prawns!”</p>



<p>“These are alive?”</p>



<p>You’s eyes were gleaming.&nbsp; Squatting down, Umi poked at the prawns.&nbsp; Inside the box, surrounded by sawdust, they were behaving themselves.&nbsp; Because they were still alive, one leaped up, startling everyone.</p>



<p>“Isn’t that great, Big Bro?&nbsp; You love shrimp tempura, so Rikka can make it for you.”&nbsp; And, smiling, You clapped a hand on Fumiya’s shoulder.</p>



<p>After a moment of silence, Fumiya stood up abruptly.</p>



<p>“Um.&nbsp; &#8230;Fumiya, do you like shrimp tempura?” I asked.</p>



<p>After coming here, I’d finally identified Fumiya’s favorite food.</p>



<span id="more-225"></span>



<p>At that, for some reason, he hid his face in embarrassment.&nbsp; “&#8230;I beg your pardon, I like them.”</p>



<p>“Muahaha, isn’t it great?&nbsp; Isn’t it kinda cute coming from a high school boy!”</p>



<p>You and Umi exploded with laughter&#8230;.</p>



<p>No, for sure, I also thought it was unexpected for shrimp tempura, a Western-inspired dish, to be the favorite food of the Head of an ancient family.&nbsp; To be honest, I also thought it was cute.&nbsp; Yep.</p>



<p>“Then let’s have Japanese tiger prawn tempura today!&nbsp; Thank goodness, I learned Fumiya’s favorite food on his birthday.”</p>



<p>“Uh – I want to eat them raw,” said Umi.</p>



<p>“We have tons, so let’s have them both ways: sashimi and tempura.”</p>



<p>The front door intercom rang yet again.</p>



<p>Saying, “This time it must be the cake!” Umi flew for the front door.</p>



<p>However, a shriek of “Aaah!” came from that direction, so Fumiya and You and I exchanged glances and hurried towards the front door.</p>



<p>When we arrived, it was only a home delivery, but –</p>



<p>“Oy, Fumi!&nbsp; It’s from Nobunaga of Nagahama!”</p>



<p>As if she’d touched something dirty, Umi was scrubbing her hands on her kimono.&nbsp; Did she really hate him that much?&nbsp; Her betrothed, Nobunaga.</p>



<p>You, too, had this to say: “Seriously?&nbsp; If you open a present from Nobunaga, you’ll get cursed.”</p>



<p>“Mm – &#8230;.”&nbsp; Humming in a low voice, Fumiya opened the cardboard box.</p>



<p>When he did so, long, thin bread rolls wrapped in yellow packaging appeared.&nbsp; On top of that, they were all the same kind.</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s salad rolls!”&nbsp; Umi’s expression changed in a flash.</p>



<p>You said, “That guy knew somehow, didn’t he?” and took out one of them.</p>



<p>“Um, what in the world are these?” I asked.</p>



<p>I was the only one who had no idea what was going on.</p>



<p>“These are the famous ‘salad rolls’ from a bakery called Tsuruya Pan in Nagahama in Shiga Prefecture.&nbsp; Somehow or other, this appears to be a birthday present to me from Nobunaga, and he included a letter too.&nbsp; ‘This is your birthday present.&nbsp; Eat this too!’ it says.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Still, he’d been conscientious enough to send a birthday present&#8230;.</p>



<p>I’d already watched them face off with an odd atmosphere when they met in the past, and they’d looked only like they were on bad terms, but maybe, because they were relatives around the same age, they did get along after all?</p>



<p>“First things first, let me thank him.”</p>



<p>Fumiya took out his phone and swiftly texted Nobunaga.</p>



<p><em>Thank you for the salad rolls.&nbsp; The entire family is delighted.</em></p>



<p>At that, it was immediately marked “read,” and a reply came.</p>



<p><em>Go jump in Lake Biwa.</em></p>



<p>Ah, it <em>was</em> Nobunaga, after all.&nbsp; It was the Nobunaga who detested Fumiya.</p>



<p>And these so-called salad rolls were a giant hit with Umi and You, but what kind of bread were they anyway?</p>



<p>“They mix together mayonnaise and minced daikon radish pickles to form a paste, and they spread it on a fluffy roll.&nbsp; This is delicious,” said Umi.</p>



<p>She’d already polished off one of them.</p>



<p>The combination of mayonnaise and minced daikon radish pickles was exquisite and seemed to be addictive.</p>



<p>“They’ve called it the soul food of Shiga Prefecture on TV before.&nbsp; That Nobunaga, even though he acts that way, he really loves his hometown – “ said You.</p>



<p>He seemed to plan to eat them for a snack during tomorrow’s club activities too.&nbsp; Since there were a lot of them, he said that he’d give them out to everyone in his club as well.</p>



<p>“The expiration date is tomorrow?&nbsp; Well, since everyone at home eats a lot, we’ll probably make it,” I said.</p>



<p>“They’ll be perfect for breakfast too, won’t they?”&nbsp; said Fumiya.</p>



<p>The two of us smiled at each other pleasantly.</p>



<p>I didn’t know if Nobunaga himself had intended this or not, but we were very happy with his present.</p>



<p>“Making a fuss over something at the front door is disgraceful.”</p>



<p>“Oh, Grandmother.”</p>



<p>At some point, Chidori had appeared, standing by the front door.&nbsp; Although she wore a quiet beige kimono today, the water caltrops embroidered on her obi were trendy, and she was wearing her sunglasses.</p>



<p>“It is not ‘Oh, Grandmother,’ my lord!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I understand, Chidori.&nbsp; We received a present from Nobunaga of Nagahama just now.&nbsp; That’s the only reason we’re gathered at the front door.”</p>



<p>At Fumiya’s explanation, Chidori removed her sunglasses and looked down suspiciously at the cardboard box by the front door.&nbsp; It was now a hard stare.</p>



<p>“From Nobunaga of Nagahama?&nbsp; He’s poisoned them, hasn’t he?”</p>



<p>Oh, Chidori was wary of Nobunaga too.</p>



<p>After saying, “Well, it’s probably all right,” she gave a cough.&nbsp; Her sharp eyes caught sight of Umi and You, who were trying to slip away, and she called to them.</p>



<p>“Umi!&nbsp; Looking like that again!&nbsp; Even your hair is disheveled, isn’t it?&nbsp; Please behave a little more modestly and pay attention to your appearance.”</p>



<p>“Oh – “</p>



<p>Looking at nothing in particular, Umi gave a response that said nothing at all.</p>



<p>“You, you’re Fumiya’s younger brother, so you can assist him with family business once in a while.&nbsp; Once in a while!&nbsp; Such as by wearing our kimono too!”</p>



<p>“Ahaha, yeees, Grandmother.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clasping his hands behind his head, You answered flawlessly.</p>



<p>“And Fumiya.”</p>



<p>Chidori faced Fumiya once more, and she held out the box that she was carrying to him.</p>



<p>“Once again, I have brought your birthday cake this year.&nbsp; I wish you a truly happy eighteenth birthday.”</p>



<p>“Ahh.&nbsp; Thank you for doing this every year&#8230;.”</p>



<p>When Fumiya tried to accept the cake, Chidori didn’t let go of the box.&nbsp; She said in a threatening tone, “My lord, you are now eighteen years old!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Don’t emphasize it so desperately, that I’m eighteen.”</p>



<p>“Of course I must.&nbsp; You are an adult, you have reached the age when you can marry.&nbsp; You must focus your energies as the Head of the family, and as the central pillar of the home, even more than you have until now, and safeguard your siblings and your betrothed, Lady Rikka.”</p>



<p>Fumiya replied, “I understand,” and his gaze slid to the side self-consciously.</p>



<p>“And Lady Rikka.”</p>



<p>“‘Ye–yes ma’am!”</p>



<p>Although I wondered if she were going to point out some kind of shortcoming in me too, a gentle smile rose to Chidori’s lips, and she addressed me gracefully.</p>



<p>“From this point hence, and far into the future, please take care of Lord Fumiya.&nbsp; Today, please congratulate him heartily.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yes ma’am!”</p>



<p>I bowed my head too.&nbsp; I would certainly obey her on that point.</p>



<p>Although Chidori tried to leave then, I called to her, “Won’t you stay for tea?” but she shook her head.</p>



<p>“Thank you very much, Lady Rikka.&nbsp; However, if I stay here, I’ll harp on this and that, and the birthday wouldn’t be just a family affair.”</p>



<p>&#8230;Wait, hadn’t she already harped on them?</p>



<p>Unconcerned by everyone’s gazes that said the same thing, Chidori took several salad rolls from the cardboard box.&nbsp; Saying, “See you later,” she went off with a smart step.</p>



<p>Next to the door, Koutaro, who’d removed his suit jacket, was smoking a cigarette.&nbsp; When he noticed our gazes, he flapped one hand in a wave.</p>



<p>Still, the salad rolls were really popular, weren’t they&#8230;.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>All right.&nbsp; Today was the Tanabata Festival and Fumiya’s birthday at the same time, so we received all sorts of gifts.</p>



<p>Besides the delicious-looking strawberry cake that Chidori had brought us earlier, “For the rest, we’ll have Japanese tiger prawn tempura, and Japanese tiger prawn sashimi,” I said to myself.</p>



<p>Incidentally, it seemed like cooking the live Japanese tiger prawns that Karen had given us from a state of suspended animation in ice water would be a good idea, but at the moment, Fumiya and You and Umi were fighting with them in the sitting room.</p>



<p>At any rate, the prawns were very lively, unruly, leaping and scattering sawdust all over the room, so even if we could put them into ice water one by one, we’d have a tough time.</p>



<p>Apart from Fumiya, You and Umi seemed to be bad at dealing with them.</p>



<p>The tsukimari kappa, who’d heard the ruckus and come to see too, were terrified of the dramatically leaping prawns, and they froze up and trembled in one corner of the room.</p>



<p>Even they were low level, they <em>were</em> still yokai&#8230;.</p>



<p>As for me, I’d certainly prepared raw fish and shrimp from time to time, and I’d grabbed them with my bare hands without being that scared.&nbsp; However, Fumiya had said, “Please leave this to us,” so I’d set about making dinner preparations in the kitchen first.</p>



<p>From the sitting room, I could hear “Aargh” and “Whoa”&#8230;.</p>



<p>Their mysterious pride held that using telekinesis would be admitting defeat, and the three siblings’ battle went on even now.</p>



<p>“Yep, apart from shrimp dishes, I wonder if I can’t make some kind of celebratory dish.”</p>



<p>If there were also a Tanabata dish, I thought&#8230;.</p>



<p>When it came to a Tanabata dish, it was somen noodles, and when it came to somen noodles, everyone in the main family more or less thought, “It’s okay in small amounts.”&nbsp; It was a dish they’d eaten too much of.</p>



<p>Thus, I got the impression that somen was a flavor that everyone already kind of wanted to forget, until it got hot and they had to eat it.</p>



<p>But then, what should I do?</p>



<p>Searching for a large platter, I investigated the cupboards.&nbsp; For some reason, that was when the uppermost cupboard, which I hadn’t opened before now, caught my eye, and I climbed onto a stool to open it.</p>



<p>“It’s empty&#8230;?”</p>



<p>No, there was something thin at the very back.</p>



<p>When I stretched out my hand and took it out, it looked like an old recipe notebook.</p>



<p>Could it these be recipes for dishes that had been passed down in House Minazuki for generations&#8230;?</p>



<p>I flipping through the pages experimentally.&nbsp; A handwritten recipe notebook, divided by season and event.</p>



<p>It had both cute illustrations drawn with color pencil, and the recipe notebook’s owner’s simple comments, and reading it got me excited.</p>



<p>I had opened it to precisely the page for summer recipes.</p>



<p>Along with a drawing of Tanabata decorations, there was a gorgeous illustration that grabbed my attention.</p>



<p>“Dishes for a summer day with clear skies&#8230;.&nbsp; Black Vinegar and Seasonings Chirashi Sushi&#8230;?”</p>



<p>I didn’t know why, but the recipe sounded extremely delicious.</p>



<p>It was different from the usual gomoku chirashi made with sushi rice and a mix of vegetables and fish.&nbsp; Here, it looked like you mixed seasonings such as Japanese ginger, perilla leaves, and more into sushi rice made with black vinegar.</p>



<p>You dressed it up with simmered conger eel and steamed shrimp, and parboiled pike eel, if you had them.&nbsp; Although I’d heard that pike eel was something that evoked summer in Kyoto, I’d never eaten it before&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Oh.&nbsp; Come to think of it, there’s the high-quality simmered eel that we got as a gift in the fridge.”</p>



<p>I’d been thinking about how to use it, but I’d turn it into a chirashi sushi ingredient.&nbsp; That was what I’d do.</p>



<p>House Minazuki was an old family, had deep ties to many houses and business associates, and received a lot of guests, plus there was the backdrop of its special business, so it got all kinds of presents and thank-you gifts.&nbsp; But because there hadn’t been anyone who could make use of them, it had been like casting pearls before swine.&nbsp; It was so with the black vinegar.&nbsp; There was a splendid bottle that had come from Kagoshima Prefecture in Kyushu.&nbsp; I’d been wondering what would happen when it came time for the mid-year and year-end gifts&#8230;.</p>



<p>All right.&nbsp; I’d get to work making the chirashi sushi at once.</p>



<p>According to the recipe notebook, you cooked the rice for the sushi rice in dashi broth.&nbsp; Up until now, I’d only made sushi rice with store-bought sushi vinegar, so this was the first time I was going to cook it this way.</p>



<p>I added dashi broth, kelp, and sake to the washed rice, placed it in the rice cooker, and set it to cook.</p>



<p>While the rice was cooking, I prepared the ingredients for the chirashi sushi.</p>



<p>According to the recipe notebook, it was the seasonings that played the leading role in this chirashi sushi.</p>



<p>Since Fumiya liked Japanese ginger and perilla leaves and grew them, I wanted to use lots of them.&nbsp; I cut up these two seasonings and set them aside to stir into the sushi rice later.</p>



<p>Although Japanese ginger was a common ingredient, I knew that not only the Japanese-food-loving You, but also Umi liked to eat it.&nbsp; It was an ingredient they’d eaten often from a very young age.&nbsp; To the point that Fumiya always made pickled Japanese ginger and kept it around for everyone to snack on.</p>



<p>For the other ingredients, I intended to use simmered conger eel and shredded egg crepe, and okra and cucumbers.</p>



<p>I sprinkled salt on the okra and rubbed them, removed the calyx, and sliced them.&nbsp; When I did so, the okra formed star-like shapes and were really cute.</p>



<p>For the cucumbers, I used “crescent moon gourds.”&nbsp;&nbsp; These were a vegetable originating in the Lunar World that the humans of House Minazuki often ate, and that were the deeply beloved food of the tsukimari kappa.&nbsp; They tasted almost entirely like cucumbers.&nbsp; I cut them into thin slices, sprinkled salt over them, and squeezed out the excess water.</p>



<p>Since the rice cooked with dashi broth was done, I took out the kelp and transferred the rice to a wooden sushi tub.</p>



<p>This rice smelled really good.&nbsp; The scent of dashi wafted up on the steam.</p>



<p>Following the recipe notebook, I combined black vinegar and sugar and salt, and I had sushi vinegar.&nbsp; I sprinkled it over the rice, and I mixed it in with cutting motions.&nbsp; In order to cool the faintly colored sushi rice, I fanned it with a round paper fan, and the fragrance of sushi rice enveloped me.&nbsp; Perhaps thanks to the black vinegar, the fragrance had a slight familiarity and a depth to it.</p>



<p>While the sushi rice cooled a little more in the tub, I covered it with a clean kitchen towel and set it aside.</p>



<p>Since all that was left was to mix in and sprinkle on the ingredients later, I’d make the other dishes during this time.</p>



<p>So.&nbsp; In the end, Fumiya’s favorite food was shrimp tempura!</p>

<p><em>Almost done now!  There&#8217;s just an epilogue left!</em></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“Whoa, that’s wicked.&nbsp; That looks super tasty.&nbsp; Did you make all of this, Rikka?”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; I did my best.”</p>



<p>As I served the deep-fried shrimp tempura onto a large platter, You came into the kitchen and peeked at the finished, steaming-hot dishes lined up there.&nbsp; Then he helped me move them to the sitting room.</p>



<p>There, with the veranda wide open, Fumiya and the tsukimari kappa were cleaning up the scattered sawdust.&nbsp; They finished up right at this moment.</p>



<p>Apparently, the tsukimari kappa would use the sawdust they’d gathered for their dens.</p>



<p>Saying that they’d make fluffy beds and so on, they were carrying it back enthusiastically.</p>



<span id="more-230"></span>



<p>When Fumiya saw that the dishes were coming out, he cheerfully went off to wash his hands.</p>



<p>“Oh, I’m hungry – “</p>



<p>At some point, Umi had sat down quietly in her usual spot and, in the face of all these dishes, her tummy was rumbling.</p>



<p>On the low table was an array of large platters with big helpings of shrimp tempura and Japanese tiger prawn sashimi.</p>



<p>And, inside the sushi tub, was the summer vegetable and seasonings chirashi sushi that I’d made while consulting the recipe notebook.&nbsp; It was studded with star-like okra slices, and maybe it was just me, but it had a Tanabata feel to it.&nbsp; The seasonings and simmered conger eel also whetted the appetite.</p>



<p>Apart from that, I’d prepared heaps of chilled tomatoes and shredded cabbage.</p>



<p>There was also a plate on which I’d arranged sliced perilla leaves and green onion, and lemon, for people to use as they pleased.</p>



<p>“I’ve deveined and shelled the raw Japanese tiger prawns, so please feel free to eat them dipped in soy sauce and wasabi.&nbsp; I made miso soup with the shrimp heads.”</p>



<p>You and Umi quickly ate the prawn sashimi with relish.</p>



<p>“Oh – , delicious – “ he said.</p>



<p>“Bliss ~ “ she said.</p>



<p>Actually, I’d taste-tested the prawns earlier in the kitchen, and they had a shockingly tender texture.&nbsp; They were unexpectedly sweet and delicious.</p>



<p>As for Fumiya, he was sitting crosslegged and looking interested in the shrimp tempura that was his favorite food.&nbsp; However, the tsukimari kappa Number 6 had scuttled up into the sitting room and was trying to climb onto his knees.&nbsp; Even though Fumiya held him back, he struggled desperately.</p>



<p>“I made tartar sauce and aurora sauce, so please feel free to dip the shrimp tempura in those and eat them.&nbsp; I seasoned them with salt and pepper, so they’re probably fine too if you just squeeze some lemon juice over them.”</p>



<p>I portioned several pieces of shrimp tempura onto a small plate and handed it to Fumiya.&nbsp; After that, I passed Number 6 the cut-off ends of the crescent moon gourds.</p>



<p>Saying, “Thank you,” Fumiya accepted the small plate of shrimp tempura.</p>



<p>While Number 6 sank into a reverie eating crescent moon gourds, Fumiya bit into a piece of shrimp tempura.&nbsp; For the first one, he only squeezed lemon juice onto it and ate it simply.</p>



<p>“How is it&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“It’s probably the best in the world.”</p>



<p>He gave me his candid, grand impression.</p>



<p>For sure, shrimp tempura made with Japanese tiger prawns had firm, crunchy flesh and a deep flavor.</p>



<p>Because I had made it from fresh prawns, I, too, had thought that it was the first time I’d had such delicious shrimp tempura when I’d taste-tested it.</p>



<p>I’d been saved by the quality of the ingredients.&nbsp; Above all else, I was glad that I’d been able to serve these on Fumiya’s birthday.</p>



<p>“I don’t know if I were able to make the chirashi sushi well, but I thought it had a Tanabata feel, and I gave it my best shot.&nbsp; Please have a test.”</p>



<p>This meant that I was portioning out the “Seasonings Black Vinegar Chirashi Sushi” from the sushi tub onto lacquered individual plates, and serving it.</p>



<p>I’d gently stirred chopped Japanese ginger and perilla leaves, and thinly sliced crescent moon gourds into the black vinegar sushi rice, and I’d topped it with shredded omelet and cut-up conger eel and slices of okra.</p>



<p>As all the tableware in this house was elegant and looked high quality, just using them raised the tastiness of the food by a third.</p>



<p>“I’m getting excited just looking at the chirashi sushi.&nbsp; It has a celebratory feel,” said You.</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s topped with conger eel!&nbsp; Give me lots of eel!” said Umi.</p>



<p>“Hey, see here, Umi, pay attention to your sleeves.&nbsp; You’re getting soy sauce on them,” said Fumiya.</p>



<p>After they passed around the plates, each of them put some Seasonings Black Vinegar Chirashi Sushi into their mouths.</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>And then, for some reason, all three went dead quiet.</p>



<p>“E–everyone?”</p>



<p>It was as I’d feared.</p>



<p>It was too ridiculously disgusting, wasn’t it?</p>



<p>Oh no.&nbsp; What should I do?&nbsp; I’d made some mistake in the process or with the seasonings, hadn’t I?!</p>



<p>I broke out into a cold sweat, and in a panic, I took a bite too, but I didn’t think that anything was wrong in particular.</p>



<p>If anything, I’d done a better job here than with any chirashi sushi I’d made up until now.</p>



<p>Because I’d cooked the rice with dashi broth and kelp, or because I’d used black vinegar.&nbsp; The sushi rice, which had depth and mellowness, and the refreshing aroma of the seasonings that I’d stirred in – that harmony was superb&#8230;.</p>



<p>However, if I’d been paying attention, tears were spilling down Umi’s face.</p>



<p>You, too, was looking down again, his eyes a little wet.</p>



<p>Turning his face away, Fumiya said, “I’m sorry.”&nbsp; I heard a slight teariness in his voice.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, Rikka,” he said.&nbsp; “It tastes so much like the chirashi sushi that Mother used to make.”</p>



<p>“Like your mother’s&#8230;chirashi sushi?”</p>



<p>And then, finally, I understood.</p>



<p>The recipe notebook that I’d found in the uppermost cupboard in the kitchen had belonged to Fumiya and You and Umi’s mother.</p>



<p>“Mother loved to cook,” said Fumiya.&nbsp; “Both Father and we kids – we all adored her home cooking.&nbsp; Mother adapted the traditional recipes that had been passed down in House Minazuki for generations to modernize them and make them easier for kids to eat, she made skillful use of the gifts that we received from all over the country, and, along with her love, she gave us plenty to eat.&nbsp; Thanks to that, we weren’t at all picky eaters, and all of us grew up healthy.”</p>



<p>Wiping the tears that were streaming down Umi’s face with a tissue, he furrowed his brow and smiled wryly.</p>



<p>“Was that the case,” I said.&nbsp; “Without knowing any of that, I made the recipe&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I returned to the kitchen and returned with the recipe notebook I’d found.</p>



<p>Fumiya and the others looked astonished, staring at that recipe notebook for a long, long time.</p>



<p>“Rikka,” he asked, “Where did you find this?”</p>



<p>“Oh – that – I found it in the highest cupboard in the kitchen.&nbsp; And then, when I was looking through the recipes, I thought that this chirashi sushi looked really good.”</p>



<p>I hadn’t realized that the notebook had belonged to their mother.</p>



<p>Even though, if I’d thought about it more, it could only have.&nbsp; Silly me&#8230;.</p>



<p>However, everyone had picked up their chopsticks once more and were eating.&nbsp; Their teary expressions gradually changing one by one into smiles, they told me, “It’s delicious, it’s delicious.”</p>



<p>They enjoyed not only the chirashi sushi, but also the other dishes.</p>



<p>Saying only that he loved shrimp tempura, Fumiya ate lots of it too.</p>



<p>I also ate more than usual.</p>



<p>Even though my belly was fuller than normal, that was common here.</p>



<p>There was no one here to blame me for it.&nbsp; It was truly a contented feeling of fullness.</p>



<p>I’d heard that for those of House Minazuki, food was very important in order to maintain their unique constitution and divine powers.&nbsp; Doubtless, Fumiya and the others’ mother, too, had been aware of that, and she’d cooked tons of delicious foods, and recorded their favorite ones in a recipe notebook.</p>



<p>So that someday, someone would inherit it&#8230;.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>After the meal, I went into the garden with renewed determination.</p>



<p>Onto the bamboo leaves that were already drooping under the weight of the paper strips we’d hung up during the day, I intended to hang one more strip on which I’d written a wish.</p>



<p>“Ah.&nbsp; The Milky Way&#8230;.”</p>



<p>From the grounds of House Minazuki, you could always see the beautiful starry sky at night, but I felt as if the stars shone even more brightly today.</p>



<p>Was it Tanabata that made it so?</p>



<p>Blown by the breeze, the bamboo leaves swished in a delicate, rustling song.</p>



<p>“Rikka, what’d you write?”</p>



<p>“Aaargh!”</p>



<p>All of a sudden, You’s voice came from behind me, shocking me so much I thought my heart would leap out of my chest.</p>



<p>“‘Dressing.’&nbsp; ‘Cooking.’&nbsp; ‘Smiling’.” he read.&nbsp; “&#8230;What’s this secret code?”</p>



<p>“They’re connected to my next goals.”</p>



<p>“They’re connected, you say, but aren’t they memos?”</p>



<p>At some point, Umi was also standing next to me, looking at the paper strip.</p>



<p>As for that, You’s “Long life” and Umi’s “Games” were similar.</p>



<p>I thought that they weren’t ones to talk about me&#8230;.</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>A little ways away from us, Fumiya was staring up at the night sky.</p>



<p>Was he gazing at the Milky Way?&nbsp; Or was he gazing at the Moon?</p>



<p>For a split second, Father’s figure overlapped on top of Fumiya’s, but it faded at once.</p>



<p>It was only Fumiya there, and just at the sight of him lingering in the breeze, my heart clenched.</p>



<p>As if drawn to him, I headed over to him.</p>



<p>“Um, Fumiya.”</p>



<p>“Rikka.”</p>



<p>“The – you can see the Milky Way clearly, from here.”</p>



<p>Fumiya nodded slowly and looked up at tonight’s stars once more.</p>



<p>Then, in a voice that carried well in this serene atmosphere, he said, “Rikka.&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Since you came here, our family has had more opportunities to gather around the dining table.&nbsp; After Mother left this house, we siblings have hardly eaten together&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Up until recently, the siblings weren’t a family who were close to one another and prepared food together.&nbsp; Rather, it sounded as if they often made time for meals separately and ate by themselves.</p>



<p>Even though I’d only just come to this house, Fumiya’s words made me very happy, and filled me with sadness.</p>



<p>I was merely trying my best at what I was capable of doing, and I had vowed to repay the kindness of everyone in this family.</p>



<p>“Um, Fumiya.&nbsp; Happy eighteenth birthday.”</p>



<p>Once again, I expressed my best wishes.&nbsp; It was so late now that Fumiya stared blankly.</p>



<p>Still, I thought that I needed to convey what I felt at this moment.</p>



<p>Facing Fumiya once more, I looked up into his face.</p>



<p>“Do you remember what happened on the day I turned sixteen?&nbsp; That day, you came to pick me up, and you wished me happy birthday.&nbsp; Up until that moment, I – I’d forgotten it was the day I was born.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Rikka.”</p>



<p>My rebirth had begun on that day.</p>



<p>Without even realizing it, I’d joined hands with my future family.</p>



<p>“Now I’m glad to be alive, I’m glad to be here&#8230;that’s how I feel.&nbsp; Because you gave me the most genuine words of affirmation in the world.”</p>



<p>– Thank you for being born.</p>



<p>We had met, so that we might spend the rest of our lives saying that to each other, until our dying days.</p>



<p>We stared at each other.&nbsp; All at once, I felt as if I’d said something ridiculously embarrassing, and both my cheeks and my whole head grew hot.</p>



<p>My face must have turned as red as an apple.</p>



<p>Although, if he couldn’t see that in the moonlight, it was fine&#8230;.</p>



<p>“By chance, are you feeling self-conscious?” he asked.</p>



<p>“Ye–yes.&nbsp; I’m ridiculously embarrassed&#8230;.”</p>



<p>In the end, Fumiya caught me out.&nbsp; <em>Don’t stare at my face</em>, I thought.</p>



<p>“Haha.”</p>



<p>Fumiya covered his mouth with his hand and laughed a rare, loud laugh.</p>



<p>“You really are cute.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Ooh, it was too much.</p>



<p>Fumiya’s frontal assault tactic was alive and well.</p>



<p>Since he had spoken without hesitation, I didn’t know how long my heart would last.</p>



<p>As if to hold back my pounding heart, I clasped my hands in front of my chest and squeezed as if I were praying.</p>



<p>And, at this moment, I thought that I could comprehend the words that Fumiya had spoken to me in the very beginning as well.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“I believe that even in this marriage that we’re bound to by the destiny of blood, we can still find love.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Truly, it was so.&nbsp; At least, I had found love, and I also knew what was to come.</p>



<p>Now that I knew that emotion, I could no longer return to the time when I had not known it.</p>



<p>Progressing at the same time, love and youth and marriage shone brightly.</p>



<p>A vivid as a kaleidoscope, they reverberated loudly and ran through my everyday life.</p>



<p>Gazing up at the sky, facing the countless stars that flowed along the Heavenly Stream and the one and only Moon, I made my wish.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Somehow, let this – my love –</p>



<p>Let it be tied to your happiness and a life full of laughter.</p>
