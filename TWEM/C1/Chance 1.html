<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 1: The Sixth of June</h2>



<p>The sixth of June.&nbsp; The weather forecast: cloudy skies followed by rain.</p>



<p>Dad once taught me something.</p>



<p>In the lunar calendar, the sixth month is called “Minazuki,” or the “Month of Water.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“By the way, I wonder what disease Mr. Minazuki had?”</p>



<p>“It sounded like a really weird disease.&nbsp; I only heard this but&#8230;glowing stones grew out of his skin, and his body dried up like a mummy.&nbsp; They say that&#8217;s why no one was invited to a wake or funeral.”</p>



<p>“Huh?&nbsp; What the heck is that?&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never heard of such a disease.”</p>



<p>“I wonder what his daughter Rikka will do now.&nbsp; See, their family was just father and daughter.”</p>



<p>“At a time like this, I wonder if her mother will come for her.”</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s not going to happen.&nbsp; They say Rikka&#8217;s mother abused her.&nbsp; Rumor has it that that&#8217;s why they got divorced.”</p>



<p>“Whoa, really?&nbsp; What a horrible story&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Dressed in mourning clothes, our neighbors and my father&#8217;s coworkers buzzed with conversation as they exited the packed ceremony hall.</p>



<p>Some conversations seemed sympathetic, others gossipy.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I also heard their voices&#8230;.</p>



<span id="more-23"></span>



<p>In the middle of April, Dad died from a mysterious disease.</p>



<p>He was in no condition for me to invite people a wake or funeral like normal, so today I had invited his acquaintances to the Buddhist memorial service held forty-nine days after his death, and arranged for a simple ceremony.</p>



<p>“Rikka, I&#8217;m going to make a quick call to my family.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you rest here for a bit.&#8221;</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yes.”</p>



<p>After the service, thanks to my landlady, who had to take care of something, I rested for a little while on a chair in the entryway.&nbsp; It looked like the taxi that was picking me up was late.</p>



<p>I was tired and had a vague sense that I wanted to be alone, so this was just right.</p>



<p>“&#8230;What am I going to do with Dad&#8217;s ashes.”</p>



<p>These days, that was all I thought about.&nbsp; On my knees, stored in a box, was the urn.</p>



<p>Even though we had welcomed his forty-nine days, I couldn&#8217;t lay his ashes to rest.&nbsp; There was no tomb to accept them.</p>



<p>Because Dad had cut all ties with his relatives, I didn&#8217;t know his family or even his hometown.</p>



<p>I wondered if I couldn&#8217;t just keep his ashes with me all the time&#8230;.</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>By chance, I noticed the hydrangeas blooming in the ceremony hall&#8217;s garden.</p>



<p>The sky looked threatening, but I only planned to take a quick look at the flowers.&nbsp; Holding the urn box, I went out of the entryway.</p>



<p>Large blue and purple hydrangea blossoms were scattered among the fresh green leaves.</p>



<p>In fact, today, the sixth of June, was my sixteenth birthday.</p>



<p>Although the venue was also only available today, perhaps the reason I&#8217;d held my father&#8217;s forty-ninth day service today was that all I wanted to do was to forget this day.</p>



<p>“Ah&#8230;.”</p>



<p>A light drizzle started.</p>



<p>It slowly got harder, and even though both Dad&#8217;s urn box and I were getting soaked, my body refused to move.</p>



<p>I felt an incoherent unease about the future.</p>



<p>Right after my father died, for some reason it didn&#8217;t feel that real, but if you wanted to call it sadness, then I was sad.&nbsp; There was so much to do that I didn&#8217;t think too deeply about many things.</p>



<p>However, steadily.&nbsp; And then, all of a sudden.</p>



<p>After a month had passed, a sense of loss and loneliness came upon me, as if I were sinking into a deep hole.</p>



<p>Today, now that the service marking the end of mourning was over, I had to consider the practical matter of my future.</p>



<p>From now on, what I would do.&nbsp; Where I would go.</p>



<p><em>I want to go home.</em></p>



<p><em>I want desperately to go home to somewhere.</em></p>



<p>But where?</p>



<p>From today on, I would only go home on my own to a lonely house, carrying my father&#8217;s ashes.</p>



<p>Before long, I would leave even that house.</p>



<p>Already, I had almost finished packing, so I would probably go to an orphanage that was not too far away.&nbsp; Because, at this point, I didn&#8217;t have a single relative who could take me in.</p>



<p>Besides Dad, I didn&#8217;t have any family.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t have anyone who loved me.</p>



<p>&#8230;No.</p>



<p>Actually, had Dad loved me?</p>



<p>What had his final words been?</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>All of a sudden, the back of my left hand throbbed with pain.&nbsp; With a frown, I checked it.</p>



<p>Dotted across the back of my left hand grew the most beautiful turquoise stones in the world.</p>



<p>This was <em>the same symptom as that of the disease that had killed my father</em>.</p>



<p>“&#8230;They&#8217;ve gotten bigger since yesterday,” I murmured in a detached way.</p>



<p>I hadn&#8217;t yet told anyone that I had caught the same disease as my father.</p>



<p>Even if I told anyone, there was nothing they could do.</p>



<p>These stones would increase in number, get bigger, and grow, sucking both blood and water from my body as nutrients.</p>



<p>Then my body would no longer be able to move, and I would shrivel up and die.&nbsp; I knew that.</p>



<p>Because I had watched Dad suffer from this disease the whole time.</p>



<p>“I wonder if I too&#8230;will die soon.”</p>



<p>If so, there was no need to worry about the future at all.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“If you are about to die, won&#8217;t you come to my home?”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>– What?</p>



<p>A dignified voice echoed through my ears, leaving a strong impression.</p>



<p>When I turned around, surprised and drenched by the rain, there stood a young man in mourning clothes.&nbsp; He tilted an umbrella towards me.</p>



<p>In contrast with the black of his mourning clothes, his handsome face was pale.</p>



<p>He had clear, bright eyes.&nbsp; He had a single, striking mole under his right eye.</p>



<p>His beauty, which carried concern, made me stiffen instead.</p>



<p>Who was he?&nbsp; He seemed to have left the Floating World, as if he weren&#8217;t a human at all.</p>



<p>“It is a pleasure to meet you, Miss Rikka Minazuki.&nbsp; I am the fifty-fifth Head of House Minazuki.&nbsp; My name is Fumiya Minazuki.”</p>



<p>With a self-composed atmosphere, the young man bowed his head.&nbsp; An adult man waiting in attendance behind him also bowed his head in the same way.</p>



<p>Although I didn&#8217;t remember these people at all, the fine, silver-silk-like hair of the young man before me somehow reminded me of my father.&nbsp; It stirred up the feelings in my chest even more.</p>



<p>Somehow, in a strangely comfortable, calm, and clear voice, I said to him, “Minazuki&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“I share a great-grandfather with you, making us second cousins.”</p>



<p>Second cousins.</p>



<p>In short, that made us fairly distant relatives, right?</p>



<p>This was the first time since I was born that I had met my own relatives.</p>



<p>“Miss Rikka.&nbsp; If you have no place to go, won&#8217;t you come to the Minazuki main family?”</p>



<p>At his unexpected words, my head went blank, and I couldn&#8217;t get any words out immediately.</p>



<p>Then I openly averted my gaze.&nbsp; Hugging the urn box, as if there were something scary in front of me, I backed up a few steps.</p>



<p>“Oh&#8230;, are the two of you, human?”</p>



<p>I thought I&#8217;d asked a strange question.&nbsp; However:</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; We are not yokai or ayakashi.&nbsp; Although, like you and Mr. Rikuzou, we are <em>people with the sight</em>.”</p>



<p>At the young man&#8217;s response, my eyes slowly opened wide.</p>



<p>His sharp eyes noticed that there was something strange about my hand.</p>



<p>“&#8230;There are stones on that hand.”</p>



<p>“Oh.”</p>



<p>Panicking, I shoved my left hand behind my back and tried to hide it.</p>



<p>However, in a firm tone, the young man said, “Please show it to me.”</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t know why, but I felt like I could not defy those words.&nbsp; Obediently, I held out my left hand.</p>



<p>Without any hesitation, he touched it and drew it towards himself.</p>



<p>“How long has it been?”</p>



<p>“Um&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“How long have you had these turquoise stones?”</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s see, when was it?&nbsp; For sure, the first time I&#8217;d noticed them was&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Th-the morning of the day after&#8230;Dad died&#8230;,” I wavered, my hand claimed by the young man, my eyes swimming with tears.</p>



<p>In the beginning, they&#8217;d looked like glittery grains of sand, and I&#8217;d wondered if they were my imagination.&nbsp; But they had slowly grown larger, and now they were the size of grains of rice.</p>



<p>The young man before me fixed his eyes on me in a stare.</p>



<p>Then he exchanged a brief glance with the man behind him and told me, “In fact, this disease is called the `Moon&#8217;s Return Disease&#8217; and is developed only by the Minazuki family.&nbsp; In an ordinary hospital, it cannot be treated.&nbsp; However, because your case is still in the early stages, you can recover completely under the Minazuki treatment.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Huh?”</p>



<p>I stared blankly.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d heard that it was an unknown disease.&nbsp; Whatever doctors we&#8217;d seen had thrown up their hands.</p>



<p>In spite of that, what in the world was this young man saying?</p>



<p>A disease developed only by the Minazuki family?</p>



<p>The possibility of a complete recovery under the Minazuki treatment?</p>



<p>“I–I don&#8217;t think I particularly want to live a long life.&nbsp; Because, if I die, it will not trouble anyone anymore&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Shaking my head, withdrawing my hand, and clinging to my father&#8217;s urn box, I turned my back on the young man.&nbsp; Exactly as if I were a snail that had been touched, that recoiled at the sensation and immediately shut itself up in its shell.</p>



<p><em>It&#8217;s fine if I don&#8217;t get treated.&nbsp; It&#8217;s fine if I die.</em></p>



<p><em>After this, I will only be alone, although I don&#8217;t know how I can go on living.</em></p>



<p>“If you were to die, it would trouble <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>However, as if to block out my thoughts as I gave up, the young man addressed me in a voice that carried clearly.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“Miss Rikka Minazuki.&nbsp; Although you may not know this, you and I are betrothed.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>&#8230;What?</p>



<p>Thinking that I must have misheard, naturally I turned back.</p>



<p>But the young man before me had a reassuring look about him. He regarded me with such sincerity that I couldn&#8217;t believe he was lying.</p>



<p>Betrothed.&nbsp; Betrothed meant&#8230;.</p>



<p>That definitely meant someone whom you promised to marry.</p>



<p>Even though I didn&#8217;t know anything anymore and could find no meaning in living on, those words seemed to forcibly hold me to “life.”</p>



<p>“That –, yikes!&nbsp; Your frontal assault, Bon.&nbsp; You should probably tell her that story after everything calms down!&nbsp; With this tone, I don&#8217;t see any hope for love&#8217;s battlefield tactics ~.”</p>



<p>“Be quiet, Koutarou.&nbsp; Remember where you are.”</p>



<p>In a monotone, the young man rebuked the man behind him, who was groaning and at his wits&#8217; end.</p>



<p>I seemed to have gone as stiff as a patron god, unable to so much as blink.</p>



<p>During that time, even the world shifted.&nbsp; The rain picked up, and a ray of light pierced between the clouds.</p>



<p>Struck by that gentle light, even the hydrangea blossoms, which were covered in raindrops, sparkled&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Oh.”&nbsp; “Oh.”</p>



<p>In front of those two people, hugging my father&#8217;s urn box tight, I suddenly collapsed.</p>



<p>Everything was just too, too much.&nbsp; I&#8217;d hit my limit.</p>



<p>My head felt fuzzy, my body hot.&nbsp; I lost consciousness.</p>



<p>Rikka, Rikka, someone was calling, but his voice also faded away.</p>



<p>However, there was something that I did know.</p>



<p>Any hope was useless.&nbsp; In this day and age, whoever heard of a <em>betrothed</em>&#8230;.</p>



<p>It was probably laughable, wasn&#8217;t it, that I broke at the last minute.</p>



<span id="more-30"></span>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Once, in a certain place, there lived the son and heir of a noble family.</p>



<p>Although a betrothed had been chosen for him in childhood, he fell in love with a different woman whom he met in college, and he wished to marry her.</p>



<p>However, his family and all his kin violently opposed his marrying that woman.&nbsp; The man cut all ties with his family and rushed out of his home.&nbsp; It was what you call an elopement.</p>



<p>Months and years passed, and the man and woman were blessed with twin girls.</p>



<p>Then they built a warm home and led a fortunate life.&nbsp; And they lived happily ever after.&nbsp;</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>If that had been the case, how wonderful it would have been.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;But it didn&#8217;t go as in a fairytale.&nbsp; This was reality.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The woman, for whom the man had thrown away everything so he could marry her, could not bring herself to love one of their daughters, no matter what.&nbsp; She often compared the twins.&nbsp; She doted on the older sister alone, and she instinctively hated the younger sister, rejected her, and persecuted her.</p>



<p>&nbsp;In order to protect the younger twin, the man divorced his wife, took that child, and left their home.</p>



<p>&nbsp;– Several years later.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The man and that daughter were leading a quiet, humble life.</p>



<p>&nbsp;However, the man developed an unknown disease and died at the age of forty-two.</p>



<p>&nbsp;That was the life of my father, Rikuzou Minazuki.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>When I came to, I was lying on a futon.&nbsp; In the dark, I looked up at the ceiling.</p>



<p>Through the wide-open veranda, I could see the thin crescent moon floating in the clear night sky.&nbsp; After the daytime rain, the night was so bright that it felt like a lie.</p>



<p>There was a mysterious smell.&nbsp; A calming fragrance that seemed both bitter and sweet.</p>



<p>I wondered if I&#8217;d slept pretty soundly.</p>



<p>Somehow, I felt refreshed.&nbsp; Ever since my father died, I hadn&#8217;t been able to sleep well&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Are you awake?”</p>



<p>The voice came from right next to me.&nbsp; With an inward start, I turned my head that way.</p>



<p>Sitting there quietly was the young man I had just met.</p>



<p>I went stiff and, as if bound in place, stared up at him.</p>



<p>Because my night vision was unusually good, even though there was no source of light but the moonlight, I could see his figure clearly.&nbsp; His night vision seemed to be the same, and he stared back into my eyes.</p>



<p>His name, I believed, was Fumiya Minazuki.&nbsp; He had said that he was my second cousin.</p>



<p>Under the moonlight, his silver silk-like hair and the long eyelashes that brushed his cheeks beneath his downcast eyes seemed more and more mysterious.&nbsp; The boy had the handsome features of a being who had left the floating world, so much so that in the beginning, I had thought that he wasn&#8217;t human.</p>



<p>Already he had removed his mourning clothes and wore a light grey kimono and haori.&nbsp; He sat in proper Japanese fashion, with his legs folded under himself and his back straight.</p>



<p>That posture was elegant, and the aura that surrounded him was completely different from that of my boy classmates.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, he had said that he was the Head of the main family.</p>



<p>The Head was the person with the highest position in that family.&nbsp; Although Dad had said that the family he&#8217;d left was distinguished and old, it was true.</p>



<p>“Oh&#8230;!”</p>



<p>My consciousness became clear, and I sprang up from the futon.</p>



<p>“I, I, Dad&#8217;s ashes&#8230;.”</p>



<p>After all, I&#8217;d abandoned everything after the memorial service.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s all right, calm down, please.&nbsp; The ashes are by your pillow, and you can entrust other matters to the Minazuki family as well.&nbsp; As for you, that hand must be treated immediately.”</p>



<p>As I trembled, Fumiya soothed me in a cool tone.&nbsp; His expression did not change.</p>



<p>When I turned, my father&#8217;s urn box had indeed been placed next to my pillow.&nbsp; Besides:</p>



<p>“Treating my hand&#8230;.”</p>



<p>With a gasp, I looked at the back of my left hand.</p>



<p>Dotted across it, the turquoise stones that grew on it glowed faintly in the dark.</p>



<p>Ah, that was right.&nbsp; Although I had caught the same disease as Dad, the person named Fumiya Minazuki had come to me and told me that he could cure it.</p>



<p>He had told me that if I died, <em>he</em> would be troubled.</p>



<p>“Um.&nbsp; What time is it?”</p>



<p>“It is eight in the evening.”</p>



<p>“Where am I?”</p>



<p>“This is one of House Minazuki&#8217;s vacation homes.&nbsp; As for its location, we are still in Tokyo.”</p>



<p>“I, what happened to me?&nbsp; Will I die&#8230;after all?”</p>



<p>“No, you will not die.&nbsp; I will not let you die.”</p>



<p>Why did he care about me that much&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Now I will remove the stones from the back of your hand.&nbsp; Show me your left hand, please.”</p>



<p>Once he mentioned removing them, I started to worry that it would hurt.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I held out my left hand as he&#8217;d said to.</p>



<p>Fumiya took a wet cloth out of a pail next to him.</p>



<p>The water in the pail was dyed a pale green.&nbsp; Was this the true identity of the bittersweet fragrance that had been wafting through the air for a little while now?</p>



<p>“&#8230;Fumiya.&nbsp; What is that?”</p>



<p>It was the first time I had addressed him by name.&nbsp; Fumiya cast a glance at me, and then lowered his gaze again.</p>



<p>“It is a cloth that has been soaked in the juice from a special medicinal herb.&nbsp; Now I will wrap this around your hand.&nbsp; Although it may go somewhat numb, that will be proof that the medicine is working, so please endure it for a short time.&nbsp; Gradually, the roots of the stones will float to the surface.”</p>



<p>I had no idea what it would feel like to have the roots of the stones float to the surface.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d often heard rumors of quack treatments and such.&nbsp; If this were one, what should I do&#8230;.</p>



<p>My worry increased more and more, but Fumiya&#8217;s expression was serious.&nbsp; He wrapped the herb-soaked cloth around my left hand.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Oh!”</p>



<p>With a gasp, I opened my eyes wide, because that hand had definitely gone numb.&nbsp; It felt like the warm herbal brew covering my hand was steadily seeping into it.</p>



<p>Although the pain wasn&#8217;t unbearable, it felt hot.&nbsp; Did the tingling numbness really come from the herbal brew working?</p>



<p>After five minutes, Fumiya removed the cloth wrapped around my hand.</p>



<p>When he did so, to my shock, the turquoise stones growing on the back of my hand had indeed floated to the surface.</p>



<p>Either they were swelling up more than at the start, or they were flying out.</p>



<p>“Why?&nbsp; Until just now, they were buried very deep&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“The plant used in the medicinal brew is a natural enemy of these stones.&nbsp; When the medicinal brew soaked in, the stones tried to escape and floated to the surface.”</p>



<p>“They&#8217;re stones, but they try to escape?”</p>



<p>“To be accurate, these are not stones but plants.”</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t know anything about anything anymore.</p>



<p>Fumiya took my hand once more and, with practiced motions, removed the stones using a pincer-like tool.&nbsp; It was completely as if he were pulling out splinters.&nbsp; Or removing fish bones.</p>



<p>Although it hurt only a bit, I was shocked.</p>



<p>Because, in my father&#8217;s case, the stones would not come out, no matter what.</p>



<p>All they did was grow large and increase in number.&nbsp; How in the world could they come out easily like this?</p>



<p>“These stones can be removed so easily because you are in the earliest phase, before they grow deep roots.&nbsp; &#8230;Please have a look at this.”</p>



<p>While Fumiya answered my unspoken question, he held one up with the pincers.</p>



<p>Without realizing it, I yelped, “Oh!”</p>



<p>The stone that he&#8217;d pulled out was growing a thin, short, root-like object.&nbsp; When the moonlight shone on the root, it, too, glowed faintly.</p>



<p>“Nonetheless, as it has been over a month since the onset of the disease, to be honest, we were barely in time.&nbsp; If the root had grown any deeper, this option would not have been readily available.”</p>



<p>In the darkened room, you couldn&#8217;t miss those small, glowing stones.</p>



<p>When he had removed the last one, Fumiya applied an ointment-like substance to the back of my left hand, which was pockmarked with holes.&nbsp; Then he wrapped a white bandage over it.</p>



<p>He worked by the light of the moon alone.&nbsp; Time passed without a word.</p>



<p>It was the first time that a boy close to me in age had touched my hand for such a long period.</p>



<p>“This will be fine now.&nbsp; You will need to take medicine for the time being, and it will be a long time before you recover completely, but I will monitor it, so please do not worry.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Um.&nbsp; Who in the world are you?” I asked, pressing the hand that Fumiya had released to my chest.</p>



<p>It was the only thing I could think of asking.</p>



<p>A strange disease that whatever hospital we&#8217;d gone to had given up on.&nbsp; A young man who knew that method of treatment.</p>



<p>Even though, from his appearance, he truly looked like a young person who was only about two or three years older than I.</p>



<p>Fumiya looked down briefly.</p>



<p>“In order to answer that question, first I must tell you about House Minazuki.”</p>



<p>He turned towards me, placed his hands on the tatami, and bowed his head deeply.</p>



<p>“Although it is a long story, won&#8217;t you please listen to it.&nbsp; It concerns matters of our House Minazuki.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Matters?”</p>



<p>Fumiya slowly lifted his face and fixed his gaze on me.</p>



<p>The moon was behind him.</p>



<p>“I will cut to the chase.&nbsp; We Minazuki are connected to the celestial maidens depicted in folktales about robes of feathers.&nbsp; We are descendants of <em>a maiden who descended from the Moon</em>.”</p>

<p>A celestial maiden –</p>



<p>When I heard that, the image that came to my mind was of a figure who existed in folklore and children’s tales, who floated in the sky like a goddess, clad in a robe of feathers.</p>



<p>I couldn’t accept all at once that House Minazuki was the descendants of a celestial maiden.</p>



<p>To tell the story in more detail, Fumiya and I moved to the room next door, where the lights were on.</p>



<p>There, an adult man in a suit was smoking a cigarette, but when he realized that we had arrived, he raised his voice in an, “Oh,” stubbed out the cigarette in an ashtray, and stood up.</p>



<p>Ah, this man was the one who had stood behind Fumiya at the ceremony hall.</p>



<p>His dark brown hair was slicked back with wax, and his appearance was very stylish and mature, but he turned to me and gave me the most pleasant smile imaginable.</p>



<p>“Rikka, those stones on your hand have come out cleanly.&nbsp; Thank goodness, thank goodness.”</p>



<p>I didn’t how how to respond, so as a backup, I bowed my head.</p>



<p>Then Fumiya and I sat down together on floor cushions that had been prepared for us and faced each other.</p>



<p>I got a little nervous about wearing only a yukata.&nbsp; Or, rather, when had I changed into a yukata?</p>



<p>This place was bright and different from just now, and it had a formal feel.&nbsp; I thought that I must be disheveled from just waking up.</p>



<p>“To introduce myself properly, I am the fifty-fifth Head of House Minazuki.&nbsp; My name is Fumiya Minazuki.&nbsp; In addition, this man is called Koutarou Minazuki.”</p>



<span id="more-36"></span>



<p>“As the Head has graciously introduced me, my name is Koutarou Minazuki.&nbsp; I am a member of a cadet branch.&nbsp; Well, at the moment I might seem like his attendant.”</p>



<p>Waiting behind Fumiya, Koutarou faced me and bowed his head deeply while greeting me cheerfully.&nbsp; Even though I didn’t understand the part about main and cadet branches, he had the same family name, so I wondered if normally I would just call him a relative.</p>



<p>“As I said earlier, we Minazuki are a family descended from a celestial maiden.&nbsp; Rikka, you are familiar with the robe of feathers folklore, are you not?” Fumiya asked me.</p>



<p>That was the old children’s tale that everyone saw or heard, in a picture book or elsewhere, at least once, right?</p>



<p>“Um, you’re talking about the celestial maiden who bathes in a river, gets her robe of feathers stolen, and can’t return to the heavens&#8230;.&nbsp; That fairy tale, right?”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; To talk about it in a little more detail, the place to which the celestial maiden could not return was the world of the Moon.&nbsp; We call it the `Lunar World.’&nbsp; They say that afterwards, the celestial maiden married the man who had claimed her robe of feathers, bore children, and lived as a human.&nbsp; Depending on the tale, it may also be said that she finds her robe of feathers and returns to the heavens, but&#8230;in reality, that was not the case.&nbsp; The celestial maiden could not return to the Moon, and so she died yearning for it.”</p>



<p>Somehow, I felt as if the story had taken an unexpected direction.</p>



<p>“The disease that you and Mr. Rikuzou developed is the same as the one that our ancestress the celestial maiden caught.&nbsp; It is called the ‘Moon’s Return Disease.’&nbsp; It is the disease that the Minazuki family, which bears the blood of the celestial maiden, has continued to suffer from for a thousand years.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;The Moon’s Return Disease’.”</p>



<p>Speaking of that, he had taught me that name when we met, too.</p>



<p>“The reason is that what are called small ‘seeds’ dwell in the bodies of we who inherit the celestial maiden’s blood.&nbsp; Those spout and grow turquoise stones in the body.&nbsp; Before long, you are held captive by delusions, both your heart and body wither and are exhausted, you become like a cast-off shell, and they cause your death&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Although the people of our Earth might think those stones are only minerals, in the Lunar World, they are plants.&nbsp; If you are a Minazuki, you have those seeds dwelling in your body.&nbsp; There are those who live their entire lives without the seeds sprouting, but once they have sprouted one time, there is a threat of recurrence.&nbsp; Therefore, you must continue to drink a medicine to suppress them.”</p>



<p>I opened my mouth halfway, and listened in silence.</p>



<p>Still, I probably managed to swallow the topic only because I had just seen Fumiya’s treatment.&nbsp; Those stones had indeed had root-like objects, and they had glowed faintly when the moonlight shone on them.&nbsp; If I hadn’t seen that, doubtless I wouldn’t have believed a word.</p>



<p>“I apologize for forcing you to listen to an obscure tale.&nbsp; However, do not worry.&nbsp; I <em>must</em> protect you.&nbsp; As I said a short while ago, you and I are betrothed.”</p>



<p>At the word “betrothed,” I gave a start.</p>



<p>Even though many things had happened and I had forgotten about it, that was right.</p>



<p>When we had met, this person had also said that our relationship was that of a betrothed couple.</p>



<p>“I &#8211; I don’t understand.&nbsp; Why in the world are we betrothed?&nbsp; In the first place, who decided on their own to&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“The decision was made by your father, Mr. Rikuzou, and by myself.”</p>



<p>“What?&nbsp; Dad&#8230;?”</p>



<p>But Dad had cut ties with his relatives.&nbsp; In spite of that, why?</p>



<p>“About one year ago, Mr. Rikuzou paid a visit to the main family.”</p>



<p>As if he had read my question from my expression, Fumiya answered it.</p>



<p>“At that time, Mr. Rikuzou had been invaded by the Moon’s Return Disease and was already in a stage that would have been difficult to treat.&nbsp; It seemed that from the start, he had no intention of treating it.”</p>



<p>Fumiya checked my expression briefly, gave me a moment, and continued.</p>



<p>“Only, what concerned Mr. Rikuzou were your affairs, Rikka.&nbsp; As you had inherited the blood of House Minazuki, even if you cut ties with that family, you would not be able to escape fate of that blood.&nbsp; Mr. Rikuzou feared that someday, the Minazuki curse might come down on you.”</p>



<p>The Minazuki curse&#8230;meaning this disease?</p>



<p>“Mr. Rikuzou said that he wished to entrust your affairs to me.&nbsp; Therefore, I told him that if we were to get married, I could protect you for your entire life.&nbsp; That was how we made that deal.”</p>



<p>“Why&#8230;?”</p>



<p>I didn’t understand the meaning.&nbsp; Why had Dad done it?</p>



<p>“Why you and me?&nbsp; Someone like me&#8230;.”</p>



<p>To be honest, I couldn’t understand why Fumiya would go so far.&nbsp; I thought that he must have any number of potential fiancées with much better backgrounds than mine.&nbsp; I wasn’t bringing a single thing to this marriage.</p>



<p>“As a matter of fact, Mr. Rikuzou was the eldest child of the main family&#8230;.&nbsp; He was the legitimate heir to the main family.”</p>



<p>As if he had read my question again, Fumiya continued speaking in a detached tone.</p>



<p>“When Mr. Rikuzou left the family, the main family was confronted with a succession problem.&nbsp; Much happened, and my father, who was a member of a cadet branch, became the adopted son of the main family, and now I hold the seat of the Head.&nbsp; Consequently, I have not inherited the blood of the legitimate main family.&nbsp; For House Minazuki, it has significance.&nbsp; The eldest child of the main family bears extraordinary power in that <em>blood</em>.”</p>



<p>Did that mean that&#8230;because my father had left the family, Fumiya had to marry me in order to restore the legitimate blood to the main family?</p>



<p>I really didn’t understand what he meant about the blood of the eldest child of the main family bearing power.</p>



<p>&nbsp;But Fumiya had an extremely serious look.&nbsp; As if, for some reason, he felt completely sorry over this marriage.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“I realize that you will not be able to trust me immediately.&nbsp; However, I hope that in order to survive, you will come with me to the main family, please.&nbsp; I hope that you can accept this engagement to me.&nbsp; To state it bluntly, there is no other way for you to survive.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;I thought that Fumiya seemed not to be using evasive language on purpose.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Provided that you accept it, the main family will guarantee all aspects of your life from this point on.&nbsp; I do not mind if we wait until we are both adults before we formally marry.&nbsp; Right now, you will simply come to the main family with me as my betrothed.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;I couldn’t say anything.&nbsp; Had the blood drained from my face?&nbsp; Did I wear a terrified expression?</p>



<p>Somewhat diffidently, he averted his gaze.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“It is &#8211; unpleasant &#8211; after all, isn’t it.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8230;Unpleasant?</p>



<p>&nbsp;My mind had gone blank, and because of that, I tried to focus solely on whether getting engaged to him would be unpleasant.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I didn’t feel any sense of unpleasantness.&nbsp; Or, rather, I felt nothing.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Since I hardly knew anything about Fumiya, I also didn’t feel like this was really happening.</p>



<p>&nbsp;However, when I considered what to do after this, I really didn’t have any other choices.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I knew that I couldn’t live all by myself from now on, and if I had caught a unique disease, I needed to borrow the strength of House Minazuki to treat it.&nbsp; Yet&#8230;.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I lowered my head and buried my face in my hands.</p>



<p>&nbsp;It wasn’t because I was sad.&nbsp; It was only that I was covering my eyes and wracking my brain to figure out what I should do from now on.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Did I want to extend my life until I married this person?</p>



<p>&nbsp;What did living mean?</p>



<p>&nbsp;“&#8230;It is not unpleasant.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;I slowly lifted my head from my hands and looked at the boy my father had chosen.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Rather, I think that I appreciate hearing this story.&nbsp; That I am overly fortunate.&nbsp; Because I’m bringing absolutely nothing&#8230;.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;As I spoke, both my voice and my body trembled.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Why were they trembling?&nbsp; Didn’t that make it look as if, deep down, I detested this talk of an engagement?</p>



<p>&nbsp;It was only that I felt grateful for this discussion, and intense shame at myself.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If I were a strong girl with more self-confidence and a will to live, I would doubtless reject this talk of engagement.&nbsp; I would declare that I would decide my future myself, that I would stand on my own two feet, that I would find the person I was fated to marry myself.</p>



<p>&nbsp;However, I merely accepted the preparations that had been laid for me, and welcomed them.</p>



<p>&nbsp;What an unappealing, uninteresting, easily-ignored, weak-willed woman I was.</p>



<p>&nbsp;This person who had to marry me like this&#8230;.&nbsp; I pitied Fumiya.</p>



<p>&nbsp; “I apologize.&nbsp; That this&#8230;gives the impression that I am removing obstacles from my path&#8230;.”</p>



<p>&nbsp; Fumiya again wore an expression of regret, and he clenched his fists on his knees.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Doubtless you’re thinking that you wanted to fall in love the normal way and marry a partner you love.&nbsp; The way Mr. Rikuzou did.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“No.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Only this time, I denied it definitively.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“No.&nbsp; Because I saw what happened to my father and my mother.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Once, my father had &#8211;</p>



<p>&nbsp;He had refused to marry the woman selected by his parents, and left the Minazuki family in order to tie himself to the woman with whom he had fallen in love.</p>



<p>&nbsp;He had made enemies of everyone around him, stood his ground for the sake of love, and succeeded at making a marriage of passion.</p>



<p>&nbsp;However, my father and my mother had gotten divorced.&nbsp; My mother had been unable to love me, and my father had been unable to conquer the special disease of his family.&nbsp; In short, they had not been able to lead a happy life.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If they had not been able to live happily, if they had not even been able to love their children, if their family had also fallen apart, did that marriage have any meaning?</p>



<p>&nbsp;Therefore, from the start, I had not sought a love match of blazing passion.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I didn’t have the tiniest bit of desire for that.&nbsp; I loathed it, even.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Still, being alone was scary.&nbsp; I wanted family.&nbsp; I wanted a place where I belonged and could sleep comfortably.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Still, somewhere in my heart&#8230;I wished for just one person in this world who would always be at my side, with whom I would share a quiet love.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“It’s all right for me to granted that engagement, right&#8230;?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;If I were granted it, doubtless I would no longer be able to turn back.</p>



<p>&nbsp;However, my answer was long since settled.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Even if he were not the fated partner whom I found myself and all that, even if he were the “betrothed” who had been prepared for me by others, I wanted to hang on to this person.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Of course.&nbsp; Thank you very much for accepting it.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Once more, Fumiya placed his hands on the tatami mat and bowed his head to me deeply.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;“I vow that I will continue to protect you for your entire life.&nbsp; From this day forward, until death do us part.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;Until death do us part.&nbsp; It seemed as if I both had and had not heard that before somewhere.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8211; Right after that, something happened.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“?!”</p>



<p>&nbsp;All of a sudden, an arrow-like object sailed through the open veranda.&nbsp; It cut between Fumiya and me, punched into the fusama sliding door, and roared into flames.</p>



<p>&nbsp;On all sides, the fusuma and shoji sliding doors slammed shut on their own, and crimson flames surrounded us.&nbsp; It was hot&#8230;.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Rikka, let us flee.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Huh?&nbsp; Huh?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Calm even in this situation, Fumiya took my hand and made me stand up.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Then, from inside his kimono, he drew out a fan-like object and whipped it open one-handed.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“-Open,” he murmured, and gave a hard flap of the fan.</p>



<p>&nbsp;At once, the force of the flames abated, and the fusuma and shoji doors sprang open.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“That’s my Bon!&nbsp; If your command worked, Bon, it’s got to be a Moon Being~”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“This is not the time for you to praise me but to do your part too, Koutarou.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Bringing me along, Fumiya descended from the veranda.&nbsp; Then we crossed the garden and fled this place.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I was barefoot and unable to make heads or tails of the situation.&nbsp; When I looked back at the flames behind us, they seemed to heave exactly like living creatures.&nbsp; I gulped.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Fumiya, wha-what in the world are these&#8230;.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“To be honest, there is currently discord in House Minazuki over <em>inheritance issues</em>.&nbsp; Many relatives seek my life.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“What?!”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Wa-wait a second.&nbsp; I hadn’t heard that before&#8230;!</p>



<p>&nbsp;Although I was becoming aware of the dangers of House Minazuki, I’d already consented to the engagement with Fumiya.&nbsp; Pulled by the hand, I was running down a path of no return.</p>



<p><em>&nbsp;Hey, Dad.&nbsp; Is it really all right for me to follow this person?</em></p>



<p><em>&nbsp;If it is, then why did you say that to me</em> that time&#8230;?</p>



<p>&nbsp;“By the way, Rikka.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;It caught me by surprise.&nbsp; In the middle of making our escape, Fumiya called to me and turned back.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Perhaps you have no intention of it, but I believe that even in this marriage that we’re bound to by the destiny of blood, we can still find love.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“What&#8230;?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Happy sixteenth birthday.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;The boy said it with no change in expression, at a time like this, in this way.</p>



<p>From running with this boy pulling my hand, I realized that my future had been redrawn and was taking a direction that I could not anticipate.</p>



<p>I had hope.&nbsp; Beyond that point, from the bottom of my heart, I was waiting for what I wished for.</p>



<p>“Again with your frontal assault, Bon.&nbsp; This guy might look sleepy, but he’s pretty energetic.&nbsp; Don’t drag Rikka along, please.”</p>



<p>“Koutarou, be quiet.”</p>



<p>However, my chest ached.</p>



<p>In the fresh scent of the night wind, when I looked up, the moon that drifted in the sky was terrifyingly beautiful.</p>



<p>Too beautiful.&nbsp; Painful emotions welled up, and I wanted to cry yet could not.</p>



<p>The sixth of June.</p>



<p>On this day, sixteen years ago, I was born into this world.</p>



<p>I was born of a man and a woman who loved each other, in order to be loved.</p>



<p>And yet&#8230;.&nbsp; <em>Hey, Dad.</em></p>



<p><em>If that were the case, then why did you say that, that time?</em></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“In the end, you are a daughter of the Minazuki.&nbsp; You should not have been born&#8230;.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Those were my father’s last words.</p>



<p>While he was preparing a betrothed named Fumiya for me, the “answer” that my father had come to, at the very end, was this.</p>



<p>At that moment, in the inside of my ears, there had been the snap of a “seed” splitting open&#8230;.</p>



<p>I had known perfectly well that something had sprouted.</p>



<p><em>Hey, Dad.&nbsp; If that were the case&#8230;.</em></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“For what reason, for whose sake was I born?”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p><em>I want to know.</em></p>



<p><em>I want to know the meaning of my birth.</em></p>



<p><em>If it didn’t mean a shred to either Mom or Dad.</em></p>



<p><em>I think I will try to choose the exact opposite path from them and search for that answer.</em><em></em></p>
