<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 5: The Voice of Paper</h2>



<p>Before a mirror set on my desk, I was cutting my bangs, which had grown down to my eyes.</p>



<p>I was already clad in my new uniform.</p>



<p>Through the room’s wood-framed window, I could see the fresh green of Mount Arashi.</p>



<p>Through the wide-open lattice window, I breathed in the clean air of Mount Arashi.</p>



<p>“&#8230;All done.”</p>



<p>Starting today, I would transfer to a new high school.</p>



<p>I closed the window of the room and checked my hairstyle and figure one last time in the full-length mirror.</p>



<p>Unlike the sailor suit of my previous school, my new school’s uniform was a blazer.&nbsp; The summer uniform was refreshing, with a white, short-sleeved blouse, a glossy ultramarine ribbon, and a navy blue skirt.&nbsp; When I tried putting it on, its beautiful appearance gave the impression of private-school-like quality.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, I’m ready now!”</p>



<span id="more-117"></span>



<p>Fumiya and You were waiting by the front entrance already, the two of them in their uniforms also.</p>



<p>Although I’d seen You wearing his uniform in a casual style, it was the first time for Fumiya.</p>



<p>Since he usually wore Japanese-style clothing, his high school uniform look was very novel.&nbsp; Without realizing it, I admired the way he wore it precisely right, the exact opposite from You.</p>



<p>Refreshing, or was his style excellent and enviable?</p>



<p>The uniform’s white shirt and necktie really suited him&#8230;.</p>



<p>For their part, Fumiya and You too were gawking at me for some reason.</p>



<p>By some chance, did I have something weird somewhere?!</p>



<p>“Rikka, did you cut your bangs?” asked Fumiya.</p>



<p>“Ah, yes!&nbsp; They kept growing, so I cut them myself&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I got embarrassed that Fumiya had noticed and, looking down, lightly stroked my bangs.</p>



<p>“It’s great!&nbsp; That way is definitely great!&nbsp; It suits you!”</p>



<p>With no hesitation at all, You praised me enthusiastically.</p>



<p>“Tha–thank you very much.&nbsp; &#8230;You, you look like you’re popular at school.”</p>



<p>“Me?&nbsp; Well, as for that, fairly.&nbsp; But unfortunately, my popularity gets split with Big Bro~, because our personalities are different.”</p>



<p>You was endlessly cheerful, natural, easy to talk to, and kind.</p>



<p>It was all an act, right?&nbsp; Because he was always smiling.</p>



<p>“Speaking of that, Big Bro, say something too.&nbsp; She’s your betrothed, isn’t she~?&nbsp; How’re you going to launch your usual frontal assault?”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>You waved at his older brother Fumiya.</p>



<p>Fumiya was staring at me openmouthed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I–it’s okay!&nbsp; I just cut my bangs, so&#8230;, that – it doesn’t matter.”</p>



<p>I waved my hands in front of my face and stopped him.</p>



<p>Because any more than that and I’d be too embarrassed, and because there might be something weird since I’d cut my bangs myself.</p>



<p>Next time, I’d go to a hair salon.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>At the Keifuku Electric Railroad’s Arashiyama Station, we boarded the “Randen” train that I would get to know, and we got off at the Shijo-Omiya Station, which was the closest to the high school.</p>



<p>A five-minute walk from here was the school I’d attend, the Rakuyou Gakuen High School.</p>



<p>“You okay?&nbsp; Rikka, you’re shaking a bit.”</p>



<p>In front of the school gate, You peered at my stiff face.</p>



<p>“I–I’m all right.&nbsp; Just nervous.”</p>



<p>Even though I had transferred schools before, I probably hadn’t gotten used to this nervousness.</p>



<p>“&#8230;You. Don’t stress Rikka out.”</p>



<p>“Yep yep.&nbsp; Big Bro’s bride is my sister-in-law, so I’m now very perfectly, skillfully, checking on her,” You declared, brimming with self-confidence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having cheerful You in the same class would be a lifesaver.</p>



<p>“Rikka.&nbsp; Is there a club activity you would like to join?” Fumiya asked me all of a sudden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After considering it for a moment, I shook my head.</p>



<p>“&#8230;No.&nbsp; I always went straight home, so at the moment, there is nothing.”</p>



<p>“In that case, how about going home with me after school?&nbsp; I have an hour-long Student Council meeting, but how about waiting in the library during that time?”</p>



<p>“All right.&nbsp; &#8230;Wait!&nbsp; Fumiya, are you on the Student Council?”</p>



<p>One beat late, I got surprised.&nbsp; Because it was the first I’d heard of it.</p>



<p>“Looking like this, it’s shocking that Big Bro is the school’s Vice President~.&nbsp; Not the President, but the Vice President – it’s just like Big Bro.”</p>



<p>You laughed.&nbsp; Fumiya shot him a mild, sidelong glare.</p>



<p>“I was appointed by the previous President, so I merely accepted it.&nbsp; Because it was someone who often took care of me.&nbsp; Besides, if I’m on our school’s Student Council, I can obtain various types of information that I want.&nbsp; It’s convenient.”</p>



<p>In their conversation, there were parts that I thought I understood, but in the end, there was still a lot that I didn’t get.</p>



<p>“Well, Rikka.&nbsp; This is me.”</p>



<p>“All right.”</p>



<p>When we entered the school building, I parted ways with Fumiya, who was in a different grade, partway down the hall.</p>



<p>However, I’d been sensing excessively avid stares for a little while now.&nbsp; It must have been because I was a transfer student, right&#8230;?</p>



<p>“Look.&nbsp; It’s the Minazuki brothers.&nbsp; They’re totally hot today too.”</p>



<p>“I’m on Team You~”</p>



<p>“No way, I’m definitely on Team Vice President.”</p>



<p>No, everyone wasn’t looking at me but at the brothers, Fumiya and You.</p>



<p>Of course they were, I thought, but after all, they were shockingly popular.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“I am Rikka Minazuki.&nbsp; It’s nice to meet you.”</p>



<p>Feeling nervous, I greeted my new class.&nbsp; As expected, there was a general stir at the Minazuki last name, but I sighed with relief that my seat was by the window in the very back next to You.</p>



<p>However, the minute recess started, my seat was completely surrounded by female classmates.</p>



<p>“Hey, hey, Miss Minazuki, are you related to You?”</p>



<p>“Then, then, are you related to our third-year mentor Fumiya Minazuki too?”</p>



<p>Without realizing it, I replied with a polite, “Yes, Miss,” and nodded.&nbsp; Lately, I’d been using polite language all the time.</p>



<p>However, I realized something.&nbsp; At school, was Fumiya my mentor?&nbsp; It had a somewhat novel ring to it.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Um.&nbsp; In the end, are Fumiya and You well known?”</p>



<p>“Very much so!&nbsp; Aren’t they so <em>good-looking</em>!”</p>



<p>One of the girls whacked my desk and made a passionate speech.</p>



<p>About how the Minazuki brothers were national-treasure-level hot guys who had descended upon our school, and all that.</p>



<p>As if to continue that, appraisals of the Minazuki brothers began to reach my ears from all sides.</p>



<p>“Vice President Fumiya Minazuki has such a handsome face, and he carries himself in a classical way that’s so full of dignity that I can’t bear it!&nbsp; It feels just like he’s the son of a good family.”</p>



<p>“And his grades are always at the top of his class!”</p>



<p>“He almost never wears a smile on that beautiful face, but you can call him the cool, proper type&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“The legitimate type, indeed.&nbsp; The legitimate-type handsome boy that Japan praises.”</p>



<p>Yeah, yeah~, nodded the girls intensely.</p>



<p>“His little brother You is the exact opposite, but that’s why he’s the best.”</p>



<p>“So, you like good-for-nothings, huh – “</p>



<p>“He’s nice to everyone without discrimination~, he’s easy to talk to~, plus he’s tall~”</p>



<p>“He’s friendly and he has a cute smile.&nbsp; But he gets top grades and is unrivaled in reflexes.”</p>



<p>“Yeah!&nbsp; He looks frivolous, but he’s serious, so you might say there’s a discrepancy?&nbsp; And then the Fine Arts Club, too – isn’t that an even bigger discrepancy – ?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;What?&nbsp; Fine Arts Club?”</p>



<p>From among the words that seemed to rain down on me, I obtained new information.</p>



<p>Even though I had known that You participated in club activities, he was in the Fine Arts Club?!&nbsp; Certainly there was a discrepancy with You’s image.&nbsp; I’d thought that it had to be a sports club.</p>



<p>“Hey, hey, whatcha saying about me~?”</p>



<p>In the middle, You cut into the conversation with a smile.&nbsp; The girls cried out in excitement and rose.</p>



<p>Certainly, You was a friendly person.&nbsp; The first time he met me, too, he’d acted this way from the start.</p>



<p>While Fumiya was surrounded by a cold, silent aura, You’s flamboyant, lively smile had dazzled me.</p>



<p>Perhaps I should call them a cool color and a warm color.&nbsp; They were brothers, so their facial features had similarities, but their expressions and the atmosphere around them were complete opposites.</p>



<p>Yes, as You had said, they were different.</p>



<p>Perhaps that was exactly what was reflected in their irresistible charm for the girls.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Although it seemed that I was going to be surrounded by girls and attacked with questions at lunch too, “Sorry, I’ll be taking my transfer-student relative Rikka with me.”</p>



<p>With the girls’ chorus of “Uh–” behind me, carrying my bento, I got swept along by You.</p>



<p>When You walked down the hall, guys and girls alike spoke to him.&nbsp; I was hiding behind his back.</p>



<p>Even if I hadn’t done that, I would have drawn attention just from being a relative of the Minazuki brothers.</p>



<p>“Um, You.&nbsp; Where are we going right now?”</p>



<p>“Hmm–?&nbsp; You could call it my sphere of influence, the art room.&nbsp; Cuz I’m in the Fine Arts Club.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I just heard that from the girls in our class.&nbsp; It surprised me a bit.”</p>



<p>“I’ve loved drawing and all that since I was little–.&nbsp; The Fine Arts Club here is pretty high level, and I can prepare countermeasures to deal with the art school entrance exam.&nbsp; And then, well, I come to school on the weekends and all, too, to sketch or color and all that.”</p>



<p>“Is your goal to attend art school?”</p>



<p>I was a little startled.&nbsp; That he was that serious about it.</p>



<p>“Yep yep.&nbsp; It’s tough – the art school entrance exam.&nbsp; I’ve got to have a plan starting from now.”</p>



<p>&#8230;Amazing.&nbsp; Even though he was still a high school first-year student, he had fixed his gaze on the future and, moreover, was even planning for the entrance exam already.&nbsp; He looked frivolous, but he was really serious.</p>



<p>Chatting about this and that, we reached You’s so-called sphere of influence, the art room.</p>



<p>The art room was filled with a strange smell.&nbsp; I wondered if it were the smell of paint.&nbsp; Easels were set up all around a counter on which plaster statues, and apples and vases, and so on, for still lifes were heaped.&nbsp; Really skillful, three-dimensional black-and-white pictures had been drawn on white paper, but which one was You’s&#8230;?</p>



<p>You opened a window, opened a refrigerator in the prep room with one hand, and took out green tea and orange juice.&nbsp; I understood.&nbsp; He was used to this room.</p>



<p>We sat down at a big table in the art room across from each other and opened our bento boxes.</p>



<p>Since I’d made the bento, they were simple ones with grilled salmon as the main dish.</p>



<p>“Wow, it looks so good.&nbsp; I love grilled fish!&nbsp; It’s a bento made just for me!”</p>



<p>&nbsp;I was glad that You was happy.&nbsp; On the bed of rice, I’d spread perilla and thumped down grilled salmon on top of it, so it looked lively too.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The other side dishes were stir-fried Fushimi peppers with okaka seasoning, rolled omelets with mayonnaise, Japanese fishcake with cheese and perilla in it, enoki mushrooms rolled in bacon.&nbsp; Filling in the box around them were boiled broccoli, and cherry tomatoes too.</p>



<p>“By the way, Rikka, you said that you’re not joining any club activities, but isn’t there anything you want to do, or like to do?”</p>



<p>“Hmm?&nbsp; Things I want to do, and things I like to do&#8230;?”</p>



<p>At my previous school, I’d gone home after class.</p>



<p>All of the housework was my job, so I had to clean and do the laundry, go grocery shopping and prepare dinner as soon as I got home.&nbsp; Anyway, after my father became sick, we were frantically going to doctor’s appointments.</p>



<p>“It’s sad&#8230;.&nbsp; When I really think about it, there’s nothing.”</p>



<p>“Haha, I see.”</p>



<p>Somehow, I’d given up easily.&nbsp; Fumiya grew various kinds of plants at the Minazuki home, and he was the Student Council Vice President at school.&nbsp; As for You, he was tackling and aiming for the future with enthusiasm in the Fine Arts Club,</p>



<p>At this point in time, I didn’t have a single specialty or hobby to speak of.</p>



<p>“But, your bento is amaaazingly good.&nbsp; Each dish has a lot of care put into it, so – how do I put it – I can tell that you’re used to cooking.&nbsp; Yesterday’s curry was also ridiculously good~”</p>



<p>“Oh, curry was Dad’s favorite dish, so I studied a lot of ways to make it and cooked various kinds.&nbsp; When you make curry with spices, you can use less oil and it’s healthy.”</p>



<p>“Whoa, no way!&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; You can make curry starting from the spices?&nbsp; That is really unexpected.”</p>



<p>You was pretty shocked.</p>



<p>“But, that’s your true specialty.&nbsp; Each and every day, you worked hard to do the housework and cooking for your father’s sake.&nbsp; It’s amazing, Rikka.&nbsp; I couldn’t do it.”</p>



<p>As if he’d accepted something, You nodded and praised me cheerfully.</p>



<p>I felt self-conscious, but that was probably because he’d said that doing just this counted as hard work.</p>



<p>“But, after all, I feel a bit of a gap between me, and you and Fumiya.&nbsp; The two of you know exactly what you should do, and what you want to do.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Well.&nbsp; That I can do as I wish is all thanks to Big Bro.”</p>



<p>You muttered just a few words.&nbsp; With an expression that was different from the cheerful one up until now, that held a hint of something.</p>



<p>What did he mean&#8230;?</p>



<p>“Hey.&nbsp; Rikka, why’d you accept the betrothal to Big Bro&#8230;?” You asked all of a sudden.</p>

<p>He stared at me, and of course I went stiff for a moment.</p>



<p>Because I’d been asked something similar by Umi too the other day&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Sorry, that came out of nowhere.&nbsp; But I was wondering how in the world a girl will get engaged to a guy she had nothing to do with up until then.”</p>



<p>Knitting his brows, You smiled.&nbsp; It seemed like he was worried about me.</p>



<p>I blinked several times and asked myself that honestly.</p>



<p>“That&#8230;is true.&nbsp; I – at the time, I had neither a place to go, nor a will to live&#8230;but Fumiya saved my life, so&#8230;.”</p>



<p>If you were to die, it would trouble <em>me</em> –</p>



<p>To be very honest, that voice, those words had struck a chord within me.</p>



<p>Even though I had known nothing whatsoever about Fumiya, my ears had judged that I could believe what he said.</p>



<p>And then, as if to cling to the hand that had been extended, I had accepted the betrothal.</p>



<span id="more-121"></span>



<p>Now I had a strong sense that by becoming his betrothed, I’d gotten a body to leech off, and that Fumiya acted somewhat like my guardian.&nbsp; Rather, I thought that he should think so.</p>



<p>“I see.&nbsp; I thought that it was a bit cruel to drag a girl who’d been raised on the outside into a Minazuki marriage of duty.”</p>



<p>“Ma–marriage of duty&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“But, it depends on the person.&nbsp; Because this marriage will save people&#8230;.”</p>



<p>After You muttered those few words, he brought his face close to mine without hesitation.</p>



<p>“So, what do you think of Big Bro?&nbsp; See, he’s got all sorts of things, a face that’s to your liking and a personality that’s compatible, financial stability and future prospects, doesn’t he!&nbsp; Marriage requirements, for girls.”</p>



<p>“U–um&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I was in a completely awkward position.&nbsp; If that were the case, then Fumiya was an amazing person who was at such a high level that I truly could not even get involved with him.</p>



<p>“Fu–Fumiya is a really amazing person, I think.&nbsp; At first, I thought that&#8230;someone who had to marry me was pitiable.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“I’m such a poor match for him.&nbsp; In terms of his maturity, his gentlemanliness, the words he speaks to me, and the way he holds himself, I can’t believe he’s only a high school student.&nbsp; &#8230;I’d say that he comes from a really good family?”</p>



<p>It didn’t feel quite right to say that he’d had a good upbringing.</p>



<p>Perhaps that aura of thoroughness came from his being the Head of House Minazuki?</p>



<p>“Only&#8230;I don’t know what I should say.&nbsp; I wonder if Fumiya is bracing himself for something all the time.”</p>



<p>For example, for House Minazuki’s customs.</p>



<p>And for the Minazuki <em>marriage of duty</em>, as You had just said.</p>



<p>As if he had no emotions of his own and were merely fulfilling his duties as the Head, he had an air of tension to an indescribable degree.</p>



<p>Most likely, to Fumiya, marrying me was also a duty he should carry out as the Head, right&#8230;?</p>



<p>At the words that I spoke in confusion, You’s eyes opened wider and wider.</p>



<p>Then, in a small voice, he said, “That is true.&nbsp; Big Bro has many enemies, also many things that he should do, things that he must protect.&nbsp; With Umi and me like this&#8230;you could say that there’s no one he can trust, even?”</p>



<p>As he spoke, You raised his head and gazed out the window of the art room.</p>



<p>At the blue sky.&nbsp; The white clouds.&nbsp; The free birds that flew leisurely.</p>



<p>“Since we were very young, Big Bro was educated thoroughly by that demon Gramps in order to become the Head of House Minazuki.&nbsp; That is, I thought it was already exhausting.&nbsp; To an extent that you can’t see, there were many kinds of intense training and discipline.&nbsp; It was&#8230;abuse.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“In the first place, Big Bro and I aren’t direct descendants of the main family, right?&nbsp; So there are many things we can’t do.&nbsp; The divine powers of the celestial maiden.&nbsp; Things using the power of the blood.&nbsp; There are many kinds of powers and rights that only the eldest child of the main family can carry on, and many things that Big Bro must have, as the Head of the main family, that he does not.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Oh, um.&nbsp; What are the powers and rights that only the eldest child of the main family can carry on?”</p>



<p>Although that had come up when talking to Fumiya before too, I didn’t know the details.</p>



<p>“Hmm–.&nbsp; Okay, there’s a door that only the eldest child of the main family can open, relics of the Moon that they can make&#8230;that’s the impression I get?&nbsp; In particular, a girl who is the eldest child of the main family is said to be the `closest to the celestial maiden,’ and she is born bearing potent blood of the celestial maiden.&nbsp; I think that your telekinesis must be stronger than ours by far, Rikka.”</p>



<p>“What?!&nbsp; Bu–but I can’t use it at all&#8230;, I – am I really the eldest child of the main family?”</p>



<p>“Ahaha.&nbsp; Don’t worry, don’t worry.&nbsp; It’ll definitely awaken~”</p>



<p>A–awaken&#8230;.</p>



<p>When I turned pale, You gave a carefree laugh.</p>



<p>However, his smiling face had already changed to something of worry.</p>



<p>“Before&#8230;everyone said it.&nbsp; We Minazuki have inherited the blood of the celestial maiden that is rare in all the world.&nbsp; As a result, we must be <em>pedigreed</em>.”</p>



<p>“Pedigreed&#8230;?”</p>



<p>I had a feeling that it wasn’t a term you used for humans, and with a crack, my chest grew cold.</p>



<p>“For this reason, many in the cadet branches are against Big Bro, who is not the eldest child of the main family, becoming the Head.&nbsp; Because he holds neither those powers nor rights.&nbsp; &#8230;Even that demon Gramps, when he was about to die, looked down on Big Bro as a failure.”</p>



<p>Fumiya, whom I thought was perfect, a failure&#8230;?</p>



<p>However, I got it.&nbsp; I had the feeling that I understood, just a little, what lay behind the anxiety and something like reckless, fast-living impatience that I sensed from Fumiya at times.</p>



<p>That was a “distortion” that had arisen because my father, Rikuzou Minazuki, had left the main family.</p>



<p>Because my father had left the main family, Fumiya and You’s father, who was not originally a member of the main family, was adopted into it, and so Fumiya had succeeded to it.&nbsp; Even though he did not have those rights and powers, <em>he had had to succeed to it</em>.</p>



<p>The result of my father and my mother’s elopement was that everything had gotten pushed onto them.</p>



<p>Without knowing anything about those matters, I had grown up in the outside world.</p>



<p>It wouldn’t have been strange if they had resented my presence, but Fumiya and You and Umi were all kind to me.</p>



<p>“&#8230;There’s – something – that I can do, right?”</p>



<p>I was struggling to hold my chopsticks.&nbsp; You glanced at me, gulped down his tea, and then heaved a sigh.&nbsp; He spoke in a gentle voice.</p>



<p>“That is to be yourself and always stay by Big Bro’s side.”</p>



<p>And he gave a heartbreaking smile.</p>



<p>“Big Bro is someone who doesn’t show any weaknesses.&nbsp; He thinks that if he shows weakness, it will be the end of the world.&nbsp; That’s how nervous he is about life.&nbsp; &#8230;Big Bro probably needs someone like you.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>He was nervous about life.&nbsp; Those words really struck a chord within me.</p>



<p>There were many circumstances about Fumiya the Head and about House Minazuki that we could not discuss with our classmates, and that they would not be able to understand.&nbsp; That was probably why You had brought me here.&nbsp; In order to have this conversation with me.</p>



<p>“That.&nbsp; You – you truly love Fumiya.”</p>



<p>“Huh?&nbsp; Ohh, well.&nbsp; I have an extreme brother complex.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“She says all sorts of things, but Umi is like that too.&nbsp; We rely on Big Bro.&nbsp; Big Bro told us.&nbsp; He said, you should feel free to do what you enjoy.&nbsp; &#8230;I owe Big Bro a debt that I cannot repay.”</p>



<p>Even though they were brothers, he owed such a debt that he could not repay it.&nbsp; What in the world could it be?</p>



<p>On the surface, You was extremely cheerful, but I got the feeling that he, too, bore the faint darkness that coiled around House Minazuki.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>After school that day, I was in the library.&nbsp; Fumiya was planning to come pick me up in an hour.</p>



<p>“I wonder what I should make for dinner tonight.”</p>



<p>It was a rare opportunity to read recipe books and such about Kyoto-style obanzai home cooking.</p>



<p>Up until now, I’d prioritized making my father’s favorite foods, but from now on, I’d be serving my cooking everyone in House Minazuki.</p>



<p>Speaking of that, what did Fumiya like?&nbsp; I wondered if there were foods he disliked.</p>



<p>I wondered if he had eaten today’s bento&#8230;.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p><em>Must kill&#8230;must kill&#8230;.</em></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>With a shudder, I went cold.&nbsp; I raised my head and scanned my surroundings.</p>



<p>From somewhere, I could hear a strange, whispering voice.</p>



<p>However, there were only students who were reading books here in the library.&nbsp; I couldn’t see the owner of the voice.</p>



<p>Not one of the students seemed to have heard the unnatural voice.</p>



<p>“The voice just now&#8230;it definitely wasn’t human.”</p>



<p>At the sudden occurence, I was at a loss, but that was all I knew.</p>



<p>I went out of the library and searched for the source of the voice while cupping my ears.&nbsp; The voice had definitely been saying “kill,” so it might be a harbinger of something terrible happening at this school.</p>



<p>All of a sudden, I wondered if Fumiya were in danger.</p>



<p>You had said so.&nbsp; That Fumiya had many enemies&#8230;.</p>



<p>Halfway down the hall, I heard the voice again.&nbsp; In a monotone, the voice whispered, “Must kill.”</p>



<p>“Oh.”</p>



<p>I saw the owner of the voice too.&nbsp; It was some sort of white “bird” flying in the sky.</p>



<p>Rather, that wasn’t a white bird.&nbsp; It looked like a scrap of paper cutting across the sky.</p>



<p>“Huh, what&#8230;?”</p>



<p>Completely focused on that paper bird, I chased it.&nbsp; The bird moved as if it were searching for a target.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On a landing down a flight of stairs, it found that target.</p>



<p>It was Fumiya.&nbsp; Fumiya was there&#8230;!</p>



<p>Wearing a Student Council armband, with a gentle expression, he was talking to a female student who was wearing the same Student Council armband.&nbsp; They seemed extremely close.</p>



<p>“Oh&#8230;.”</p>



<p>While I was taken aback, the paper bird stuck to Fumiya’s cheek.</p>



<p>Moreover, Fumiya didn’t notice it.</p>



<p>“Fumiya!&nbsp; Look out&#8230;!”</p>



<p>With a bad feeling, in a trance, I pelted down the stairs.&nbsp; Then, before I could think about what I was doing, I slapped his cheek as hard as I could with the palm of my hand.</p>



<p>Smack!</p>



<p>It made a loud sound, and Fumiya stumbled a little from the force.</p>



<p>At the same time, that paper bird peeled off and fell off his cheek.&nbsp; As it fluttered down, it straightened out with a ping before it hit the floor, crept along it as if it were sliding, and fled.</p>



<p>As for Fumiya, he was completely shocked that I had hit him out of nowhere.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Rikka&#8230;?”</p>



<p>I gasped.&nbsp; At last, I realized what I had done.</p>



<p>“Aaaaah, I’m sorry, I’m sorry!”</p>



<p>I yanked back and pressed my back to the wall of the landing.</p>



<p>Somehow, it felt as if everything were all over.</p>



<p>Because I’d shocked even myself by slapping him with all my strength.&nbsp; It was a serious slap.</p>



<p>I’d struck the person who’d saved my life, to whom I owed so much, with the palm of my hand, an act that I couldn’t do anything about, even if he hated me.</p>



<p>“I beg your pardon I beg your pardon I beg your pardon, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>My eyes were rolling in their sockets, I was clutching my right hand, which was still hot from the slap, to my chest, and I apologized over and over.</p>



<p>Fumiya walked right up to me, and thinking something, checked the palm of the hand that grasped my right hand.&nbsp; For some reason, the palm was stained black, as if I’d touched ink.</p>



<p>Seeing that, his eyes slowly widened.</p>



<p>“I’m surprised&#8230;.&nbsp; You noticed a paper image curse that even I didn’t notice, and peeled it off in one try.”</p>



<p>“Paper– ?&nbsp; Paper image curse?”</p>



<p>I had no idea what he meant.&nbsp; It was just that when I saw Fumiya’s red, swollen cheek, I remembered what I’d done once more, and I turned white.</p>



<p>“Haha, ahahaha!”</p>



<p>The female student from the Student Council who’d been speaking with Fumiya just now burst out laughing.</p>



<p>“I think one of your fans has mistaken our relationship again, Minazuki.”</p>



<p>“Ahh, I’m sorry, President.”</p>



<p>As Fumiya apologized to the girl, he gestured at me.</p>



<p>“This is Rikka Minazuki, a first-year student.&nbsp; She is my betrothed.”</p>



<p>He introduced me openly.&nbsp; I never dreamed that he would tell her about our betrothal without hesitation.</p>



<p>“I see, it’s been rumored for a while.&nbsp; The Minazuki Head’s fiancée has appeared at last.&nbsp; My family, too, has talked about nothing else for the past few days.”</p>



<p>“The information has reached you already&#8230;.&nbsp; I would expect no less from House Tsuchimikado.”</p>



<p>“Of course.&nbsp; Information about the Minazuki main family’s marriages is of great importance to the future of the world of exorcists too!”</p>



<p>The reaction of the female student from the Student Council was unexpectedly understanding.</p>



<p>As if she knew about House Minazuki.</p>



<p>“Rikka.&nbsp; This is our school’s Student Council President, Karen Tsuchimikado.”</p>



<p>“She–she’s the Student Council President?!”</p>



<p>While I was in shock, at some point the girl named Karen Tsuchimikado grasped my hand and pumped it up and down enthusiastically.</p>



<p>“Nice to meet you, Miss Betrothed.&nbsp; Minazuki and I are business associates, so don’t worry.&nbsp; And in the future, please favor House Tsuchimikado!”</p>



<p>She was an old-fashioned, vigorous person who spoke in a spirited way.&nbsp; She was a beauty, with her bobbed hair trimmed to her shoulders, her well-defined facial features, and her height, somewhat like a model.</p>



<p>There was an aura about her, or a tremendous sense of presence.</p>



<p>“Ni–nice to meet you.&nbsp; My name is Rikka Minazuki.”</p>



<p>While her pressure continued to press on me, I bobbed my head again and greeted her.</p>



<p>What did it mean that she was a business associate?&nbsp; I wondered&nbsp; if she were&#8230;one of the people on the side of humans who bought lunar resources, about whom Fumiya had talked previously.</p>



<p>Or, a person with some sort of cooperative relationship with House Minazuki, right?</p>



<p>“Leaving that aside, Rikka.&nbsp; Why did you notice that paper image?” Fumiya asked me with a slightly harsh, threatening attitude.</p>



<p>“A–a voice came from that paper bird.&nbsp; Must kill, must kill&#8230;it was saying, I think.&nbsp; And then, I thought it might be something dangerous, and when I chased it, the two of you&#8230;.”</p>



<p>When I answered, flustered, Fumiya and the Student Council President exchanged meaningful looks.</p>



<p>“Hmm.&nbsp; That thing that escaped was a paper image bearing the sign of the Moon.&nbsp; It’s something troublesome that not even exorcists recognize easily.&nbsp; Your lady betrothed was very perceptive.”</p>



<p>Clasping his hands behind his back, Fumiya replied indifferently to the Student Council President, who was describing the situation, “Perhaps it has to do with Rikka’s divine power.&nbsp; She has good ears.”</p>



<p>“You mean she can pick up the register of creatures of the Moon?&nbsp; That’s a big deal!&nbsp; Ahahahahahaha.”</p>



<p>The Student Council President roared with laughter.&nbsp; The register of creatures of the Moon?</p>



<p>“Karen.&nbsp; As that paper image bore the sign of the Moon, it may have been created by the Minazuki.&nbsp; I would like to return and investigate it.&nbsp; Would that be all right?”</p>



<p>“No problem.&nbsp; If you’re mixed up with creatures of the Moon, you’ll get to the bottom of its true identity quickly.&nbsp; I’ll go after that escaped paper image.&nbsp; See you later.”</p>



<p>With a smile in my direction, the Student Council President turned on her heel and went down from the landing.</p>



<p>At the bottom of the stairs, boys and girls wearing Student Council armbands were waiting quietly.&nbsp; They also looked at me nonchalantly.&nbsp; As he saw her off, Fumiya once again took my hand all of a sudden.</p>



<p>“Let’s go home, Rikka.”</p>



<p>“Oh, but Fumiya, I slapped you&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Except that Fumiya didn’t seem to be in a great hurry.</p>



<p>On our way home, he continued to wear a severe expression, rubbed his chin with his hand, and seemed to be deep in thought about something.&nbsp; It must have been smarting quite a bit, so that he couldn’t even speak.</p>



<p>I’d had a reason, but nonetheless, I’d done something for which he would hate me with good reason.&nbsp; I’d slapped him across the face as hard as I could.&nbsp; When you were hit like that, it hurt.</p>



<p>I knew that well.</p>

<p>When we got home, Fumiya told me, “Please wait a moment,” and went back to his room.</p>



<p>I, too, went to my own room and changed.</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p><em>Bong bong</em> came the sound of the antique clock, telling me that it was the evening.&nbsp; When I heard that sound, I remembered that a long time ago, when I was still very young, I’d had a similar experience.</p>



<p>My older twin sister was playing in the garden, and a certain yokai stretched out a hand towards her, trying to do something evil.</p>



<p>My sister couldn’t see it.</p>



<p>I had a bad feeling, cried, “Watch out!” and ran up to my sister.&nbsp; I thought that she was going to get eaten by that yokai.</p>



<p>However, that time, I knocked her down hard and she got hurt.&nbsp; When they noticed, the people around us in the garden lost their tempers, and the yokai also vanished.</p>



<p>My mother saw this and screamed, got angrier than I’d ever seen her before, and violently slapped me across the cheek.</p>



<span id="more-125"></span>



<p>That time – I couldn’t forget my mother’s scream and horror-filled face, the pain in my cheek.</p>



<p>Without even telling me that I’d been bad, my mother tortured me, as if I had tried to kill my older twin sister.</p>



<p>Even though I told her that it wasn’t true, I was trying to protect my sister, she couldn’t believe me.</p>



<p>When I said that there was an evil monster, it made her angrier and angrier that I was lying.</p>



<p>My mother could not understand my actions.</p>



<p>I, too, grew somewhat confused about what I’d done, and I got mixed up.</p>



<p>Only my father spoke up for me, as if he’d guessed something, but I felt that from then on, my mother was hard on me.</p>



<p>Before that point, I had already felt vaguely that her attitudes towards my sister and me were different, but&#8230;increasingly, my mother did not conceal her hatred of me.</p>



<p>Therefore, it was scary.&nbsp; To be caused painful thoughts and unpleasant experiences by someone, to be detested.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“Again, it’s unnatural&#8230;!&nbsp; Rikka’s existence is truly unnatural.&nbsp; This child isn’t normal.&nbsp; It’s not just me.&nbsp; No matter where she goes, Rikka is sure to be hated!”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>My mother’s words, spoken to my father through tears, like a curse.</p>



<p>That was the way in which I became aware of it.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“I apologize, I’ve kept you waiting.”</p>



<p>As I checked ingredients in the kitchen while waiting, Fumiya arrived, now wearing a hakama as he often did at home.</p>



<p>With one hand clenched around an ancient key, he said, “Please follow me.”</p>



<p>We left the residence, came out of the bamboo forest, and climbed the mountain behind the house.</p>



<p>Today, the sunset was extremely red.&nbsp; All possible insect sounds were ringing out in the bamboo forest.</p>



<p>Because Fumiya was walking a little fast, I matched my pace to his and sometimes ran.</p>



<p>“U-um.&nbsp; Fumiya, is there anything you would like to eat tonight?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Without answering in particular, Fumiya merely headed onward.&nbsp; After a few minutes, I asked another question.</p>



<p>“Um&#8230;where are we going?”</p>



<p>“We are going to the Minazuki storehouse.”</p>



<p>This time, there was an answer.</p>



<p>When we climbed a different path from the one leading to the Minazuki tomb, we came out on a stretch with a row of ancient, mortar-walled storehouses.</p>



<p>Fumiya unlocked one of them with the key and entered.&nbsp; I followed.</p>



<p>He switched on the lights.&nbsp; Inside the storehouse was a slightly raised wooden floor, and I could see rows of shelves extending all the way into the depths.&nbsp; It looked as if countless ancient scrolls were kept on those shelves.</p>



<p>We removed our shoes and stepped up onto the wooden floor.&nbsp; Fumiya checked several shelves and showed me something he was holding.</p>



<p>“Oh&#8230;.”</p>



<p>It was a piece of white paper, modeled after the human figure.</p>



<p>It had a rounded head and two arms with spread-out sleeves, and a lower body that tapered to a point.</p>



<p>“Was the paper bird that you saw at school something like this?”</p>



<p>“Ye–yes.&nbsp; It had this sort of shape.”</p>



<p>I thought that this would indeed look like a bird flying in the sky.</p>



<p>“This is a piece of paper modeled after the human figure, called a paper image.&nbsp; It is an object which a divine spirit is drawn to or occupied by; it acts as a substitute for disaster; it is used in animating objects to simulate a person.&nbsp; Among them, this Minazuki-made one with a pointed torso is called the ‘kakure paper image,’ or `hidden paper image.’&nbsp; It is often used as a `hex’ to curse other people.”</p>



<p>“A hex&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; When you want to cast a hex, you write down in detail how you will curse the target, chant the words, and command it.&nbsp; When you do that, the paper image heads to the target, sticks to their body, and hexes them as commanded.”</p>



<p>Fumiya brought the hidden paper image to his lips and softly chanted, “Fly.”</p>



<p>When he did so, the paper image began to circle over our heads on its own.&nbsp; Before long, it vanished quietly.</p>



<p>“I–it disappeared&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; Because it uses special paper, as its name suggests, the hidden paper image conceals itself easily.&nbsp; To the point that even skilled exorcists and magic users will overlook them.”</p>



<p>Ahh, was that why even Fumiya hadn’t noticed that paper image when it stuck to his cheek&#8230;?</p>



<p>“The paper used in this paper image, what in the world is it?”</p>



<p>“It is paper made from one of the Lunar World plants, a tree called the ‘kakure kami noki,’ or hidden paper noki.”</p>



<p>A Lunar World plant – the kakure kami noki.</p>



<p>That was one of the lunar resources that the celestial maiden had brought to Earth a thousand years ago.</p>



<p>Fumiya held his hand out towards the depths of the storehouse and beckoned with his fingers, as if drawing something to himself.&nbsp; When he did, an ancient scroll flew to him out of the depths of the storehouse.&nbsp; He was probably using telekinesis.</p>



<p>We sat down there and spread out the scroll.&nbsp; On it was a diagram explaining the kakure kami noki.</p>



<p>It looked like a white, crape-myrtle-like tree.</p>



<p>“This is the kakure kami noki.&nbsp; Even among the Things of the Moon that have a weak sign, I’d say that it’s particularly difficult to notice its existence?&nbsp; Some grow here on the premises too, but even I, who am descended from the blood of House Minazuki, can only see them hazily.”</p>



<p>Because they were hidden, could disappear, and were hard to notice, it was easy to curse a target.</p>



<p>He said that many magic users came to House Minazuki in order to buy these kakure kami noki paper images.</p>



<p>“However, my predecessor instituted a complete ban on selling these kakure paper images to outsiders.&nbsp; It is easy to use them for evil and to cause serious problems.”</p>



<p>“Then, why was it used this time?”</p>



<p>“There are ones left in circulation from long ago, and that was used?&nbsp; Or&#8230;someone in House Minazuki sent it to kill me?”</p>



<p>Fumiya’s gaze drifted to the side, and he spoke in a low voice.</p>



<p>“There is an extremely high probability that a cadet branch of House Minazuki is tangled up in this.&nbsp; If I had been cursed by that paper image, I wonder what would have become of me by now&#8230;?”</p>



<p>At the quiet anger in Fumiya’s voice, I shrank back, just a little.</p>



<p>“Anyway, Rikka.&nbsp; Thank you, truly, for this.&nbsp; You heard the `voice’ of the kakure paper image, perceived its existence, and saved me.&nbsp; You were brave to confront a mysterious thing.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>With a serious expression, I stiffened, unable to react at all.</p>



<p>“Rikka?”</p>



<p>“No–nothing.”</p>



<p>I blinked and looked down.</p>



<p>“I&#8230;I hit you hard, Fumiya.&nbsp; I, I’ve caused you a painful experience&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Steadily, uncontrollable tears seeped out.</p>



<p>Even though Fumiya was thanking me.</p>



<p>“I – don’t you hate me&#8230;?”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I said it out loud.&nbsp; Ashamed, I turned my face away even more.</p>



<p>Even though I understood from the bottom of my heart that Fumiya wasn’t the slightest bit angry, it was as if I had a persecution complex, and I was greatly disturbed.</p>



<p>Naturally, Fumiya was bewildered by my words.</p>



<p>“Hate you?&nbsp; What are you talking about?&nbsp; I’m grateful to you&#8230;.”</p>



<p>However, at that point, Fumiya covered his hand with his mouth and swallowed his words.</p>



<p>“I apologize.&nbsp; I have looked harsh this entire time.&nbsp; I was thinking, worrying, about whether someone from a cadet branch were tangled up in this incident.&nbsp; I was making a nervous face, lost in thought investigating the cause, and unfortunately I was tardy in thanking you&#8230;.&nbsp; It can’t be helped that this caused you to think I was angry at you.”</p>



<p>“Tha–that isn’t it!&nbsp; I was – I was just – just being cowardly.”</p>



<p>Truly, I was nothing but a weak coward.</p>



<p>“I was just being an idiot.”</p>



<p>Why was I acting like this?</p>



<p>Even though I wished only to move forward with my life, my heart was already getting dragged in a bad direction.&nbsp; Towards being hated.&nbsp; I remembered the fear.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“–Rikka’s existence is truly unnatural.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Even now, my mother’s voice, her words of rejection, continued to echo in my ears.</p>



<p>“Rikka.”</p>



<p>At Fumiya’s voice, I gasped and looked up.</p>



<p>Fumiya touched my hand, which was clenched on my knee, and peered into my face.</p>



<p>“Somehow or other, beyond that, please don’t disparage yourself.&nbsp; I feel only gratitude towards you.&nbsp; That you tried to save me makes me happy.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“I will not come to hate you.&nbsp; From now on, even if something happens, that alone is certain.”</p>



<p>Why was Fumiya declaring it like that?</p>



<p>Although we’d met only a little while ago, his eyes held unhesitating sincerity.</p>



<p>His words were unhesitating.</p>



<p>“Ah, right.&nbsp; This&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Then, looking like he’d just remembered, Fumiya took something out of the breast of his kimono.</p>



<p>A long, thin&#8230;cord?</p>



<p>“They are a set of plaited cords.&nbsp; I braided them from the silk threads we produce.&nbsp; They’re akin to a protective charm.&nbsp; If you would like, please take them.&nbsp; You can wear them as hair ornaments and use them to tie the obi on your everyday kimonos.”</p>



<p>The long, thin cords that he held out to me were a beautiful, glossy, light blue, and they reminded me of the first hydrangea blossom I’d received.&nbsp; However, the fragrance that wafted from the plaited cords was very refreshing, and bittersweet.</p>



<p>When I brought them closer to my face, the scent became even stronger, yet gentle.</p>



<p>“&#8230;They smell really – good.”</p>



<p>“I rubbed a little essential oil from sweet summer oranges on them.&nbsp; Earlier, you said that you liked it.”</p>



<p>Although it was something that I’d said in a casual conversation, Fumiya had remembered it.</p>



<p>I didn’t know why, but I gathered my hair on the sides and tried tying it with these plaited cords.</p>



<p>The fragrance of the sweet summer oranges that drifted to my nose from the sides of my face soothed my troubled heart.</p>



<p>Fumiya watched me, looking as if he were surprised.&nbsp; That expression was similar to the one he’d shown this morning, when I appeared after cutting my bangs.</p>



<p>“Rikka, that&#8230;this morning, I couldn’t say anything, but&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“Both your bangs and those hair ornaments – suit you well.&nbsp; I think&#8230;you’re cute.”</p>



<p>Fumiya spoke while averting his gaze and acting a little self-conscious.</p>



<p>Even though it wasn’t his usual confident manner of speaking, to me, this was also Fumiya’s frontal assault.&nbsp; It was too direct, and my chest tightened to the point that I seemed to stop breathing.</p>



<p>“Tha–thank you – very much.”</p>



<p>With my cheeks crimson, I gripped the ends of the plaited cords that tied back my hair.</p>



<p>“I – will treasure them.&nbsp; Always&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I was narrowing my eyes and smiling slightly, so my eyes were brimming with tears.</p>



<p>It wasn’t a forced smile, but one that came out naturally, I thought.</p>



<p>It seemed that I could both smile and cry at something that jolted my heart in this way.</p>



<p>Then, secretly, I swore an oath.</p>



<p>Not to be weak.&nbsp; Not merely to receive.</p>



<p>I wanted to become someone who could give something back to this person.</p>
