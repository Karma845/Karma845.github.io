<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 8: The People of the Cadet Branch (Part II)</h2>



<p>After the tense conversation ended, Chidori turned to me and encouraged me to try the Japanese confectioneries before me.</p>



<p>The confectioneries were white sweet-rice jelly cut into triangles, covered with cooked azuki beans.</p>



<p>“These are a traditional Kyoto confectionery called ‘minazuki.’&nbsp; Since you were raised in Tokyo, you may not have seen them before, my lady.”</p>



<p>“Huh, they are minazuki?”</p>



<p>I stared at them blankly.&nbsp; Because those confectioneries had the same name as we did.</p>



<p>“It’s a coincidence, but because these confectioneries have the same name as we do, we eat them every chance we get in June.”&nbsp; Next to me, Fumiya explained it to me.</p>



<p>Koutarou also approached the low table and ate the minazuki confectioneries with a carefree air.</p>



<p>Since he turned to me and openly appealed to me, “They’re delicious ~ they’re delicious ~,” I picked up the wooden chopsticks and had one too.</p>



<p>The white sweet-rice jelly was much, much more crisp than mochi, and at first the texture startled me.</p>



<span id="more-165"></span>



<p>With a refined taste that wasn’t too sweet, it set off the flavor of the azuki wonderfully.&nbsp; It was a simple, refreshing, summery confectionery.&nbsp; There was nothing better than eating dessert after feeling nervous.</p>



<p>Next to me, Fumiya cocked his head to a side and inquired about my reaction.&nbsp; “How is it?”</p>



<p>“It’s very good.&nbsp; Its appearance is a pretty triangle too, and it’s cool.”</p>



<p>“In Kyoto, these confectioneries were originally eaten on the thirtieth of June at shrines during the ‘Summer Purification Rites.’&nbsp; Sweet-rice jelly cut into triangles is likened to ice.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I also thought it looked like ice at first&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I wondered if it were because of the triangular shape.&nbsp; Or because the white sweet-rice jelly was translucent.</p>



<p>I was filled with excitement at learning about the flavors of Japanese confectioneries that had existed in Kyoto since ancient times and about their traditions.</p>



<p>Traditions lived on in the events held amidst the passage of seasons, and in the confectioneries and dishes eaten then, too.&nbsp; They would become a part of my life.</p>



<p>“By the way, you two.&nbsp; On this rare trip to Fushimi, how about visiting the nearby Fushimi Inari Shrine after this?&nbsp; The rain has stopped, and it’s sunny~”&nbsp; All of a sudden, Koutarou turned to Fumiya and me and suggested that.&nbsp; “Bon, too, I heard you rarely take Rikka out on dates~”</p>



<p>“There is some truth to that. &nbsp;My lord, if Lady Rikka dislikes you, all of this will come to naught.”&nbsp; Even Chidori sided with Koutarou, saying that with gleaming eyes.</p>



<p>“Tha–that’s.”</p>



<p>“How could I ever hate him&#8230;?”</p>



<p>Fumiya tried to say something, but I spoke at the same time, the words tumbling out.</p>



<p>How could I ever hate him?&nbsp; That would never happen.&nbsp; I tried to say that.</p>



<p>Fumiya, Chidori, and Koutarou were all shocked for some reason, so I grew ashamed and said in a tiny voice, “I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>“No, it’s fine,” Fumiya said. &nbsp;“Certainly I was thinking that I wanted to take you to Fushimi Inari Shrine.&nbsp; Since it’s stopped raining, would you like to go?”</p>



<p>“Ye–yes!&nbsp; I’d like to go.”</p>



<p>I’d been interested in Fushimi Inari Shrine for a long time now.&nbsp; I wanted to see the famous Senbon Torii, the thousands of torii gates.&nbsp; Just wearing a kimono and going out with Fumiya made my heart thump.</p>



<p>We left the Fushimi Minazuki’s residence at once and set out for Fushimi Inari Shrine.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Fushimi Inari Shrine – that was the head shrine of the Inari shrines where the god of the harvest was worshipped.</p>



<p>As Mount Inari was said to be the origin of the Inari faith, many people from all over the country made circuit pilgrimages and came to worship here.&nbsp; They said that it was beneficial to business prosperity and abundant grain harvests.&nbsp; Lately, there were also many foreign tourists and it was bustling, but right now, just after the rain stopped, there were few tourists.</p>



<p>“Also, many shops in this area serve kitsune udon noodles with fried tofu and Inari sushi tofu pockets,” Fumiya said.&nbsp; Kitsune fox spirits, Inari’s messengers, were supposed to love fried tofu.&nbsp; “Another local specialty is whole roasted sparrows.”</p>



<p>“Spa–sparrows?!”</p>



<p>Fumiya asked, “Shall we try them?” but my head swam with images of the cute sparrows that flitted about the main home’s garden and bamboo forest.&nbsp; I couldn’t work up the courage.</p>



<p>So–someday I’d try them.&nbsp; Someday&#8230;.</p>



<p>We passed under the large red torii gate in the front, walked up the white cobblestone path, and prayed to a pair of not stone guardian dogs, but stone guardian foxes, at the shrine’s gate.</p>



<p>Fushimi Inari Shrine’s guardian foxes held an ear of rice, a scroll, a piece of jade, and a key in their mouths, and they had dignified poses.</p>



<p>I sensed mysterious eyes on me, and Fumiya told me that the kitsune messengers here were very interested in the Minazuki and watched us.</p>



<p>All right.&nbsp; After we visited the main shrine, we climbed Mount Inari, passing under a long line of red-painted torii gates, and circling around the sites of former shrines and mounds for private worship.&nbsp; According to Fumiya, we had a long way to go.</p>



<p>“Wow&#8230;.”</p>



<p>The Senbon Torii were even more beautiful than I’d imagined.</p>



<p>At the beautiful contrast between the green of the trees and the red torii gates and, on top of that, the unique glitter of water droplets just after the rain, my heart beat fast.</p>



<p>The sunlight shone through the green leaves and passed through the openings of the red torii gates.</p>



<p>Immersed in that fantastical view and the fresh air, in the midst of that extraordinary scene, we lingered quietly, as if we had lost ourselves in another world.&nbsp; You might also say that we were overwhelmed.</p>



<p>“Rikka.&nbsp; It must be difficult to climb this mountain in those unfamiliar sandals, right?”</p>



<p>Whenever we came to an uneven place, Fumiya would worry about me and hold out a hand.</p>



<p>Even though it wasn’t the first time he’d touched me, my heart would thump oddly at the sight.</p>



<p>However, when I did take his hand, I’d breathe a sigh of relief.</p>



<p>“These sandals are light, and they’re very easy to walk in,” I said.&nbsp; “Before, when I wore wooden clogs, walking just a little would make my feet hurt so much I couldn’t stand it.&nbsp; By any chance, do the thongs on these sandals use Minazuki silk too?”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; That is correct.&nbsp; I always think this, but you’re very good at walking a lot.&nbsp; You have more stamina than I’d expect&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“That might be true.&nbsp; I’m pretty good at school marathons and hiking.”</p>



<p>Or rather, perhaps I enjoyed trotting forward.</p>



<p>Even though I wasn’t involved in sports in particular, my middle school was far from home, so every day I walked a fair distance.&nbsp; Plus I also went from one supermarket to another in search of cheap deals, perhaps.</p>



<p>Also, if I hadn’t had stamina, I couldn’t have kept going and nursing Father.</p>



<p>“Oh.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could this also be the Minazuki constitution?!&nbsp; Having more stamina than usual and all that.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;No.&nbsp; That is not the case.&nbsp; If it were Umi, she’d be throwing a tantrum and falling behind around here.”</p>



<p>Fumiya was like me too.&nbsp; Usually he did farm work and gardening, so he had considerable stamina.&nbsp; After all, you’d get quite a bit of exercise just from going up and down the stone steps at the Mount Arashi main home.</p>



<p>“Rikka, look up, please.”</p>



<p>Fumiya stopped walking and pointed overhead.&nbsp; In the openings of the red torii gates, long, skinny creatures were forming a throng and squirming along.</p>



<p>“Wha–what are those?”</p>



<p>They seemed like thin, golden sashes.&nbsp; When I looked very closely, they had fox’s heads, and cute front paws too.</p>



<p>“Those are tube foxes.&nbsp; They are fox spirits with long, skinny forms that live in bamboo stalks.&nbsp; &#8230;On this mountain is the Fushimi Kandakara Shrine, which is connected to the ‘Tale of the Bamboo Cutter.’&nbsp; It is surrounded by a bamboo forest, so it has become the home of the tube foxes.”</p>



<p>Those tube foxes were different from the divine messengers of Fushimi Inari Shrine.&nbsp; They seemed to be wild ayakashi.&nbsp; They threaded their way through the openings of the red torii gates and played as they pleased, their golden tails flashing.</p>



<p>As I followed the tube foxes with my gaze and sank into a dream-like state, Fumiya asked suddenly from next to me, “By the way&#8230;how familiar are you with the ‘Tale of the Bamboo Cutter’?”</p>



<p>His voice overlapped with the sound of the wind that rustled the trees on Mount Inari.</p>



<p>I looked up at the side of Fumiya’s face.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Um, that’s the famous story about Kaguya-hime, Princess Kaguya, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“Yes, that is correct.”</p>



<p>At his somewhat listless expression, at first I didn’t realize the purpose of that question, but then: “Oh!&nbsp; Speaking of that, Kaguya-hime from the ‘Tale of the Bamboo Cutter’ – came from the Moon.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I gasped as I realized that.&nbsp; Fumiya nodded slowly once more.</p>



<p>“The ‘Tale of the Bamboo Cutter’ is said to be Japan’s most ancient tale.&nbsp; For House Minazuki as well, it is a tale with a deep connection.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter –</p>



<p>Once upon a time, there was a man called Taketori no Okina, the old bamboo cutter.&nbsp; He discovered a shining stalk of bamboo on the mountain, and when he cut it down, a small, beautiful baby came out of the stalk.&nbsp; That child brought wealth to the old man and his wife, and as time passed, she grew up to become a beautiful maiden who shone brightly.</p>



<p>The maiden was named Nayotake no Kaguya-hime, the “Shining Princess of the Young Bamboo.”&nbsp; Those who had heard of her beauty came to the bamboo cutter’s home to see her.&nbsp; In response to the especially passionate “Five Nobles,” Kaguya-hime made a certain demand and announced that she would marry the one who achieved it.</p>



<p>Her demand was that each of them should bring her one of the five treasures that she desired.</p>



<p>The divine stone bowl of the Buddha.&nbsp; A jeweled branch from the Horai Immortal Island.&nbsp; A coat of fire rat skins.&nbsp; The pearl from a dragon’s throat.&nbsp; A cowry shell born from a swallow –</p>



<p>However, none of them were things of this world, and no one was able to find the treasures that Kaguya-hime desired.</p>



<p>Hearing this rumor, the emperor begged to catch one glimpse of Kaguya-hime and forced his way into her house.&nbsp; He saw her beautiful, shining figure.</p>



<p>However, when the emperor approached, Kaguya-hime vanished at once in the midst of a shining light.&nbsp; Understanding at last that she was not of this world, the emperor fell more and more deeply in love with Kaguya-hime and began to write letters to her.</p>



<p>Several years passed.</p>



<p>From a certain point on, Kaguya-hime had begun to gaze up at the Moon, lost in thought, and weep.</p>



<p>To the old man, who asked her why she wept, Kaguya-hime said that she was a resident of the Lunar City.</p>



<p>When she said that soon people would come from the Moon to pick her up, the old man shut Kaguya-hime up in their home, and the emperor stationed an army around the house to protect her.</p>



<p>However, the Lunar King and the Lunar residents appeared from the Moon, sailing on ships of clouds.&nbsp; Mysteriously, the attacks of the humans on Earth completely missed them.&nbsp; All of the closed doors of the home opened on their own, and Kaguya-hime, who’d been shut up in the innermost room, came outside.</p>



<p>To the old man, who was trying to keep her here, the Lunar King made an announcement.</p>



<p>The princess had been sent down to Earth because she had committed a crime, he said.</p>



<p>Kaguya-hime left a letter for the old man, and an “elixir of immortality” and a letter in which she had written a waka poem to the emperor.&nbsp; Wrapping herself in a “robe of feathers,” she forgot everything that had happened on Earth and she returned to the Moon&#8230;.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>That was the brief version of the tale that I remembered.</p>



<p>It was a very famous tale from ancient times that everyone in this country studied in classical literature classes.</p>



<p>“Although the author of the ‘Tale of the Bamboo Cutter’ is unknown, at the beginning of the Heian Period, our family examined whether it might have been a <em>tale written by a Lunar World person</em>.&nbsp; To House Minazuki, the ‘Tale of the Bamboo Cutter’ is a valuable story that solves many riddles surrounding the Lunar World and that provides evidence for many facts.&nbsp; &#8230;And there is still something concealed in this tale.”</p>



<p>Fumiya held a finger to his lips and spoke in a tone as if he were about to tell me a secret.</p>



<p>“For example – but – when Kaguya-hime looks up at the Moon and weeps&#8230;it’s said that this resembles the ‘Moon’s Return Disease’.”</p>



<p>“What&#8230;?!”</p>



<p>Apart from that, when the attacks of the people on Earth failed to hit the Lunar residents, and when the doors that shut in Kaguya-hime opened on their own, these scenes resembled the “Telekinesis” power.&nbsp; This was proof that Lunar World people could use Telekinesis.</p>



<p>In addition, the five treasures that Kaguya-hime demanded from the five nobles.&nbsp; These were all valuable Lunar World resources.&nbsp; It seemed that there was an opinion that they were ingredients for the “Elixir of Immortality” that appeared at the end of the tale.</p>



<p>And the “robe of the feathers” that Kaguya-hime donned at the end.</p>



<p>The important item from robe-of-feathers tales also appeared in this tale.&nbsp; It was proof that it was required to return to the Moon.</p>



<p>Certainly, at hearing so many circumstances surrounding House Minazuki’s celestial maiden and things that were connected to her, a shiver ran through me.&nbsp; I felt considerable unease, and without realizing it, I hugged myself.</p>



<p>It was as if how I saw the “Tale of the Bamboo Cutter,” which everyone knew, had changed completely.</p>



<p>“Incidentally, it is customary to call the eldest daughter of the main family of House Minazuki the Princess of the Shining Night, or ‘Kagayakuyo no Hime.’&nbsp; It is shortened to ‘Kaguya-hime.’&nbsp; In short, that is you, Rikka.”</p>



<p>“What – I am – Kaguya-hime?!”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; That is how important the ‘Tale of the Bamboo Cutter’ is to House Minazuki.&nbsp; Oh, it’s the same as calling Chidori the ‘Ori-hime’ of Fushimi.&nbsp; No need to get so excited.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Even though he told me that, I shrank back at being given such an important title.</p>



<p>Speaking of that, Chidori also seemed a little angry over being called the ‘Ori-hime’ of Fushimi&#8230;.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>All right.&nbsp; The further up we climbed, the more Mount Inari assumed a divine atmosphere.</p>



<p>There were ancient mounds and sites of former shrines, silent and mossy.</p>



<p>Small red torii gates led to a stone torii gate.&nbsp; It sparkled, entering my field of vision in a matter-of-fact way.</p>



<p>The sensation was mysterious.&nbsp; Even though it was a place I didn’t know, I felt nostalgic for it.&nbsp; It smelled that way.</p>



<p>Here was an atmosphere that befitted what you might call the precincts of a shrine.</p>



<p>That wasn’t all.&nbsp; Raven and fox ayakashi were here and there, acting natural, watching us quietly, which gave me a start.&nbsp; I might say that, for an instant, something chilly pierced my chest?</p>



<p>Those were creatures that regular tourists could not see, creatures that were not mortal.</p>



<p>They bore us no ill will by any means, but they didn’t bear us goodwill either in particular.&nbsp; They were creatures with neither the desire nor the motive to attack humans.</p>



<p>However, they were certainly deeply and unusually interested in Fumiya and me, and they stared steadily at us.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Huh?”</p>



<p>It happened at that moment.</p>



<p>From somewhere came a mysterious sound, and I stopped without thinking.</p>

<p><em>Rattle rattle&#8230;rattle rattle rattle&#8230;.</em></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Although it was a faint sound, it rang in my ears to an odd degree.</p>



<p>I felt as if I’d heard it before, sometime and somewhere, but I wondered what it could be.</p>



<p>I got a bad feeling and chills, and unthinkingly plucked at Fumiya’s haori.</p>



<p>“&#8230;?&nbsp; What is it, Rikka?”&nbsp; Fumiya stopped too, and turned to look at me.</p>



<p>“Something – I have a bad feeling&#8230;something’s going to happen.&nbsp; The sound&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“The sound?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that, I gasped.&nbsp; Something Fumiya could not hear, that I could.</p>



<p>Could it have been the sound of a Creature of the Moon?&nbsp; He’d said that my ears could pick up sounds in their register.</p>



<p>However, by the time I realized that, everyone around us had faded away, and a brocade fog was rising.</p>



<span id="more-169"></span>



<p>Fumiya had already noticed the odd changes, and he pulled me close, took his fan out of his kimono, and fanned it hard.</p>



<p>When he did so, the brocade fog cleared up.</p>



<p>Shockingly, the scenery had changed from before.</p>



<p>The “outside” that we saw through the openings of the line of red torii gates was as dark as the night sky.&nbsp; Gold clouds, like those painted on a folding screen, drifted to and fro.&nbsp; And directly overhead, like a gaping hole, floated the Moon.</p>



<p><em>Rattle rattle&#8230;rattle rattle&#8230;.</em></p>



<p>Countless pinwheels, like ones folded from colorful origami paper, pierced the gold clouds.&nbsp; Even without any wind, they were rattling as they spun.&nbsp; Was this the sound that I’d heard?</p>



<p>They spun.&nbsp; They spun.&nbsp; Pinwheels of all different colors.</p>



<p>Gold foil flower petals passed before my eyes, falling.</p>



<p>“The Lunar&#8230;Divine Mound.”&nbsp; Looking around at our surroundings too with a grim expression, Fumiya muttered that in a low voice.&nbsp; “This is the mound that a Minazuki with the ‘Barrier’ divine power dedicated at Fushimi Inari Shrine long, long ago.&nbsp; It is called the Lunar Divine Mound.”</p>



<p>“The Lunar Divine Mound?&nbsp; Why did we come to this place&#8230;?”</p>



<p>At unexpectedly straying into another world that I couldn’t understand, unease steadily rose in me.&nbsp; –At that moment:</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“Well, well, well, what have we here?&nbsp; If it isn’t Lord Fumiya, the Head of the main family.&nbsp; It has been a while.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Before I knew it, a black-haired youth was standing on the other side of the red torii gates.</p>



<p>He was wearing a haori as black as lacquer and held a lit paper lantern.&nbsp; Behind him, a single man wearing a kitsune mask accompanied him.&nbsp; They looked as if they had departed this floating world, and I shuddered.</p>



<p>Although I thought they might not be human, Fumiya seemed to recognize them.&nbsp; “Nobunaga&#8230;Minazuki&#8230;.”</p>



<p>At the sound of his name, the youth narrowed his long eyes still more, and he curved his lips up in a thin arc.</p>



<p>If he were also a Minazuki, then he was my relative, wasn’t he?</p>



<p>Although he was not inferior to Fumiya in any respect, he had the air of a different type of bewitchingly handsome man.&nbsp; But that smile held some chilliness, and I shuddered.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Tsk.&nbsp; Koutaro – he plotted this.”</p>



<p>I was shocked.&nbsp; It was rare for Fumiya to cluck his tongue.</p>



<p>Only, just from that, I got a sense of the trouble we were in.</p>



<p>“Well, come now, don’t be so harsh.&nbsp; You really do hate me, don’t you.”&nbsp; The black-haired youth smiled with satisfaction and handed the lantern he was carrying to the man in the kitsune mask.</p>



<p>Then, as he walked towards us, he took a dark-colored fan out of his own kimono breast.</p>



<p>“I wonder, is the lady with you your rumored betrothed?&nbsp; Lord Rikuzou Minazuki’s&#8230;daughter.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As if he also knew about me, the youth moved his gaze to me all of a sudden.</p>



<p>“I–it’s nice to meet you&#8230;, my name is Rikka Minazuki.”&nbsp; Since he was a relative, I introduced myself and bowed my head.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that, the man named Nobunaga Minazuki gave an unexpectedly kind smile.&nbsp; “It is a pleasure to meet you, Lady Rikka.&nbsp; My name is Nobunaga Minazuki.&nbsp; If I were to tell you that I am a member of the ‘Nagahama Minazuki’ cadet branch, I wonder if you would understand that?&nbsp; It is an honor to meet you.”</p>



<p>He faced me and bowed his head deeply.</p>



<p>The Nagahama Minazuki –</p>



<p>Called the secret main family, the “Nagahama Minazuki” of Shiga Prefecture was the grandest among the cadet branches and continued to watch over the hallowed ground where the celestial maiden had descended to Earth.&nbsp; Before we’d come here, I’d heard that from Fumiya.</p>



<p>Nobunaga was one of those “Nagahama Minazuki.”</p>



<p>“As your father has just passed away, it must be a difficult time for you.&nbsp; Next time, please visit Nagahama in Shiga Prefecture for sure too.&nbsp; We manage several beautiful Japanese-style hotels with a view of Lake Biwa.”</p>



<p>What?&nbsp; He was more normal than I’d thought.</p>



<p>Maybe that dread I’d felt just now had been a misunderstanding?</p>



<p>Only, next to me, Fumiya had not relaxed his wariness, and the gaze that Nobunaga directed at him was full of vague hostility.&nbsp; Here in this place that bore the Sign of the Moon, Fumiya’s eyes were like blue-green full moons, and Nobunaga’s like red full moons.</p>



<p>“Nobunaga.&nbsp; What are you planning.&nbsp; I had no intention of entering the Lunar Divine Mound.&nbsp; It was Mario, who is behind you, whose Barrier power invited us here.”</p>



<p>Nobunaga opened his fan and fanned his face lightly.&nbsp; “What, you ask, my lord.&nbsp; If not like this, we cannot even have a direct conversation, can we?&nbsp; We can’t drag the tourists into our family issues.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>My skin was prickling with nervousness.</p>



<p>Even I could see.&nbsp; These two were not on good terms.</p>



<p>“Let me tell you.”</p>



<p><em>Snap!</em></p>



<p>A light sound rang out.&nbsp; Nobunaga snapped shut his fan and stabbed its end at Fumiya.</p>



<p>All of a sudden, he lost control and burst out, “Since I was fourteen!&nbsp; I have <em>absolutely</em> detested you&#8230;!&nbsp; What’s with that sick look, like you just got it.&nbsp; I will never, in all my life, acknowledge you as the Head of the main family!!”</p>



<p>What in the world was he talking about?</p>



<p>“I know.&nbsp; Since I was twelve.&nbsp; And you’re not exactly my favorite person.&nbsp; Like a stain that just won’t come out,” Fumiya replied unconcernedly but bitingly.&nbsp; With chilly eyes that seemed to have realized precisely that.</p>



<p>The difference in their temperatures was enough to make me catch a cold.&nbsp;&nbsp; I’d been forgotten, right next to them.</p>



<p>At being called a stain, Nobunaga said, “What!&nbsp; Who got stained with cooking oil!&nbsp; No matter what you do, you will never be more than a ‘Fushimi Minazuki.’&nbsp; You’re a stopgap, temporary Head.”&nbsp; Stabbing his fan at Fumiya’s chest, with a provocative expression, he continued to fan the flames.</p>



<p>“I’m not talking about cooking stains,” Fumiya said&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Now that your predecessor, Lord Izayoi, is dead, what possible meaning lies in us cadet branches obeying you?&nbsp; No, no, none.&nbsp; Obeying you, who can’t do a single one of the special things as the Head of the main family.&nbsp; Obeying the main family, which has now lost even the robe of feathers!”</p>



<p>Opening his fan again violently, Nobunaga turned his back on us.</p>



<p>He concealed his mouth with the fan and turned back only his head, while he darted a sidelong glance my way.</p>



<p>“But&#8230;if Lady Rikka were to become the Head of the main family, that would be a different story.&nbsp; Not even Nagahama, which detests the main family, would speak a word of protest.&nbsp; I would, of course, obey her quietly.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Nobunaga – you,” Fumiya said.</p>



<p>“That would be the most proper thing, wouldn’t it?&nbsp; Say, Lady Rikka.”</p>



<p>Turning this way and walking up to me once more, Nobunaga bent over and peered into my face.</p>



<p>On instinct, I took a step back.&nbsp; Seeing that, he narrowed his eyes and chuckled.</p>



<p>Then he straightened his back and looked sidelong at Fumiya.</p>



<p>“Hey&#8230;Fumiya.&nbsp; Why are you hanging onto the position of the Head?&nbsp; Don’t you think it’s an insult to Lady Rikka, to marry a fool like you?&nbsp; Even though, by nature, it’s Lady Rikka who bears the blood to inherit the position of the Head.&nbsp; The rare female eldest child of the main family.&nbsp; The one who is closer than anyone else to the celestial maiden&#8230;Kaguya-hime.”</p>



<p>Kaguya-hime –</p>



<p>That was the same name as the main character of the “Tale of the Bamboo Cutter” that Fumiya had just told me, that was also the pseudonym given to the female eldest child of the main family.</p>



<p>“Yes,” Nobunaga said.&nbsp; “You are ‘Kaguya-hime.’&nbsp; So, Lady Rikka, it’s only fair that you choose your bridegroom from among five men, like in the ‘Tale of the Bamboo Cutter.’&nbsp; Stock up on Lunar treasures that don’t exist in this world!”</p>



<p>Five men.&nbsp; That was also the number of Minazuki cadet branches.</p>



<p>As for the Lunar treasures, they brought to mind the treasures that were supposed to be offered to “Kaguya-hime” in the “Tale of the Bamboo Cutter.”</p>



<p>At Nobunaga’s fairytale-like protest, Fumiya heaved a disgusted sigh.&nbsp; “If it’s like in the ‘Tale of the Bamboo Cutter,’ then ‘Kaguya-hime’ will return to the moon without choosing anyone, won’t she.&nbsp; Nobunaga, are you trying to say that you are suited to becoming Rikka’s bridegroom?&nbsp; Because you have a betrothed, don’t you.”</p>



<p>“In my case, I don’t have a <em>prophesied</em> betrothed.&nbsp; I can change her as much as I please.”</p>



<p>At Nobunaga’s words, Fumiya’s eyebrows twitched.&nbsp; He showed signs of quiet rage.&nbsp; “You’re always like that.&nbsp; You’d do it, you’d do anything to kick me down.”</p>



<p>However, without losing his cool, he shut the fan in front of his own lips.</p>



<p>“You hate the main family that much&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“Damn straight.”</p>



<p>Once again, Nobunaga didn’t deny it.</p>



<p>With a thin smile floating on his lips, he glared straight at Fumiya, the Head.</p>



<p>“Fumiya.&nbsp; I hate the main family that continues to treat Nagahama coldly and to frame us for crimes.&nbsp; More than anything, I hate you, you stuck-up coward.&nbsp; I will tear from you both the powers of main family, and your position, and the celestial maiden’s robe of feathers too.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I was thinking that I wanted to repair the relationship with Nagahama once more.&nbsp; We’re not our parents’ generation.”</p>



<p>“What, it’s too late now!&nbsp; No matter how much you fight it, You will be presented as the sacrificial child, and Umi will wed into Nagahama.&nbsp; And then, when Lady Rikka learns more about Minazuki affairs, she won’t choose you.&nbsp; She’ll decide to leave you.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“And then you’ll be sorry!&nbsp; You’ll have no parents or brother or sister, or even a betrothed, you’ll be incompetent and useless and all alone.”</p>



<p>Then Nobunaga gripped Fumiya’s collar with his free hand, pulled him up close, and whispered <em>something</em> into his ear.</p>



<p>From the way Fumiya’s face froze, no words could have terrified him more.</p>



<p>“P–please stop&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Unexpectedly, I tugged at Nobunaga’s arm that was gripping Fumiya’s collar.</p>



<p>It was a bold thing to do, but I was thinking that no matter what, I had to get Nobunaga off Fumiya.</p>



<p>“&#8230;What is it, Lady Rikka?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was no heat in Nobunaga’s voice.</p>



<p>His eyes looked down at me coldly and terrified me.</p>



<p>“Fumiya is – tru–trustworthy.&nbsp; I owe him my life.”&nbsp; However, only now did I realize that I had to say it.&nbsp; “From the very beginning, I decided that I would follow Fumiya.&nbsp; Therefore, Fumiya will never be alone.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Rikka,” Fumiya said.</p>



<p>Nobunaga compared my and Fumiya’s expressions and said, “Whoa, really.&nbsp; You’re already that attached to him.”</p>



<p>All of a sudden, he released the hand that was gripping Fumiya.&nbsp; This time, he used his fan to tip up my chin and peered down into my face.&nbsp; Into my eyes.</p>



<p>“Oh&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I felt as though his deep red gaze were sucking me in.</p>



<p>I couldn’t pull away my eyes, there was a mysterious sensation of bonds, and I couldn’t even breathe.</p>



<p>Then, for some reason, as if it had exploded from inside my heart, I sank into unsettled turmoil.</p>



<p>“Is Fumiya being nice to you?&nbsp; But that is nothing more than him trying to win you over and use you, you who have not received enough love from your parents.&nbsp; From now on, this man will most likely use you until he wears you out.”</p>



<p>In the depths of his eyes, I could see the Moon&#8230;.</p>



<p>“In order to get what he wants, he will drag you into it.&nbsp; You don’t understand, do you?&nbsp; Who in the world do you think is going to die?&nbsp; In this Minazuki inheritance fight, where blood washes away blood – “</p>



<p>“Stop.”</p>



<p>A single, quiet, rage-filled word from Fumiya freed my body from its stiffness.</p>



<p>“On top of that, don’t <em>look</em> at her.”</p>



<p>Even I realized that those words contained his command power.</p>



<p>Nobunaga’s gaze turned away from me, and precisely when it moved towards Fumiya, he struck Nobunaga’s hand with his fan, hard.</p>



<p>“Ow!”</p>



<p>Nobunaga gave a slightly idiotic yelp, and he dropped the fan he was holding under my chin.</p>



<p>Then, pulling back that hand, he backed up while clucking his tongue.</p>



<p>“Fumiyaaa, you&#8230;, you dare ‘command’ me!”</p>



<p>“You were in the wrong, for capturing Rikka’s attention and closing your fan.”</p>



<p>“Go jump in a lake.&nbsp; When are you going to go jump in Lake Biwa!”</p>



<p>The tense glaring between Fumiya and Nobunaga kept going.</p>



<p>Although there was no wind, their hair waved, and there was a mysterious quaking under their feet.</p>



<p>Pain, as if something were stabbing into my skin.&nbsp; Was it because they were loosing their Telekinesis at each other right now?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even the torii gates that led up to the Lunar Divine Mound were making cracking noises.</p>



<p>This was really bad, wasn’t it?&nbsp; As my nervousness and unease steadily increased:</p>



<p>“Little one, please stop it.&nbsp; At this rate, you’re going to destroy the Lunar Divine Mound.”</p>



<p>A crane’s cry sounded, as if to release the two from glaring at each other.</p>



<p>It was the man in the kitsune mask, who’d been standing behind Nobunaga this entire time.</p>



<p>The brocade mist was gradually growing thinner&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Tsk.&nbsp; Mariooo!&nbsp; You dare undo the Barrier!”</p>



<p>“Little one.&nbsp; You’re already twenty years old, so please stop picking fights like a kindergartener.&nbsp; What is this nonsense about jumping into Lake Biwa.&nbsp; My lord, please forgive the little one’s discourtesy on this occasion.”</p>



<p>“You – who’s a kindergartener!&nbsp; Also, what the heck!&nbsp; Don’t apologize to this guy!”</p>



<p>“The ‘what the heck’ is for you.&nbsp; This is the Head of the main family.&nbsp; What are <em>you</em>?”</p>



<p>Thanks to the man in the kitsune mask, the hostile mood eased all at once.</p>



<p>Fumiya also heaved a long sigh and buried his head in his hands.&nbsp; “Sorry, Mario.&nbsp; For bothering you.&nbsp; I got a bit carried away too.”</p>



<p>“No.&nbsp; No matter how you look at it, it was our little one’s fault.”</p>



<p>“You – what are you saying.”</p>



<p>“See here, little one, we’re leaving the Barrier now.&nbsp; Please stop this unseemly behavior in front of everyone.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Nobunaga ground his teeth and clucked his tongue.&nbsp; When the man in the kitsune mask held out the fallen fan, Nobunaga took it rudely, opened it, and fanned his face.</p>



<p>After a moment, his face brightened into the forced smile that he had shown in the beginning.</p>



<p>The change happened fast.</p>



<p>“I beg your pardon, Lady Rikka.&nbsp; I have the ‘Eyes’ power, and I have caused some distress, to you as well.”</p>



<p>Continuing to straighten his mussed haori coat, Nobunaga moved away from us.</p>



<p>While he was moving away from us, he was still glaring at Fumiya out of the corner of his eyes.</p>



<p>“Fumiya.&nbsp; Nagahama isn’t the only cadet branch.&nbsp; There are movements everywhere.&nbsp; To get the robe of feathers, and grind up the main family.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Well, I shall watch you flail about as hard as you can, my lord.&nbsp; Without power, you’ll drag out Lady Rikka, and how far can you get?&nbsp; &#8230;I will enjoy watching your continued agony.”</p>



<p>Then, taking the man in the kitsune mask along with him, Nobunaga vanished through the other side of the Senbon torii gates.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Fumiya.”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, Rikka.&nbsp; I’ve shown you something embarrassing.”</p>



<p>I shook my head vigorously.&nbsp; “That man – who in the world&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Nobunaga Minazuki.&nbsp; That guy is the next-generation heir of the ‘Nagahama Minazuki,’ and Umi’s betrothed.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;What.”</p>



<p>“Even though I don’t think that guy will treat my little sister Umi as if she’s important.”</p>



<p>I remembered that Umi, too, had said she had a betrothed.</p>



<p>And that she absolutely detested him.</p>



<p>“The Nagahama Minazuki suffered unfortunate treatment from my predecessor, the Head of the House Izayoi, and they are the cadet branch with the deepest hatred for the main family.”</p>



<p>“Why did they suffer unfortunate treatment?”</p>



<p>“It was probably because they’re a powerful cadet branch, with the ability to supplant the main family even.&nbsp; The previous Head, Izayoi, was extremely terrified that the cadet branches would wrest away the main family’s position.”</p>



<p>The main family and the cadet branches – although I’d heard that they fought over their inheritance and position, and were at odds with one another, I thought that their difficult circumstances seemed to distort, tangle, and entangle themselves together.</p>



<p>From Fumiya and Nobunaga’s hostility towards each other, I could grasp how much they hated each other.</p>

<p>Soon the brocade mist vanished completely, and we returned from the Lunar Divine Mound to the real world, and went down the mountain.</p>



<p>After that, we went back to the Mount Arashi main home at once.</p>



<p>The car was loaded with kimono for everyday use for me, souvenirs for everyone in the main family, and more that Chidori had prepared.</p>



<p>However, ever since meeting Nobunaga, Fumiya had been wearing a grave expression.</p>



<p>After we arrived at Mount Arashi and transported the baggage into the residence, Fumiya took me outside the house once more.</p>



<span id="more-173"></span>



<p>“Where are we going?” I asked.</p>



<p>“I am sorry that this has been so tiring for you.&nbsp; There is something that I wish to show you, no matter what.”</p>



<p>Fumiya took my hand and led me deeper and deeper into the mountain behind the residence.&nbsp; His footsteps were quick, and I realized that he was feeling impatient.</p>



<p>The madder-colored sky of sunset was dyeing the forest a deep red.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The tsukimari kappa came out of the dense grasses and gamboled about, following us while peeking at Fumiya and me.&nbsp; Fumiya didn’t shoo them away in particular.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Then we arrived at a place to which I hadn’t come before.</p>



<p>&nbsp;A large, ancient shrine stood silently in the depths of the forest.</p>



<p>&nbsp;We entered that shrine.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“?!”</p>



<p>&nbsp;I was so shocked that I yelped.&nbsp; Because enshrined there was a massive statue.</p>



<p>&nbsp;A statue of the Buddha?&nbsp; No, that wasn’t it.&nbsp; It was a statue of a celestial maiden clad in a robe of feathers.</p>



<p>Inside the shrine, both the walls and the ceiling were encircled by ancient murals.&nbsp; It was filled with the fragrance from a stick of incense, and silence.</p>



<p>The celestial maiden was seated upon a lotus blossom, wearing a smile, with her palms placed together.</p>



<p>In the midst of this sacred, solemn atmosphere, Fumiya plucked up the tsukimari kappa Number 6, who was heedlessly loitering around his feet, and set him on his shoulder.&nbsp; Looking serious, he directed his gaze upwards.</p>



<p>“This statue was created when the main family moved to these lands, and it is said to be the image of our founder, the celestial maiden.”</p>



<p>“Of our founder&#8230;?”</p>



<p>A celestial maiden image from ancient times, from which I could sense the flow of eternity.</p>



<p>Could I not take my eyes off it because it was the statue of the ancestor of a clan that existed even today, or was it simply because I felt overwhelmed?</p>



<p>“By any chance, is this what you wanted to show me?” I asked.</p>



<p>“No.&nbsp; This is merely something produced by the hands of a human who lived after the celestial maiden descended to Earth, not a Lunar World relic.&nbsp; The Lunar World relic is&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Revealing a somewhat confused expression, Fumiya clenched his fist.&nbsp; Despite the dim light, I couldn’t miss it.</p>



<p>Then he circled behind the enshrined celestial maiden image.</p>



<p>On the base of the image was a heavy, black, iron door.</p>



<p>“Inside here is a massive underground treasury.&nbsp; Important Lunar World relics that the main family has protected for generations are preserved here.&nbsp; &#8230;But for these past two years, I have not been able to enter it.”</p>



<p>“Why can’t you enter it?”</p>



<p>“After my predecessor died, there was no <em>eldest child of the main family who could open this door</em>.&nbsp; Neither I nor anyone else possessed that right.”</p>



<p>As my heart began to race, I considered what Fumiya’s story meant.</p>



<p>Then, all of a sudden, I remembered.&nbsp; What You had told me in the art room.</p>



<p>There was a door that only the eldest child of the main family could open, Lunar World relics that only he or she could use –</p>



<p>“I could open this door, right?”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; Would you like to try?”</p>



<p>Fumiya regarded me with a complicated expression.</p>



<p>Before that gaze, I couldn’t shake my head.</p>



<p>I took a deep breath and touched the iron door.</p>



<p>When I did so, a fine grid of light raced across the surface of the door.&nbsp; With precise ticking sounds, it slid open to the right and left automatically.&nbsp; I had no idea what kind of mechanism it was.&nbsp; All I could sense was that the strange, cold air that flowed out the opening bore a strong “Sign of the Moon.”</p>



<p>“It opened!” I said.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yes.”&nbsp; Fumiya wore his customary stiff expression.</p>



<p>&nbsp;It was dark inside the doors, but it looked like a staircase led down beneath the earth.</p>



<p>Number 6, who was riding on Fumiya’s shoulder, gave off a gentle light that faintly illuminated our surroundings.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The tsukimari kappa stored moonlight in their bodies and gave off light for a short while in dark places, it appeared.&nbsp; Amazing.</p>



<p>Using that light, Fumiya descended several steps.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Your hand,” he said.</p>



<p>Then he held out his hand to me.</p>



<p>His eyes seemed somehow pained, yet full of realization and patience.</p>



<p>I didn’t know what lay in his heart right now.</p>



<p>However, I took his hand and descended the stairs.</p>



<p>Just one step, followed by another, prepared for whatever awaited.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>When we descended, the underground treasury was lit faintly by a warm light.</p>



<p>Although I thought there were Lunar relics that I couldn’t see, lined up here and there for safekeeping, Fumiya didn’t give them a glance.&nbsp; He merely tugged on my hand and went deeper and deeper.</p>



<p>Then there was another staircase, and we went down, down – down.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“&#8230;This is&#8230;.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>It was the deepest part of the treasury.</p>



<p>Flower petals that glowed peach-purple caressed my cheeks.</p>



<p>A sweet fragrance.</p>



<p>The petals were torn to shreds, shattered, and swirled as they fell with a sound I could not hear.</p>



<p>A massive tree reached for the sky, stretching out broad, broad branches and leaves.</p>



<p>As if it were a cherry tree, it was abloom with pale flowers that looked blue and purple and peach, and gave off a delicate glow.&nbsp; And it was guarding something at its roots.</p>



<p>What was it?</p>



<p>A broken&#8230;ship?</p>



<p>“What – in the world&#8230;is this?”</p>



<p>I could hear my heart thumping.</p>



<p>Incomparably more than when I saw the celestial maiden statue, a ceaseless homesickness loomed over my spirits.</p>



<p>“This is the ‘Lunar floating ship.’&nbsp; For a thousand years, it has slept in this place where the moonlight cannot penetrate, guarded by the great Horai cherry.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Lunar floating ship?”</p>



<p>“It is the ship that the celestial maiden used when she descended to this world.&nbsp; It seems that it was far larger originally, but here, in this size, in this outdated state, in this broken state, it stays quietly.”</p>



<p>My eyes opened wide.&nbsp; Beyond that, the words would not come out.</p>



<p>In my imagination, the celestial maiden had descended to this Earth dancing through the sky in her robe of feathers.</p>



<p>However, just looking at that object called the “Lunar floating ship,” I was assailed by an intense “nostalgia” that gripped my chest.&nbsp; I didn’t know where it came from.</p>



<p>I didn’t understand.&nbsp; I had never seen this object before.</p>



<p>Why did I hear the rattling of pinwheels in the depths of my ears&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Rikka, do you know the story of ‘Noah’s Ark’?” Fumiya asked abruptly.</p>



<p>“Noah’s Ark&#8230;?&nbsp; Ye–yes, sort of.”</p>



<p>It was an ancient Biblical tale.</p>



<p>It was the story of how a few humans and pairs of every kind of animal had boarded an ark and escaped a great flood.</p>



<p>“This ship, too, was loaded with the celestial maiden and Lunar resources and lifeforms, little by little, and it descended to this country&#8230;to a lake named ‘Yogo,’ north of Lake Biwa.&nbsp; It is said that when it touched down on the water, part of the ship broke, and some of the Lunar lifeforms escaped.&nbsp; However, practically all of the lifeforms, plants, resources, and Lunar relics remaining on the ship were monopolized by our House Minazuki.&nbsp; Because only those who inherit the blood of the celestial maiden can handle them.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“And then, it is said, using the powers of our blood, House Minazuki curried favor in the Imperial Court and were appointed to high positions by the emperor.&nbsp; When the main family was ennobled, it moved here to Mount Arashi.&nbsp; At that time, this Lunar floating ship was also concealed within Mount Arashi.”</p>



<p>Although I thought it mysterious how they had transported something so massive, that was merely an odd event in the past, so I stared up at the Lunar floating ship, dumbfounded.</p>



<p>Dilapidated, with a long, thin, pinwheel-like object piercing into its bow, the ship listed to a side.</p>



<p>It looked as if it might rot away before my eyes.&nbsp; The Lunar World tree called the great Horai cherry was supporting it.</p>



<p>“Why – did the celestial maiden come from the Lunar World – to our world?”</p>



<p>On top of that, ferrying many lifeforms.</p>



<p>As if he found my question quite reasonable, Fumiya nodded from next to me.</p>



<p>“There are two explanations.&nbsp; One is that to the Lunar residents, our Earth might have been a penal colony for criminals&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;A penal colony – for criminals?”</p>



<p>Come to think of it, in the “Tale of the Bamboo Cutter” too, Kaguya-hime had been sent down to Earth because she had committed a crime.</p>



<p>“The other is that the Lunar World might have been dying already.&nbsp; Because if that weren’t happening, they probably wouldn’t have collected so many Lunar World resources onto a floating ship.&nbsp; In other words, it means that&#8230;the Lunar residents had to seek refuge in this land, which had originally been a penal colony.”</p>



<p>I opened my mouth slightly, but, unable to say anything, I shut it again.</p>



<p>It was an incredible story.&nbsp; It was like a tale of a science fiction world&#8230;.</p>



<p>“This ship – does it still – move?”</p>



<p>“According to ancient documents, as long as there is moonlight, it starts up and seems to float in midair while generating clouds.&nbsp; However, a thousand years ago, when they moved the ship from Lake Yogo, it broke somewhere, and it can no longer move.&nbsp; Then again, based on a legend passed down in the main family&#8230;it is said that so long as you have the celestial maiden’s robe of feathers, it’s possible to go to the ‘Lunar World’ on this ship.”</p>



<p>– The celestial maiden’s robe of feathers.</p>



<p>That was certainly the most important item in the robe-of-feathers legends.</p>



<p>Today, that name had come up both in the “Tale of the Bamboo Cutter” and from Nobunaga’s lips.</p>



<p>Kaguya-hime had returned to the Moon clad in a celestial maiden’s robe of feathers.&nbsp; If that had not been the case, she couldn’t have returned to the Moon: Everyone knew that from the fairy tale.</p>



<p>“Where is House Minazuki’s&#8230;celestial maiden’s robe of feathers?”</p>



<p>“I don’t know.”</p>



<p>Fumiya shook his head.</p>



<p>“It was House Minazuki’s greatest heirloom, but unfortunately, the previous Head of the family, Izayoi Minazuki, hid it somewhere in this world.”</p>



<p>Then, gazing sadly at the broken Lunar floating ship before our eyes, he told me:</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“The House Minazuki inheritance fight is precisely the fight to find this ‘celestial maiden’s robe of feathers’.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p><em>I want to return to the Moon.</em></p>



<p><em>I want to return to the Moon,</em> she had said.</p>



<p>A celestial maiden who wished for that could return to the Moon, as long as she had her robe of feathers, it was said.</p>



<p>However, a human man had robbed her of her robe of feathers, and the celestial maiden had had no other recourse but to become his wife, and she had died wracked by the Moon’s Return Disease.&nbsp; Afterwards, her thirst to return to the Moon had turned into a great curse for the entire family that inherited her blood.</p>



<p>All those who inherited this blood could not help instinctively wanting to return to the Moon.</p>



<p>They might not know what kind of place it was, and yet, they loved it as desperately as their home and native land –</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, Rikka.”</p>



<p>Fumiya spoke those words, looking down and apologizing to me.</p>



<p>“Why are you apologizing?”</p>



<p>“This is&#8230;.&nbsp; It is as Nobunaga said.&nbsp; I got you tangled up – in House Minazuki’s fight.&nbsp; I’m – using you.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Without your power, entering this treasury is impossible.&nbsp; The greatest reason that I wish to marry you is – this.&nbsp; The power that only the eldest child of the main family inherits, which I lack, which you possess.&nbsp; The rights of the blood.&nbsp; In the future, in the fight to find the celestial maiden’s robe of feathers, <em>you </em>will be necessary to me&#8230;.”</p>



<p>As he said that with difficulty, Fumiya covered his face with his hands.</p>



<p>Feeling confused as well, I touched his arm gently.</p>



<p>“I&#8230;I – don’t mind.&nbsp; Rather, if I can be of some use, I am glad.&nbsp; I – you saved my life.”</p>



<p>Moreover, I was using Fumiya.&nbsp; In order to cure my own loneliness and isolation.</p>



<p>“Fumiya, why do you want to get hold of the celestial maiden’s robe of feathers?”</p>



<p>“To protect my family.&nbsp; My family&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Only, it seemed that Fumiya could not get out any more words than that.</p>



<p>There were probably still things that were hard for him to say.&nbsp; I, too, was full of things he did not know.</p>



<p>However –</p>



<p>“In that case, there is no problem.”</p>



<p>Relieved, I smiled.</p>



<p>From Nobunaga and Fumiya’s conversation, I understood only that something was going on with the main family.&nbsp; Thus, just from the words “In order to protect my family,” I could trust in Fumiya.</p>



<p>If possible, I’d like to be counted among that family myself too someday&#8230;I thought.</p>



<p>While hanging onto a wish that made me want to weep.</p>



<p>“Moreover, as for trying to use me maliciously, I don’t think you can say that.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“If you didn’t tell me those things, if you didn’t show me this, then I would think that you are continuing to deceive me, continuing to cheat me, that you are using me.”</p>



<p>Being kind.&nbsp; Whitewashing things in general.</p>



<p>After all, that strategy would have made me comfortable easily.&nbsp; He could surely have won me over easily.</p>



<p>However, Fumiya had not done so.</p>



<p>I felt as if I understood why his little brother You and his little sister Umi loved him so much, why he was so important to them, yet why they worried so much about him.</p>



<p>Fumiya was enduring the intense pressure of being the Head of House Minazuki all on his own.</p>



<p>The unusual traditions of an unusual family.</p>



<p>In the midst of a destiny that his blood had wrought, somehow or other, without even really understanding it, yet without forgetting his sincerity, he was trying to be an honest person.</p>



<p>In that case, I would –</p>



<p>“Please tell me any time when I am necessary.&nbsp; I, too, would like to protect everyone.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Rikka.”</p>



<p>“Rather than thinking of it as using me, thinking of it as us helping each other is – surely&#8230;blessed.”</p>



<p>That was it.&nbsp; We might be bound to a marriage we could not escape, but we were by no means unfortunate.</p>



<p>It would be good if, as a betrothed couple, we sought a path where we understood each other, where we would be happy.</p>



<p>I didn’t consider it as us using each other, but rather as us supporting, leaning against each other.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Everything in its own time, even if I were mistaken.</p>



<p>As long as we arrived at a place of “happiness” in the end, it would be all right.</p>
