<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 3: The Business of House Minazuki</h2>



<p>Early morning on the day after I came to House Minazuki&#8217;s main family.</p>



<p>“Woooooow ~”</p>



<p>In front of the low table in the sitting room, the second son of the main family, You, was exclaiming out loud.</p>



<p>White rice, and dried wheat gluten and seaweed miso soup.&nbsp; Thick rolled omelettes with shredded perilla leaves mixed in them.</p>



<p>Boiled, seasoned strips of dried daikon radish and carrot.&nbsp; Boiled spinach with ground sesame-seed dressing.&nbsp; Kyoto-style chopped vegetables pickled in salt with red shiso leaves that had been at the back of the refrigerator.</p>



<p>In front of this simple and, moreover, standard breakfast.</p>



<p>The person who had prepared it was I.&nbsp; Because it looked as though there wasn&#8217;t anyone to prepare the daily meals in this house, I had proposed that I take that role.&nbsp; Since I had grown up in a father-child household, I had done the everyday cooking.</p>



<p>“Ahh, homemade miso soup is delicious –.&nbsp; Cooked white rice is delicious –.&nbsp; I mean, aren&#8217;t the rolled omelettes cooked too beautifully!&nbsp; No one here can make rolled omelettes.&nbsp; You&#8217;re amazing, Rikka ~”</p>



<span id="more-74"></span>



<p>“It&#8217;s not a big deal.&nbsp; It&#8217;s normal.”</p>



<p>“No, no.&nbsp; It really is.&nbsp; Plus, we just get food deliveries and convenience store bento boxes.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve missed this ~”</p>



<p>With the appetite of a growing boy, You was wolfing down the food.&nbsp; I was surprised at this.</p>



<p>Until now, I had not served my cooking to anyone besides my father.</p>



<p>It was okay to feel this way, right?</p>



<p>“Truly, thank you very much, Rikka.&nbsp; How wonderful that you&#8217;ve made this from just the ingredients in our refrigerator&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Faced with this breakfast, Fumiya was also somewhat surprised.</p>



<p>“I dug out that&#8230;dried wheat gluten and seaweed, and dried radish strips from the cupboard.&nbsp; They hadn&#8217;t been opened yet.&nbsp; It feels like there are many treasures sleeping in the kitchen.&nbsp; And then, I hadn&#8217;t expected there to be eggs and vegetables too.”</p>



<p>“Ahh, if there were vegetables, some were picked in our back field.&nbsp; Later, I&#8217;ll go do a bit of harvesting.”</p>



<p>“Back field&#8230;.&nbsp; I heard from Koutarou that you grow many things.&nbsp; Those vegetables too – it was you?”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; As part of the Minazuki family business.”</p>



<p>Family business?&nbsp; That probably meant the work Fumiya was doing already, right?</p>



<p>“The part that Big Bro consolidates in the garden and field are fit only for cooking.&nbsp; Before this, it was just somen noodles breakfast, lunch, and dinner.&nbsp; There were also days when it was just pickled vegetables and bubuduke.&nbsp; Oh, &#8216;bubuduke&#8217; means &#8216;ochazuke,&#8217; tea poured over rice.&nbsp; Seriously, feels like we&#8217;re practicing some sort of asceticism.”</p>



<p>“You can do the cooking, You.”</p>



<p>“I hate it, Big Bro, did you forget?&nbsp; I&#8217;m in charge of cleaning the baths and the chicken coop.&nbsp; Plus, don&#8217;t I always say that if I cook, I&#8217;ll get food delivered?&nbsp; Fancy sushi and fancy bento boxes from old family restaurants and such.”</p>



<p>Fumiya heaved a sigh and looked at his little brother You with a dumbfounded expression.</p>



<p>Looking like that, he sipped the miso soup.&nbsp; Then he widened his eyes a little in surprise.</p>



<p>It was probably weird because I hadn&#8217;t used the normal miso and dashi soup stock he was used to, right?</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Ho–how is it&#8230;?&nbsp; For the miso, I could only find red and white miso, so I decided on my own to mix them.&nbsp; Please tell me what you think of the seasoning and the rest honestly.&nbsp; My father preferred light foods, so maybe this is a little bland&#8230;.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Not at all, Rikka.&nbsp; That was delicious.&nbsp; I was simply a little surprised because it has been a long time since I tasted warm, homemade flavors.&nbsp; Plus I also prefer light foods,” Fumiya replied, sounding ashamed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;He ate the rolled omelette next.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Ah, it&#8217;s delicious.&nbsp; With the perilla, it smells so good.&nbsp; It&#8217;s delicious.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;d had it.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“At home, rolled omelettes with perilla in it were standard.&nbsp; I&#8217;d want to use it and buy it, and also have some left over, unfortunately&#8230;.&nbsp; When that happened, I&#8217;d chop it up and add it to rolled omelettes, and use it as one of the ingredients for Dad&#8217;s bento boxes.”</p>



<p>“Ahh, I see.”</p>



<p>With my eyes downcast, I answered in bits and pieces.&nbsp; In my heart, I heaved a deep sigh of relief.</p>



<p>I felt this nervous at having someone eat my own cooking.</p>



<p>Still, for some reason, both Fumiya&#8217;s tone and expression felt more gentle than yesterday.</p>



<p>A cold and silent air, standing still with elegance&#8230;even though that was the impression I&#8217;d gotten of the aura that surrounded the young Head, perhaps Fumiya, too, had been a little nervous yesterday.</p>



<p>“Rikka. Starting today, please take this medicine daily.”</p>



<p>After the meal, Fumiya took out something from inside his kimono.&nbsp; It was a bundled-up medicine pouch.</p>



<p>“Medicine&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a medicine that I prepared to suppress a relapse of the Moon&#8217;s Return Disease.&nbsp; You should take it after eating once a day.&nbsp; As long as it&#8217;s after a meal, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether it&#8217;s in the morning, at noon, or at night.”</p>



<p>At this age, Fumiya could already prepare medicines.&nbsp; That was amazing.</p>



<p>He would have made something like this using special materials associated with the Moon, right?</p>



<p>“I understand.&nbsp; Thank you very much.”</p>



<p>All I could do was feel gratitude.&nbsp; I thought that my body was healthy already, but precisely because I had seen my father, I knew how dangerous this disease was.</p>



<p>Now it seemed as if I would live and try my hardest for yet a little longer, I thought.&nbsp; Even though I was just a bit surprised at myself for starting to take this positive view of the future&#8230;.</p>



<p>Only, that medicine was so much more bitter than I&#8217;d imagined that I drank while fainting from agony.</p>



<p>Next to me, Fumiya watched me in dismay, and You cheered me on with a gentle, “You can do it, you can do it~”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Early in the morning, my belongings arrived.&nbsp; Home deliverymen who were related to House Minazuki carried them into my room for me.</p>



<p>From the start, I had planned to move out of the apartment, so I had already been packing.&nbsp; However, it looked as if a woman from a cadet branch had collected all of the belongings and furniture in my home and sent them to me.</p>



<p>At any rate, since the only clothing I had was the uniform I&#8217;d worn to the memorial service, it was a great help.</p>



<p>Besides that, I was very grateful that it looked like I&#8217;d gotten more or less all the daily necessities I needed.</p>



<p>Among the luggage that they carried in was an unfamiliar, elegant, Japanese chest of drawers.&nbsp; The deliverymen set that in the Japanese-style room.</p>



<p>What in the world was this?</p>



<p>Experimentally, I opened the top drawer and looked, and I got a shock.</p>



<p>Stored in it were patterned kimonos so spectacular that I had neither seen nor touched anything like them in person before now.&nbsp; In each of the other drawers, too, were kimonos.</p>



<p>“N–no way.&nbsp; These kimonos&#8230;are they&#8230;for me?”</p>



<p>My heart was thumping.&nbsp; As if I were looking at something dangerous, I peeked at the beautiful kimonos.</p>



<p>Just what you&#8217;d expect from the old, distinguished House Minazuki.</p>



<p>However, I couldn&#8217;t just wear such valuable clothing.</p>



<p>In the first place, I didn&#8217;t know how to put it on&#8230;.</p>



<p>So I acted as if I hadn&#8217;t seen it and took out a whitish blouse and light-blue skirt from among my belongings.&nbsp; First of all, I tried removing my uniform.</p>



<p>Then, I set about sorting my belongings again.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t have much to begin with, so I didn&#8217;t think it would take long to put it away.</p>



<p>However, when I opened one particular cardboard box, I gasped.</p>



<p>Gathered there were the things that my father had left behind.</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>His leather wallet.&nbsp; The jacket he wore often.&nbsp; The shoes he liked.&nbsp; A collection of poems he often read.</p>



<p>More than anything else, the pocket diary he always carried on him caught my attention.</p>



<p>I took it out and, in some confusion, tried opening it.</p>



<p>Although written in it were just notes about tasks and his schedule, something fluttered to the floor from the last page.&nbsp; When I picked it up, it was a photo.&nbsp; It was clear from a glance that it was a photo of – a wedding ceremony.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s – Dad and&#8230;Mom.”</p>



<p>I burst into a cold sweat.&nbsp; It was because I was looking at my mother&#8217;s long-ago figure, right?</p>



<p>There were the figures of a young couple, clad in a pure white dress and a tuxedo, with shining faces that you could only say were the happiest in the world, with no anxiety or doubts about the future, filled only with hope.</p>



<p>As if the ceremony had been held in a church, behind the two was beautiful stained glass.</p>



<p>When I turned the photo over, written in my father&#8217;s hand was this:</p>



<p><em>In sickness and in health, &#8217;til death do us part.</em></p>



<p>I thought that I&#8217;d heard this phrase somewhere – right.</p>



<p>It was one of the passages from the wedding vow.</p>



<p>Gradually, my heart was beating harder, and I tucked the photo back into the pocket diary and put it at the very bottom of the cardboard box.&nbsp; Then I regained awareness and steadied my breathing.&nbsp; <em>It&#8217;s okay, calm down.&nbsp; Calm down&#8230;.</em></p>



<p>By chance, the hydrangea blossom in a vase by the window caught my eye.</p>



<p>“The flower I received&#8230;from Fumiya.”</p>



<p>When I saw that pure blue, slowly, slowly, I felt my heart calm down.</p>



<p>From somewhere, I heard the sound of the antique clock alerting me that it was midday.</p>



<p>Thanks to that, I was able to switch my mood entirely, and I headed for the kitchen.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>It was about time to prepare lunch.</p>



<p>Because taking charge of the food preparations was the role I could play in this family.</p>



<p>Although I’d tried to investigate the kitchen a bit while making breakfast, apart from pickled vegetables and eggs and fresh vegetables, there weren’t many ingredients.</p>



<p>As a substitute, in the cupboard were a lot of somen and soba noodles, high-quality dashi soup stock and seasonings that seemed like they were gifts.&nbsp; For the rest, there were also cans of preserved food, dried foods, retort pouches, and so on.</p>



<p>“Hmm.&nbsp; But after all, it would be good to have meat or fish.&nbsp; It would be good if I could go shopping.”</p>



<p>Today was Sunday, but Fumiya had said that he would be working in the fields.</p>



<p>You, too, had gone to a school club activity.&nbsp; What club activities did he do?</p>



<p>Speaking of that, even though they’d said that their little sister was here, I hadn’t laid eyes on her yet.</p>



<p>She hadn’t appeared in the sitting room during breakfast either.</p>



<p>“Huh.&nbsp; Could she be avoiding me&#8230;?”</p>



<p>A strange woman who’d appeared in this house all of a sudden.&nbsp; That was me.</p>



<p>For a girl about my age, just having a stranger come to your house was probably annoying, so she would be wary.&nbsp; First of all, I needed to meet her properly and greet her!</p>



<p>“Help~, please help~~”</p>



<p>At that moment.&nbsp; From somewhere, I heard a nonsensical voice.</p>



<p>It was a very small voice, but it came from someone.&nbsp; Somewhere, it was begging for help.</p>



<p>In a panic, I went out the front entrance.&nbsp; I cupped my ears, closed my eyes, and cleared my ears.</p>



<p>“From there&#8230;?”</p>



<p>As I followed the voice and walked down a stone path, I came out on the little path in the bamboo forest that Fumiya and I had taken yesterday.</p>



<p>The voice that was calling for help was coming from around here.</p>



<p>“Oh.”</p>



<p>When I raised my head, “something” was tangled in the spider silk that stretched between the bamboo.&nbsp; It was struggling desperately.</p>



<p>The spider silk was tangled up all over it, so much so that it could no longer move.</p>



<p>“That – what is it?”</p>



<p>It was a mysterious, pale-green, living creature.&nbsp; It was moving with little bounces.</p>



<p>As I looked very, very closely, it was wearing a little plate on its head and a turtle-like shell on its back.</p>



<p>I thought that it was probably a type of yokai, something that normal humans could not see&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Please help~, help me help me.&nbsp; Can you hear my voice?”</p>



<p>Tangled up in the spider silk, the pale green creature started to cry violently.&nbsp; Coming from it, even the sorts of things it was saying sounded really adorable.</p>



<p>“I can hear you, I can hear you&#8230;!&nbsp; Wait just a moment.”</p>



<p>However, even though I stretched out my hands, I was too short to reach it.</p>



<p>When I looked around, flustered, there was a long-handled broom leaning right there, and with it, I wound up the spider silk.&nbsp; I stuck the mysterious creature to the end of the broom and lowered it, and rescued it safely.</p>



<p>“Weeell~.&nbsp; I don’t know who you are or where you come from, but I thank you deeply for your kindness.&nbsp; I will not forget what you have done for me for my entire life.&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp; Certainly.&nbsp; Probably maybe – “</p>



<p>Before my eyes, the palm-sized kid kept courteously bowing while sitting, and expressing thanks from which it didn’t seem to expect much.</p>



<p>“Hey, are you a kappa, by any chance?&nbsp; If so, I’ve seen kappas several times on the riverbank with Dad, but&#8230;with your shape, I wonder.”</p>



<p>Kappas were very hard, had a dull-green color, acted pretty macho, and smelled fishy.</p>



<p>However, this kid shook like jelly, and also had a pastel color, and didn’t smell fishy.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Above all, its round eyes and mouth were cute, like a small animal’s.&nbsp; Like a mascot character, I’d say&#8230;?</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Weeell~.&nbsp; Me is a ‘tsukimari kappa,’ a moon-ball kappa.&nbsp; Among the world of the kappas, we are the most rare, and besides, we have high awareness.&nbsp; When we’re sold on the black market, we’re recorded as a subspecies of the temari, or handball, kappa genus (luminous color, no fishy stink).&nbsp; At the market price.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Black market?&nbsp; Market price?&nbsp; In short, you’re valuable?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;I no longer understood what this little kappa was talking about.</p>



<p>Also in the same way, it stated something whose meaning was unclear: “Me is a raw food raised in the clear waters of Mount Arashi,” and before my eyes, it started to groom its flippers.</p>



<p>“Weeell~.&nbsp; Me’s flippers got cut up a bit&#8230;&nbsp; Next, me is going to say, please take me to the Boss~”</p>



<p>&nbsp;The little kappa showed me its flipper hands.</p>



<p>&nbsp;When I stared at them, its flippers were definitely a bit cut up.&nbsp; Even though it was a yokai, I wondered if that hurt.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Who’s the Boss?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The Boss is the Boss.&nbsp; Me’s employer.&nbsp; Lord Fu-mi-ya Mi-na-zu-ki.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Ahh, it’s Fumiya.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Taking the kid with me, I went to look for Fumiya.</p>

<p><em>Translator&#8217;s note: I decided to split Chapter 3 into two parts instead of three, because plotwise, there&#8217;s a better break point in the middle.  If you already read the <a href="https://thebetrothedofhouseminazuki.wordpress.com/2022/08/02/volume-1-chapter-3-1-3/">last part</a>, there&#8217;s an extra section at the end now.  Sorry about that!</em></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;The gardens of the main family were very vast.&nbsp; It seemed like I would get lost, but the kappa guided me and saved me.</p>



<p>&nbsp;As I exited the bamboo forest and came back along the cobblestones, I saw a small field that hadn’t been visible just a moment ago.</p>



<p>The narrow path bore off to the side, and when I went down it, I came out into that field.&nbsp; It was a field with a rich harvest of tomatoes, shishito chili peppers, eggplants, cucumbers, kabocha squash, and more summer vegetables.</p>



<p>However, I didn’t see Fumiya’s figure anywhere.</p>



<p>Oh.&nbsp; On the far side of the field stood a building like a magnificent glass hothouse.</p>



<p>As if beguiled, I headed there.</p>



<p>“Wow&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I was stunned.&nbsp; It was full of a refreshing atmosphere, and even though it was a hothouse, it was very cool.</p>



<p>In addition, small, platinum butterflies with mysterious patterns flitted about noiselessly.&nbsp; Every time they fluttered their wings, they sparkled.&nbsp; Following them with my gaze, I fell into a strange mood.</p>



<p>Although my attention was captured by the countless butterflies that flitted about, when I tried to take a closer look, there were rock-sugar-like fruits in this hothouse.&nbsp; Lots of them had been grown in rows.</p>



<p>“What – are these&#8230;?”</p>



<span id="more-85"></span>



<p>The way they ripened looked like strawberries, but they were transparent like ice, and cold and hard.</p>



<p>“Whoa!”</p>



<p>At some point, the small platinum butterflies had clustered around me.</p>



<p>Because so many butterflies had clustered around me, I yelped in surprise without realizing it.&nbsp; Noticing that, Fumiya abruptly poked his head out from the back of the hothouse.</p>



<p>“Rikka&#8230;!”</p>



<p>He saw me covered in platinum butterflies and ran over in a panic.</p>



<p>Mysteriously, at just a single “Disperse” from him, the butterflies lifted off me.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, Rikka.&nbsp; Those butterflies are called ‘golden ring butterflies,’ and they are one type of creature from the Lunar World.&nbsp; Are you all right?”</p>



<p>“Ye–yes, I’m all right.”</p>



<p>No, in reality, I’d gotten quite a shock&#8230;.</p>



<p>“The golden ring butterflies reacted that strongly to you.&nbsp; After all, the power of the celestial maiden’s blood is probably stronger by far in you than in me.&nbsp; In any case, the butterflies are sensitive to the fragrance of the celestial maiden’s blood and something called the Sign of the Moon.&#8221;</p>



<p>“&#8230;?”</p>



<p>Dressed in a hakama, Fumiya had tied back his sleeves with a tasuki sash.</p>



<p>He was wearing a towel around his neck and also a well-worn straw hat.</p>



<p>It was Japanese clothing, but at his workman’s outfit, I felt as if I’d seen an unexpected look.&nbsp; However, he was gardening, so of course this was normal.</p>



<p>“By the way, why are you here?”</p>



<p>“Oh!&nbsp; Um, I’m sorry for barging in.&nbsp; I was looking for you&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I cupped my palms and showed Fumiya the little kappa.&nbsp; For some reason, that kid was quietly hugging its knees on top of my palms.</p>



<p>“Number 6.&nbsp; I thought I hadn’t seen you since this morning.&nbsp; Where did you go?”</p>



<p>Pinching the kid’s shell part in his fingers, Fumiya picked it up.&nbsp; Was its name Number 6&#8230;?</p>



<p>“Weeell~.&nbsp; When me was in the bamboo forest, mastering how to cross a spiderweb, me got tangled up in it and couldn’t get it off.&nbsp; But this woman me doesn’t know came to help~”</p>



<p>“&#8230;In the bamboo forest?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Fumiya looked in my direction, so I hurriedly explained.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“I, when I was in the kitchen, there was a little voice begging desperately for help.&nbsp; When I followed that voice, this kid was&#8230;.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“I see, so he was tangled up in a spiderweb in the bamboo forest?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Fumiya understood at once.&nbsp; Perhaps this little kappa got himself tangled up in spiderwebs relatively often.&nbsp; He didn’t seem to have mastered crossing spiderwebs at all&#8230;</p>



<p>“Rikka, thank you very much.&nbsp; This tsukimari kappa is named Number 6.&nbsp; Originally, these were common, low-level yokai called temari kappas that live near the Katsura River, but they have evolved into a slightly different subspecies.&nbsp; Because of that, they are considered fairly rare.”</p>



<p>“Ah, this kid also said himself that he was rare.”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; They have beautiful moon designs on their shells.&nbsp; Please take a look.”</p>



<p>Fumiya held up Number 6 with his fingertips and showed me his shell.&nbsp; Number 6 let him do it.</p>



<p>“You’re right.&nbsp; There’s a pretty sickle moon design.”</p>



<p>“The tsukimari kappas of the Katsura River must have this type of moon design.&nbsp; Similar to Number 6, they have sickle moons, crescent moons, full moons.&nbsp; Also the characteristic of glowing when bathed in moonlight.&nbsp; It is said that this is because they come in and out of House Minazuki’s lands and continuously eat the foods of the Lunar World.”</p>



<p>“The foods of the&#8230;Lunar World.”</p>



<p>I looked around my surroundings and became conscious of something like a mysterious presence in the things cultivated here.</p>



<p>For a little while now, I’d been thinking that the plants here were ones I didn’t recognize.</p>



<p>“By chance, are the things you’re growing here like that?”</p>



<p>“Yes, that is correct.&nbsp; What you see before you are fruits brought from the Moon by the celestial maiden.&nbsp; They are called ‘treasure fruit.’&nbsp; Here, if not for the golden ring butterflies that flit about and help pollinate them, they would never bear fruit,” Fumiya explained, touching a ripening, rock-sugar-like fruit.&nbsp; “Usually, normal people cannot eat them.&nbsp; If I had to say, I’d call them an ingredient for spiritual miracle drugs?&nbsp; They’re a fruit whose quality and density and purity of spiritual energy are extraordinarily high.&nbsp; To the degree that it is said that no food containing higher-quality spiritual energy exists in this world.”</p>



<p>Spiritual energy&#8230;.&nbsp; What was it?</p>



<p>This fruit was House Minazuki’s greatest specialty product, and it really was a treasure fruit.</p>



<p>In the hothouse next to the treasure fruit, yet another type of plant was cultivated in rows, twining its way up supports.&nbsp; It sagged under the weight of long, thin vegetables that looked somehow familiar.</p>



<p>“Here are things called ‘crescent moon gourds’.”</p>



<p>“Somehow, they look like small, curved cucumbers&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; Or rather, they are almost cucumbers.&nbsp; I eat these too.&nbsp; In fact, their flavor is no different from that of cucumbers.&nbsp; But it seems that to the yokai and ayakashi, they are amazingly delicious.&nbsp; They are a product that our regular diviner and exorcist patrons buy to use as bait in their magical rituals.&nbsp; If presented with these, spirits won’t eat or attack humans.”</p>



<p>As I thought that Fumiya had just told this extremely dangerous story easily, he said, “Rikka, please look down.”</p>



<p>“Huh.&nbsp; Whaa?!”</p>



<p>Without realizing it, I yelped.&nbsp; I was so surprised that I jumped.</p>



<p>Before I knew it, small creatures were wriggling and shuffling around my feet.</p>



<p>Tsukimari kappas, the same as the Number 6 whom I’d rescued just now.&nbsp; When I looked very, very closely at this hothouse, tsukimari kappas were everywhere, crossing vines nimbly, hard at work harvesting crescent moon gourds.</p>



<p>“Weeell~.&nbsp; We’re busy, we’re busy – “</p>



<p>“Cuz it’s harvest-time.”</p>



<p>“Today too, cuz today we’re slaves to the crescent moon gourds.”</p>



<p>“One gourd is enough.”</p>



<p>What were they talking about?&nbsp; What were they talking about in their high-pitched voices?</p>



<p>Working with quick movements, the tsukimari kappas with their somewhat blank expressions were adorable.&nbsp; I would not get tired of watching them work.</p>



<p>“Because the tsukimari kappas work hard, I manage the fields and gardens with them.&nbsp; Ah, of course I pay them accordingly.&nbsp; Under our contract, one a day of their favorite food, these crescent moon gourds.”</p>



<p>“One a day&#8230;.”</p>



<p>No, this wasn’t a sweatshop.&nbsp; To the tsukimari kappas, they might not be able to ask for a better condition than this.&nbsp; Probably.</p>



<p>“Still, Fumiya.&nbsp; You’re well loved by these kids.”</p>



<p>The tsukimari kappas clustered at our feet were clinging to Fumiya like tagalongs.</p>



<p>“Boss – “&nbsp; “Boss – “</p>



<p>You could say that they were fond of him, or you could say that they adored him.</p>



<p>“It’s because they have a habit of respecting the person who feeds them as their boss, and of being fond of and following them.&nbsp; And probably, it’s also because of my voice.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Voice?”</p>



<p>Fumiya, who was still pinching Number 6 with his fingertips, set him on the ground and patted his cheek lightly.</p>



<p>“I told you the tale of the celestial maiden’s divine power.&nbsp; I said that the Minazuki are people who possess special abilities and constitutions.&nbsp; For myself, that is this&#8230;power of the ‘voice,’ which creatures that bear the Sign of the Moon cannot disregard.”</p>



<p>Fumiya spoke while touching his own throat.</p>



<p>His voice was miraculous, to be sure.&nbsp; To say that it was beautiful was superficial.&nbsp; It was calm but clear, and it made me relax.&nbsp; Even the first time I met him, I’d thought so.</p>



<p>“As for you, it must be your hearing&#8230;.&nbsp; Perhaps you have some kind of special power in your ears.&nbsp; Because it seems that you were able to hear Number 6’s voice begging for help when even I could not.”</p>



<p>“In my ears&#8230;?</p>



<p>I touched my own ears and, all of a sudden, remembered something from long ago.</p>



<p>These ears detected the “voices” and “noises” of special beings, seemingly indiscriminately.&nbsp; That was how it had all started.</p>



<p>One time, something that <em>could not be heard by the ears</em> had been the cause&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Rikka?”</p>



<p>“Oh, so–sorry.”</p>



<p>Swallowed up by a black memory, I was acting vacant.&nbsp; Fumiya probably thought it was strange.&nbsp; Avoiding the topic, I looked around this vegetable field.</p>



<p>“You’re truly amazing, Fumiya.&nbsp; We’re both high school students, and yet you’re already performing a special job.”</p>



<p>However, Fumiya gave a wry smile and averted his gaze.</p>



<p>“There’s nothing amazing about it.&nbsp; I was simply born into that family.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“It’s not something I worked hard to achieve.&nbsp; I’m merely took over what the Minazuki built up.”</p>



<p>It made me wince.</p>



<p>My words had been for the purpose of avoiding a topic.&nbsp; Perhaps I should have chosen them with much more care.</p>



<p>I thought that, like me, Fumiya had a gloomy side.</p>



<p>Why?&nbsp; I didn’t know.</p>



<p>Although the tsukimari kappas were there, managing this vegetable field alone could be no easy matter.&nbsp; However, in making an irresponsible declaration, I was still too ignorant about both Fumiya’s and House Minazuki’s affairs.</p>



<p>“Oh&#8230;, um!&nbsp; Is there something you want to have for lunch?”</p>



<p>&nbsp;This was what I said instead.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“If it’s curry or fried rice, I should be able to make it&#8230;.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;I thought he might laugh at this kind of lowly food for the masses, but Fumiya gasped.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Curry&#8230;would be good.&nbsp; Actually, Little Sister likes it.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Whoa, is that so?&nbsp; In that case, let’s make curry!”</p>



<p>By coming here, I’d gotten my hands on some intelligence about his little sister, who’d been veiled in mystery up until this point.</p>



<p>If I made curry, maybe his little sister would come eat some?&nbsp; Maybe I could meet her?</p>



<p>“But, can you make curry with that ‘empty’ refrigerator of ours?&nbsp; We don’t have curry roux cubes or meat or anything.”</p>



<p>Fumiya frowned anxiously.&nbsp; I fidgeted a little while answering.</p>



<p>“There’s unopened curry powder, so it will be all right.&nbsp; For the rest, we can substitute canned tuna for meat.&nbsp; There are a lot of cans, so may I use one?”</p>



<p>“Canned tuna?&nbsp; Of course, please go ahead.&nbsp; There are vegetables growing in the fields, so if necessary, let’s go harvest some now.”</p>



<p>We exited the hothouse, harvested some summer vegetables, and returned to the residence.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Even though Fumiya tried to help me cook lunch, he’d been working in the field since the morning, so I told him to entrust it to me.</p>



<p>During that time, it seemed that he went to take a shower.</p>



<p>“All right.&nbsp; Time to get to work.&nbsp; Because Fumiya also worked hard with the tsukimari kappas.”</p>



<p>Somehow, I was full of energy, probably because I’d seen a boy who was a high school student, just like me, working that hard at a special job?</p>



<p>The kitchen in the residence of the main family was next to the sitting room.</p>



<p>There, the room was divided into a vast earthen floor and, one step up, a room with a wooden floor.&nbsp; The construction was old-fashioned, but the room with the wooden floor had been remodeled and equipped with a modern, built-in kitchen unit.&nbsp; The cooking utensils were also relatively new and formed more-or-less a complete set, so someone had probably cooked here in the past.</p>



<p>The earthen floor ran all the way from the backdoor deep into the house, and turned into an atrium that extended up to the second story.&nbsp; I could also see the fine beams that supported the residence.&nbsp; With light shining through windows high up, it was charming and elegant.&nbsp; An ancient cooking stove had also been left there, and right above it, an old placard that had “Beware of fire” written on it had been pasted on the wall.&nbsp; It meant I should be careful about fires&#8230;?</p>



<p>“Hmm.&nbsp; This isn’t the place to stand around idly.”</p>



<p>What I planned to cook for lunch was tuna-and-tomato curry.</p>



<p>The things I prepared were canned tuna, and curry powder, and onions and tomatoes.&nbsp; And garlic and ginger, consomme and yogurt.&nbsp; These would become the curry base.</p>



<p>I had discovered an unopened can of curry powder in the cupboard.&nbsp; There was also a full set of seasonings.&nbsp; There was a container of plain yogurt whose lid was open, so I planned to take a small portion.&nbsp; Several unopened ones were waiting in reserve, so someone probably ate it every day.</p>



<p>First of all, I heated oil in a heavy pot, and stir-fried minced onion together with grated garlic and grated ginger, and salt.&nbsp; Although it was said that you should cook them until the onion was golden-brown, I focused on stir-frying it much more, until it was a dark tea color.</p>



<p>Once the onions were done, I tossed red tomatoes that I’d cut into big chunks into the pot.&nbsp; I crushed them lightly while stir-frying them, and the juices sputtered.&nbsp; At this point, I added the curry powder.&nbsp; I stir-fried it briefly, added water and consomme cubes and well-dissolved yogurt, and simmered them for a while.&nbsp; Gradually, it started to look like curry.</p>



<p>While it was simmering, I prepared the toppings.</p>



<p>The summer vegetables that Fumiya picked in the field, and eggs.</p>



<p>First, I boiled the eggs in a different pot.&nbsp; I cut the smallish eggplants into four equal pieces lengthwise, and poked holes in the skin in a grid pattern.&nbsp; As for the kabocha squash, thinly sliced.</p>



<p>The things that I’d thought were mild shishito chili peppers were apparently a Kyoto vegetable called “Fushimi chili peppers.”&nbsp; I thought they were longer and larger than normal shishito peppers.&nbsp; Fumiya had said that he liked these Kyoto vegetables.&nbsp; Since he liked them, he grew them.&nbsp; Taking them by the stems, I cut them in half.</p>



<p>I deep-fried these summer vegetable toppings without breading them.</p>



<p>I stirred them into the simmering curry.&nbsp; When I did that, the smell of spices wafted upwards.</p>



<p>It was said that several tens of types of spices and herbs were used in store-bought curry powder.</p>



<p>Into the curry, I tossed the star of the show, tuna, and simmered it a little longer.&nbsp; Finally, I adjusted the salt to taste, and after I’d stirred it all together, it was done.&nbsp; A short while later, the rice also finished cooking.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Hmm?”</p>



<p>From the direction of the sitting room came a bang.&nbsp; Fumiya had probably come up from his shower, right?</p>



<p>However, even though I opened the sliding door and checked the sitting room, there was no one there.</p>



<p>Wondering if I’d heard wrong, I headed back towards the kitchen.</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I thought I stopped breathing.</p>



<p>Because, on the earthen floor, was a girl clad in a white kimono, standing still silently.</p>



<p>She had long, gently undulating white hair, and the yukata she was wearing was also white.&nbsp; In any case, everything about her was white.</p>



<p>Even my mind was a complete, blank white.</p>



<p>“The smell of..cu&#8230;cu&#8230;ry&#8230;.”</p>



<p>The girl raised her head as if she felt dizzy.&nbsp; Her eyes bloodshot, she flew up to the room with the wooden floor and seized me by the collar.</p>



<p>“Lemme eat curryyyyyyyyy.”</p>



<p>“Aargh – !”</p>



<p>I shrieked so loudly that I shocked even myself.</p>



<p>I heard running footsteps, and the kitchen door slammed open.</p>



<p>“Are you all right, Rikka!”</p>



<p>His hair still wet from the shower, Fumiya had heard my scream and come.</p>



<p>At the sight of us, he gave a start and grabbed the white-haired, white-clad girl from behind.</p>



<p>“Umi!&nbsp; Stop it, don’t attack Rikka!”</p>



<p>“Aaaargh, lemme go, lemme go, Fumi~~, I wanna eat curry – “</p>



<p>The girl who was struggling and begging for curry wasn’t a specter or anything like that, but a solid human being.</p>



<p>Also, her name was Umi Minazuki.</p>



<p>It was Fumiya and You’s little sister.</p>
