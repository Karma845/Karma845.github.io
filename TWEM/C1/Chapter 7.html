<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 7: The People of the Cadet Branch</h2>



<p>In the morning, the tsukimari kappa assembled in the garden just outside the residence.</p>



<p>“Boss — , Boss – ”</p>



<p>They were lying in wait for the crescent moon gourds they received every day, raising a great clamor.</p>



<p>Fumiya sat on the veranda with a bucket of many crescent moon gourds.</p>



<p>“Line up in numerical order.&nbsp; One gourd each.&nbsp; Don’t rob the little ones.”</p>



<p>“Yes, Boss.”</p>



<p>The tsukimari kappa formed a single line in front of Fumiya.</p>



<p>Then they received one crescent moon gourd each.</p>



<p>I was also looking down at them from the veranda.&nbsp; However, moments later, a contest for crescent moon gourds, like a vigorous, angry scuffle, broke out.</p>



<p>“Hey, stop!&nbsp; Don’t fight!”</p>



<p>At Fumiya’s voice, the tsukimari kappa’s movements came to a dead stop.&nbsp; They answered, “Yes, Boss” and obediently listened to what he’d said.&nbsp; I was astonished.&nbsp; This must be the power of his Voice.</p>



<p>However, after obeying for a little while, another struggle broke out elsewhere.&nbsp; Fumiya brought a hand to his forehead and sighed in disgust.</p>



<p>“Hahahaha.”&nbsp; Unable to stand it, I laughed.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I apologize.&nbsp; These guys claim that they’re overly conscious about how they appear to others, but they really aren’t.”</p>



<p>“That’s why they’re cute and funny.”</p>



<p>Every day, I watched this, and I couldn’t help enjoying it.&nbsp; The tsukimari kappa’s scuffle, rolling around and shaking like jelly, didn’t have a feeling of peace about it.</p>



<p>Fumiya glanced at me.&nbsp; “By the way, Rikka, there’s something I would like to discuss with you.&nbsp; Is that all right?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;?&nbsp; Yes, what is it?”</p>



<p>“It’s about the Minazuki cadet branches.”</p>



<span id="more-149"></span>



<p>Fumiya stood, got something out of a cabinet in the sitting room, and spread it out across the low table.</p>



<p>It looked like an ancient family tree.</p>



<p>Fumiya told me that when House Minazuki moved the main family to Mount Arashi, they split the clan into six branches in order to control the Creatures of the Moon more strictly.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>The Minazuki of Mount Arashi.</p>



<p>The Minazuki of Fushimi.</p>



<p>The Minazuki of Nagahama.</p>



<p>The Minazuki of Kyotango.</p>



<p>The Minazuki of Takaishi.</p>



<p>The Minazuki of Tenkawa.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“Although the Minazuki of Mount Arashi are the main family and the other Minazuki are classified as cadet branches, in terms of scale, the `Minazuki of Nagahama’ in Shiga prefecture is the largest.&nbsp; It’s even said that Nagahama is secretly the main family, because they continue to guard the sacred location where the celestial maiden descended to Earth.&nbsp; Although, besides that, there are cadet branches with all sorts of characteristics&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Fumiya pointed at a certain cadet branch recorded on the family tree.</p>



<p>“As for me, I have a deep connection to the `Fushimi Minazuki.’&nbsp; By the way, Koutarou is one of the Fushimi Minazuki.&nbsp; Since ancient times, the Fushimi Minazuki have been responsible for supporting the main family, and both of my parents were also Fushimi Minazuki originally.”</p>



<p>I understood.&nbsp; In short, Fumiya too would have been one of the Fushimi Minazuki originally.</p>



<p>“Speaking of that, Rikka.&nbsp; Would you like to go to Fushimi with me right now?”</p>



<p>“Huh?&nbsp; Fushimi?”</p>



<p>“There’s something about that incident earlier that I would like to confirm with the Fushimi Minazuki.&nbsp; In addition, I would like to introduce you to the people of Fushimi.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”&nbsp; I froze with my mouth half open.&nbsp; Then I trembled.&nbsp; “I — I — don’t know how to wear a kimono — yet&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Huh?&nbsp; A kimono?”&nbsp; At the non sequitur, Fumiya stared at me blankly.</p>



<p>“Umi told me — that in House Minazuki, kimono are essential.”</p>



<p>“Ahh, that?&nbsp; It’s true that many people wear Japanese attire, but on the contrary, there’s no rule saying kimono are required&#8230;.”&nbsp; However, Fumiya put a finger on his chin and considered it for a moment.&nbsp; “No.&nbsp; It may be best to wear Japanese attire this time.&nbsp; Although everyday clothes are completely fine with me, this will be your first time visiting the cadet branch, so there will be faultfinding people among the Minazuki.”</p>



<p>“Ye—yes&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Perhaps because I looked uneasy, Fumiya suggested casually, “In that case, shall I help you put on your kimono?”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“I help Umi put on her kimono sometimes too&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Fumiya got that far before he realized something with a gasp.&nbsp; His face went red, and he stretched out a hand, palm up, towards me.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry!&nbsp; Normally it’s unpleasant to be dressed by a guy.&nbsp; Since you’re not my little sister&#8230;.”</p>



<p>He was uncharacteristically nervous.&nbsp; Fumiya had&#8230;.</p>



<p>“It feels like Fumi just exploded.”</p>



<p>“U—Umi&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Umi had wandered into the sitting room.&nbsp; Since she basically shut herself up in the storehouse next to the main house, it was rare for her to come to the sitting room when it wasn’t mealtime.</p>



<p>Looking proud, she cocked her right thumb at herself.&nbsp; “I will help dress Rikka!”</p>



<p>“Huh, you will&#8230;?” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Fumiya directed a look brimming with misgivings at her, Umi thumped her chest and said, “Gimme your best shot!”&nbsp; Her expression was full of confidence.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Before, even though the kimono I’d received were so beautiful and wonderful, I’d had no idea which to wear or in what scenario to wear it.</p>



<p>As I stood, bewildered, in front the chest of drawers in the Japanese-style room, Fumiya selected a kimono for me.</p>



<p>“For a casual visit like this, I think this summer kimono with a fine pattern will do.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;On the light cream kimono were painted very pale-blue vertical waves, like steam rising, and bright red flowers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The shape of this flower&#8230;.&nbsp; They were pinks, weren’t they?</p>



<p>&nbsp;The kimono was spectacular, but it also had a calm and refreshing feel to it.</p>



<p>&nbsp;As Fumiya explained, it was good to anticipate the season slightly with the kimono’s pattern.&nbsp; This kimono was painted with a summer Lunar flower called a “crimson pink.”&nbsp; In short, this kimono had been made for the Minazuki.</p>



<p>Furthermore, even in this season, I needed to wear something over it when I left the house.&nbsp; Specifically, Minazuki women wore haori coats and shawls that reminded you of the celestial maiden.&nbsp; The one that Fumiya chose for me was a white lace shawl with a transparent feel.</p>



<p>“This was a kimono that Mother wore when she was young, which she left behind in Fushimi.”</p>



<p>“What&#8230;, that’s — is it all right for me to wear it?!”&nbsp; I was totally shocked when I learned the kimono’s original owner all of a sudden.</p>



<p>Up until now, Fumiya had hardly said a word about his parents, so this was too much.</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; The kimono here — Mother will not wear them anymore.”&nbsp; Fumiya regarded the kimono before him somewhat listlessly.&nbsp; “Our mother is in a hospital in Shimogamo.&nbsp; When Father passed on, she became horribly weak&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“I&#8230;see.”</p>



<p>At these words, I understood that Fumiya’s father had already died, and his mother had been hospitalized.&nbsp; Perhaps because it was a tale that would be hard for me to ask about, Fumiya told it to me nonchalantly.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>While Umi was helping me put on the kimono, her face grew grimmer and grimmer when she got to the obi.&nbsp; A trace of unease.</p>



<p>“Huh?&nbsp; Weird, weird.&nbsp; I’m not good at tying obi.&nbsp; Big Bro—ther, oh Big Bro—ther!”</p>



<p>“Didn’t I tell you so, Umi?&nbsp; You’re used to tying yukata bunko knots&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“‘Cause I’m bad at tying taiko knots.”</p>



<p>I heard Fumiya sigh on the other side of the fusuma sliding door.</p>



<p>I was already dressed, up to the cord around my waist that went on right before the obi would, and I was standing stiffly in front of a mirror, looking terribly awkward.</p>



<p>“I beg your pardon, Rikka.&nbsp; Would it be all right for me to take care of just the obi?”&nbsp; Fumiya opened the fusuma sliding door a crack and asked with his eyes on the floor.</p>



<p>“Ye—yes.&nbsp; Please.”</p>



<p>Since I answered that way, Fumiya entered the room.</p>



<p>Even though I wasn’t standing here naked, it felt oddly embarrassing.</p>



<p>“Please excuse me.”&nbsp; Fumiya picked up the obi and stood before me.</p>



<p>Swishing sounds rang out, and his arms were around my waist.&nbsp; He was really used to tying obi and moved without hesitation, and for a moment, our faces and bodies were unexpectedly close.&nbsp; I got nervous.</p>



<p>At that moment, he yanked on the obi to tie it, and I yelped without thinking.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry.&nbsp; It’s not too tight, is it?” he asked.</p>



<p>“I—it’s fine.”</p>



<p>I felt embarrassed, after all.&nbsp; Umi had gone off to the kitchen in search of a popsicle and wasn’t here.</p>



<p>Fumiya had a serious expression of concentration, so only I was acting awkward.</p>



<p>How amazing.&nbsp; Fumiya could do all sorts of things.&nbsp; He could even help women put on their kimono.</p>



<p>I was really starting from a point where I couldn’t do anything&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Rikka?”</p>



<p>“Yes!&nbsp; I’ll try my hardest and memorize how to put it on.”</p>



<p>At my mysterious announcement, Fumiya blinked several times.&nbsp; “Once you get used to it, putting on a kimono is no big deal.&nbsp; But, compared to ordinary Western clothing, it takes time and effort.&nbsp; I truly believe that women have it rough.”</p>



<p>“Are men’s kimono not like that?”</p>



<p>“Since I wear it every day, I’m already used to it.&nbsp; But You normally almost never wears a kimono, so when he does have to, he has a hard time with it.”</p>



<p>“Haha.&nbsp; It’s true that I haven’t seen You wearing Japanese clothing yet.”</p>



<p>“That guy doesn’t really like clothing that restricts him.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Those words sounded as if they held a deeper meaning, but I didn’t understand their true significance.</p>



<p>Today, too, You had gone to a club activity and wasn’t home.&nbsp; He seemed more enthusiastic about preparing for his art school exam than about Minazuki affairs.&nbsp; I wondered if that were why he had few opportunities to wear a kimono.</p>



<p>“All done.”&nbsp; Behind me, Fumiya straightened the bulging part of the obi, and my dressing was complete.</p>



<p>The me that was reflected in the mirror was dressed properly in a kimono.&nbsp; Looking carefully, I thought that it was a refreshing, beautiful kimono.</p>



<p>“&#8230;It suits you — well,” whispered Fumiya in a reserved voice from behind me.</p>



<p>“Tha—tha—thank you.”&nbsp; Looking down shyly, I stuttered out my thanks.</p>



<p>Even though I knew it was just flattery, the compliment made me happy.</p>



<p>“This kimono — it’s lighter than I thought it would be&#8230;, it’s easier to move around than I expected?”</p>



<p>“I believe that’s most likely because the fabric of this kimono is woven from Minazuki silk.”</p>



<p>“Minazuki&#8230;silk?”</p>



<p>Speaking of that, he had told me that he’d braided the decorative cords he’d given me before from the family’s silk, too.</p>



<p>“This is the reason that the people of House Minazuki wear kimono.&nbsp; For generations, the Minazuki have prized Lunar lifeforms called `silver silkworms.’&nbsp; Fabric woven from the silk made from these cocoons is extremely light and soft.&nbsp; Because it stretches and shrinks to mold itself to the body, it’s also even called living silk.&nbsp; It’s very sturdy, and for the Minazuki, there’s nothing we feel more at ease wearing.”</p>



<p>“Whoa.&nbsp; That’s fascinating&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I picked up the sleeves of my kimono once more and tried holding them up and taking a really close look.</p>



<p>It was really comfortable for sure.&nbsp; As if it had been tailored to fit me, it felt perfect.&nbsp; In short, this must be its property of stretching or shrinking to suit the wearer’s figure.</p>



<p>In addition, I felt very light.&nbsp; Beyond the clothing being light, I felt as if my body itself had grown light, and even my mood had grown bright&#8230;.</p>



<p>“It’s said that when you wear this, even your luck improves.&nbsp; I think it’s because simply by being able to move around more easily, everything is easier to do.&nbsp; Only, if anyone other than a Minazuki wears this, it’s just a normal kimono.”</p>



<p>“Is that because&#8230;the silk of this kimono reacts to the Minazuki blood?”</p>



<p>“Yes, exactly.”&nbsp; And Fumiya lowered his voice just a bit, as if he were telling me a secret.&nbsp; “They say that the celestial maiden’s robe of feathers&#8230;that, too, was woven from the same silver silkworm’s silk.&nbsp; But making an exact replica of the celestial maiden’s robe of feathers has been impossible, these thousand years.”</p>



<p>For a thousand years — the Minazuki family had been trying to weave the same thing as the “celestial maiden’s robe of feathers” and refining their silkworm cultivation and weaving techniques.&nbsp; Although the Fushimi Minazuki had made progress in leaps and bounds during the Taisho era in the early 1900’s, they still couldn’t catch up to Lunar world technology&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Oh, Rikka.&nbsp; How will you do your hair?”</p>



<p>I was properly dressed, and Fumiya turned his attention to my hair.&nbsp; He was trying to choose hair ornaments, but I said, “I — I’ll wear these&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I already had certain hair ornaments on me.</p>



<p>They were the set of cords that Fumiya had given me previously.</p>



<p>Holding the set of cords in my mouth and peering into the mirror, I wound half of my long hair around one finger and tied it up using the cords.&nbsp; So that I wouldn’t keep him waiting, I did it quickly.</p>



<p>As I did so, Fumiya blinked in surprise.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Fumiya?”</p>



<p>“No—nothing.&nbsp; I was admiring your skill&#8230;.&nbsp; Are those cords convenient?”</p>



<p>“Ah, yes!&nbsp; I like them a lot.&nbsp; I even wear them to school.”</p>



<p>Lately, it had gotten hot, so I had more opportunities to put up my hair.&nbsp; At those times, when I put up my hair with these cords, my mood would return to normal, and I’d feel peace of mind.</p>



<p>Still, the me reflected in the mirror didn’t look like myself.&nbsp; They said that fine feathers made fine birds, so perhaps it was thanks to the beautiful kimono, or to the light makeup that Umi had applied before dressing me.</p>



<p>I’d been busy nursing my father, and in the middle of so much work, the days when my own affairs had taken second place had kept going on and on.&nbsp; It had truly been a long time since I’d gotten dressed up like this.</p>



<p>At the end, Umi applied lipstick for me, and I straightened my outfit.</p>



<p>“Umi.&nbsp; How about if you didn’t only dress sloppily at home, and if you dressed up nicely and showed your face to the Fushimi people from time to time,” Fumiya said to Umi, who was already lazing in the sitting room, crunching on a popsicle while turning on the TV.</p>



<p>“I hate that — I’m absolutely not doing that.&nbsp; Finally I’ll be alone and can stay at home and relax!”</p>



<p>Without moving away from the TV or letting go of her popsicle, Umi stubbornly refused to go out.</p>



<p>“Plus, if I’m away from home, we’ll have all sorts of problems.&nbsp; Who’ll watch the house?&nbsp; Oh, but buy me a souvenir, Big Brooother.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Seriously.”</p>



<p>In the end, it turned out that only Fumiya and I would go to Fushimi, and Umi would stay at home.</p>



<p>When we left the Mount Arashi residence and descended the stone steps, a black car was already waiting in the parking lot.</p>



<p>It was the car that the Fushimi Minazuki had sent to pick us up.</p>

<p>— Fushimi, Kyoto.</p>



<p>Although it was famous for being the location of the Fushimi Inari Shrine, to House Minazuki, it was the place where the cadet branch, the Fushimi Minazuki, managed the Lunar world weaving techniques.</p>



<p>“Ohh&#8230;.&nbsp; The houses here are so impressive too&#8230;.”</p>



<p>They were different from the main family’s one-story residence, which seemed sunk in silence beneath the greenery.&nbsp; Here, the homes were Kyoto-style townhouses that stood in rows, looking out on broad avenues.&nbsp; Their wooden lattices and insect-cage windows on the second floors and so on were striking.&nbsp; In this area, countless houses went on and on.&nbsp; It looked like they all belonged to the Fushimi Minazuki.</p>



<p>They were located right next to the Fushimi Inari Shrine, and they had such a Kyoto-like charm to them.</p>



<p>“The Fushimi Minazuki operate a kimono fabric store with a long history.&nbsp; Later, when the popularity of the Fushimi Inari Shrine led to a sudden increase in tourists, they made use of their Kyoto-style townhouse homes, and now, on the edges, they’ve opened cafés in the fronts of the houses.”</p>



<p>“Cafés in the fronts of the houses&#8230;.”</p>



<p>In the direction Fumiya was pointing, there was indeed an amazing café where you could eat matcha desserts.&nbsp; It was bustling with young women.</p>



<p>However, our destination wasn’t the café but the home of the Fushimi Minazuki.</p>



<span id="more-152"></span>



<p>We didn’t enter from the front of the kimono fabric store.&nbsp; Instead, we headed down a cobblestone tunnel between two buildings.&nbsp; Although it was dim inside the tunnel, a gentle light fell into it from the far end.</p>



<p>When we came out of the tunnel, there was a square garden, and, even further in, an entrance with a latticed door.</p>



<p>Before Fumiya lifted a hand, a rattling came from inside and the latticed door opened.</p>



<p>“Oh, you’re here, you’re here, you’ve arrived, everyone from the main family.&nbsp; I’m sorry to keep you waiting~”&nbsp; A familiar man in a suit, Koutarou Minazuki, was waiting.&nbsp; He greeted us in a cheerful, rapid-fire chatter that didn’t suit this graceful residence.&nbsp; “Rikka, welcome to Fushimi.&nbsp; Bon, too, welcome home.&nbsp; Our General Proprietress is also greatly looking forward to greeting the two of you.&nbsp; Oh, Rikka, what a kimono!&nbsp; It looks good on you~.&nbsp; By the way, have you gotten used to the Mount Arashi main home yet? &nbsp;Is there anything that’s inconvenient for you?&nbsp; How far have you gotten with Bon?”</p>



<p>“Koutarou, don’t chatter so much,” Fumiya said.&nbsp; “Let’s go up quickly.&nbsp; Don’t confuse Rikka even more&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Oh, yessir.”</p>



<p>Fumiya wore a cold expression that I’d never seen before.&nbsp; As if he could sense that quiet rage, Koutarou led the way with a “Quick quick, this way pleeease.”</p>



<p>He showed us into a sitting room and had Fumiya and me sit down side by side in the seat of honor.</p>



<p>It was a Japanese-style room from which we could see a tidy garden.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because the movement of the clouds was a little odd, it was chilly and dim.&nbsp; Out front, it was lively like a tourist district, but here it was very quiet — too quiet — and I felt nervous.</p>



<p>Even Koutarou, who always chattered, sat erect on the side of the room and waited quietly.</p>



<p>“Please pardon me.”</p>



<p>At once, the fusuma sliding doors opened, and a woman appeared.&nbsp; She was just past middle age and wore a mist-colored kimono.</p>



<p>Her beautiful, elegantly-dressed white hair and her graceful hibiscus lipstick made a strong impression on me.&nbsp; With her beautiful carriage, she placed her hands on the tatami floor, bowed her head deeply, and spoke in a dignified and profound voice.&nbsp; “Everyone from the main family.&nbsp; Welcome to the home of the Fushimi Minazuki.”</p>



<p>Fumiya, too, left his floor cushion, placed his hands on the tatami floor, and bowed his head.&nbsp; I followed suit as well.</p>



<p>The woman in the mist-colored kimono lifted her head and said, “You must be Lady Rikka.”</p>



<p>“Ye—yes ma’am.”</p>



<p>She addressed not Fumiya, who was the Head of the House, but me first.&nbsp; Then she bowed her head deeply once more.</p>



<p>“Thank you for visiting, my lady.&nbsp; I am the General Proprietress of the Fushimi Minazuki.&nbsp; My name is Chidori Minazuki.”</p>



<p>“I—it’s nice to meet you.&nbsp; My name is Rikka Minazuki&#8230;.”</p>



<p>At her refined presence, my nervousness increased.</p>



<p>“General Proprietress” meant that she was the highest-ranking woman among the Fushimi Minazuki, didn’t it?</p>



<p>Next, Chidori faced Fumiya with a prim, proper expression and greeted him.&nbsp; “My lord, it has been a long time.&nbsp; Your sullen expression remains unchanged.&nbsp; If you frown all the time, it will leave wrinkles.&nbsp; Even though you are young.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Then I’ll look just like you, Grandmother.”</p>



<p>Huh?&nbsp; Grandmother?</p>



<p>“Come now, my lord!&nbsp; I told you last time to please call me `Chidori,’ not `Grandmother.’&nbsp; You are the Head of the main family.&nbsp; You seem to forget your own status, I said.&nbsp; Even though I complained that much.&nbsp; Yes, I told you that too!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Eyes gleaming, Chidori scolded Fumiya.</p>



<p>As I gaped, Kourarou, who was waiting in attendance on the side of the room, explained, “Well, Rikka, Lady Chidori is Bon’s father’s true mother.&nbsp; In short, she is Bon’s true paternal grandmother.”</p>



<p>“What?!”&nbsp; Without realizing it, I yelped and clapped a hand to my mouth in panic.</p>



<p>Koutarou didn’t mind.&nbsp; He chattered on.&nbsp; “Although there are multiple elders here among the Fushimi Minazuki, Lady Chidori is the official General Proprietress, with the authority to speak for all the Minazuki.&nbsp; Oh, right, for Bon too, see?&nbsp; He’s just letting her complain at him like this.”</p>



<p>“I—is that the case&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“By the way, Lady Chidori has inherited the Lunar world weaving techniques and is a superior kimono artisan.&nbsp; She’s also called `Orihime,’ the Weaver Maiden, of Fushimi~”</p>



<p>“Koutarou.&nbsp; Silence,” Chidori said.</p>



<p>“Oh, yes ma’am.”</p>



<p>At Chidori’s threatening glare, Koutarou held an index finger to his lips, closed his mouth tightly, and fell silent.&nbsp; What in the world was the Orihime of Fushimi&#8230;?</p>



<p>I was getting surprised by one piece of information after another, but in the end, this lady was someone of considerable status within House Minazuki and Fumiya’s true paternal grandmother.</p>



<p>In short, she was the one who had sent Fumiya’s father to the main family as an adopted son.</p>



<p>In that case, she might not have a particularly favorable opinion of my father, the reason behind the adoption, and of me, who was born as a result, would she?</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>A maid came and set out hot green tea and Japanese confectioneries before us, but I was so nervous that I didn’t think I could eat or drink.</p>



<p>When I glanced up at Fumiya, he was wearing a more-or-less gentle expression once more.</p>



<p>Only Chidori, who sat across from us, sipped her tea naturally.&nbsp; “So, my lord.&nbsp; You honored us with a visit because you had something to discuss with me, did you not?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I have much to discuss with you, but first, I will ask a point-blank question.”&nbsp; Matter-of-factly, Fumiya fixed his own grandmother with a stare.&nbsp; “It was you&#8230;Chidori Minazuki, who released the kakure paper images at the school.”</p>



<p>Chidori raised one eyebrow.</p>



<p>Next to Fumiya, I hid my astonishment.</p>



<p>“I have also heard about the incident in which you were attacked by a kakure paper image, my lord.&nbsp; Why do you think that it was my doing?”</p>



<p>“Those kakure paper images were made from kakure kami noki trees grown by the Nagahama Minazuki.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, they were fairly old creations.”&nbsp; Fumiya stated those reasons calmly.</p>



<p>He had been investigating the kakure paper images used in that incident for a long time now.</p>



<p>He said that using the materials and chemicals at the main home, he’d examined the components and the types of Signs of the Moon, which kind of plant was used and where it was grown, and he understood the broad strokes.</p>



<p>“At first, I thought that it was the work of the Nagahama Minazuki cadet branch.&nbsp; However, if it were really the Nagahama, they would have used paper images with modern specifications, where the Sign of the Moon left by the paper images would have vanished perfectly.&nbsp; They would not have used such old ones intentionally.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Those were kakure paper images that you brought from Nagahama when you got married, Chidori.&nbsp; Because you were originally a Nagahama Minazuki.”</p>



<p>“Ohoho.&nbsp; You are correct, my lord.”&nbsp; Without defending herself, Chidori admitted it readily.</p>



<p>In the face of his grandmother’s behavior, Fumiya wore an uncomprehending expression.&nbsp; “What in the world was your intention, Chidori?”</p>



<p>“It was inevitable, my lord.&nbsp; I tested you.&nbsp; You and Lady Rikka.&nbsp; Whether the two of you are truly suitable for fulfilling your duties to the main family from this point on.”</p>



<p>Through that incident, she was testing me as well&#8230;?</p>



<p>There was silent glaring between Fumiya and Chidori.&nbsp; All of a sudden, they moved.&nbsp; Both took fans out of the breasts of their kimonos, whisked them open, and covered their mouths.</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>In the garden outside the sitting room, a gentle rain began to fall.</p>



<p>On top of that, thunder rumbled somewhere in the distance.</p>



<p>The atmosphere was fairly strained.&nbsp; I thought that I hadn’t even been here for five minutes.</p>



<p>“So, what was your verdict, Chidori?”&nbsp; At last, Fumiya spoke through his fan.</p>



<p>Fanning herself slightly, Chidori averted her gaze.&nbsp; “&#8230;Yes, well.&nbsp; My lord, you are extremely used to handling Creatures of the Moon, but I worry that you overlook important things from time to time.&nbsp; Not giving Lady Rikka your contact information gets you minus points.&nbsp; I wondered if you were a fool.”</p>



<p>“I see&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“On the other hand, it made me realize that Lady Rikka is the eldest child of the main family after all.&nbsp; She was the very first to notice the kakure paper images, she saved your life admirably, and she also appears to possess the precious `Ears’ divine power.&nbsp; More than anything, Lord Ootsuno’s coming is proof of that.”</p>



<p>“You know even that&#8230;?”&nbsp; Fumiya heaved a somewhat astonished sigh.</p>



<p>Although I didn’t understand any of what was going on, I sensed that Fumiya’s tone and the atmosphere that surrounded him had softened slightly compared to before.</p>



<p>“But Grandmother, that was a malicious thing you did.”&nbsp; Fumiya snapped shut the fan in front of his mouth.&nbsp; Only now did he address Chidori as <em>Grandmother</em>.&nbsp; “I was convinced that you had turned against the main family.&nbsp; No one can surpass the Nagahama’s hatred of the main family.”</p>



<p>At that, Chidori burst into laughter while fanning herself.&nbsp; “Please don’t say such idiotic things.&nbsp; Ever since I married into the Fushimi, I’ve led a life devoted solely to the main family.&nbsp; That is the duty of the Fushimi Minazuki.”</p>



<p>“But Grandmother, this time you went a little too far.&nbsp; What were you planning to do if the curse took effect and I dropped dead?&nbsp; Besides, the daughter of House Tsuchimikado got dragged into it.&nbsp; If we angered them, it’s only House Minazuki that will pay.”</p>



<p>“House Tsuchimikado?&nbsp; I don’t know about that.&nbsp; Fumiya too — you may be the heir of the main family, but you are not irreplaceable.&nbsp; After all, if you were the sort of man who would drop dead from this, you would be unqualified to be Head of the main family.”</p>



<p>“What a spiteful old hag.&nbsp; &#8230;.Whoops, it just slipped out.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Chidori’s hand, which was fanning herself, stopped.</p>



<p>At Fumiya’s shockingly abusive language, I too opened my eyes wide.</p>



<p>Right at this moment, a flash of lightning&#8230;.&nbsp; It lit the room.</p>



<p>“Ohoho.&nbsp; Ohohoho.&nbsp; No, I am not angry.&nbsp; I am not angry, no matter what.&nbsp; However, my lord, if you would polish your speech a bit more?&nbsp; With such vulgar language as `spiteful old hag,’ you can’t possibly match the cadet branch gang.&nbsp; Because, apart from words, you have no weapons.”</p>



<p>“No, it was clearly effective, was it not?&nbsp; Even you reacted to `old hag,’ didn’t you?&nbsp; Hahaha&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Ohoho&#8230;.&nbsp; Cheeky little brat.&nbsp; How’d you get so perverse?”&nbsp; Even though she seemed to be laughing, her eyes were not.</p>



<p>This was a noble-blooded family’s heated exchange of snide remarks and brutal honesty.</p>



<p>Because of fan items, it seemed even more like a conversation.&nbsp; While maintaining their noble dignity, they flung their anger at each other.</p>



<p>As for me, I couldn’t figure out this relationship between grandmother and grandson, and I was baffled by what was real.</p>



<p>“By the way, Lady Rikka.”</p>



<p>“Ye—yes!”</p>



<p>Addressed by Chidori all of a sudden, I straightened my back with a snap.</p>



<p>“Lady Rikka, I heard that your birthday is the sixth of June.&nbsp; You must be sixteen years of age already.”</p>



<p>I answered, “Yes,” and nodded in anticipation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chidori narrowed her eyes and smiled with satisfaction.&nbsp; “In that case, since Fumiya will turn eighteen in July, at that time you can immediately have your name entered into the family registry.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Huh?”</p>



<p>Frankly, I stared blankly.&nbsp; In an era when even engaged couples were an endangered species, few young men and women attending high school were already getting married and entering their names into the family registry.</p>



<p>More than disgust, I felt a sense of mystery, as if I were in the wrong time period or had traveled back in time.</p>



<p>“Grandmother, do you know nothing?&nbsp; The law has changed — the age of marriage for men and women both is now eighteen.”</p>



<p>“Then in two years, as soon as the law permits, please get married.”</p>



<p>“Impossible.&nbsp; I want to let Rikka have a short time of freedom, and if she wishes, I want her to attend her dream college.&nbsp; After all, even in House Minazuki, hardly anyone gets married in their teens these days, right?”&nbsp; Fumiya hastily gave his opinion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, at this, Chidori complained loudly.&nbsp; “Are you in a situation where you can speak, my lord!&nbsp; Especially when the main family of Mount Arashi is so outdated that you can’t even sense its former glory.&nbsp; It’s in danger, with a tiny shred of hope still.&nbsp; The cadet branches will not wrest away any more of the main family’s inheritance and rights!&nbsp; I want an heir as soon as possible&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“<em>Chidori</em>.”&nbsp; This time, Fumiya spoke his grandmother’s name in a low voice.</p>



<p>When he did so, Chidori gulped back her words and fell silent for a few moments.</p>



<p>Then, as if she had stopped breathing, she heaved a long sigh and muttered, “I understand.&nbsp; Perhaps I wish to say that this an old lady’s outdated mode of thought, unsuited to these times.&nbsp; However, we are the end product of the Minazuki paranormal romance tale.&nbsp; Our fate is to inherit the celestial maiden’s blood, and we are destined to guard the Creatures of the Moon in perpetuity.”</p>



<p>Now, Chidori lifted her head and looked at me alone with a sharp expression.</p>



<p>“Lady Rikka too, please understand the circumstances of my family.&nbsp; Lord Rikuzou left the Minazuki, and you were born on the outside.&nbsp; I am fully aware that this is a cruel thing to say to a young lady who has known freedom, but I will say it nonetheless.&nbsp; To resolve the consequences of your father’s actions, you, my lady, are needed in the main family.”</p>



<p>In Chidori’s words, I could sense her determination and her pride and her wrath against Father.</p>



<p>And yet, she seemed to be testing me with her words.</p>



<p>Although Fumiya tried to say something, I opened my mouth first.&nbsp; “&#8230;Um.&nbsp; Is that truly a <em>cruel thing to say</em>?”&nbsp; I felt some doubt on that point.&nbsp; “Ever since I came to House Minazuki, I have remembered how to breathe.&nbsp; Not once have I felt such anxiety that I could not sleep.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Rather, every day, the clean air and the rich greenery heal me&#8230;.&nbsp; Fumiya’s words encourage me, and I feel as if I have regained the will to live.&nbsp; I’ve remembered how to feel&#8230;.”</p>



<p>In saying this, I might make Chidori think that I was a girl who led a carefree, frivolous life.&nbsp; But ever since coming to House Minazuki, I had spent my days properly.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I see.&nbsp; Is that the case?&nbsp; You’re saying that you find it easier to live among those in the same circumstances, collected in the insect cage called Minazuki, than in freedom on the outside where no one understands you.”</p>



<p>“Grandmother!”</p>



<p>“Then, Lady Rikka, no matter what happens, please do not dodge marrying Fumiya.”&nbsp; Chidori’s words and gaze seemed to press her desire on me.</p>



<p>A request in which I sensed such strong willpower that not even Fumiya had a chance to interrupt.</p>



<p>“From the very beginning, I intended to accept this marriage to Fumiya.”&nbsp; I replied in a slow, reserved voice once more, but as if I were speaking in definite terms of what already was.</p>



<p>This time, I did not hesitate.</p>



<p>It was something I had decided on the day Fumiya came for me.</p>



<p>I was going to learn why I had been born.&nbsp; I’d sworn that to my dead father.</p>



<p>“But, but&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“?”</p>



<p>“About the timing of our marriage — Fumiya also has feelings on the matter, I think.&nbsp; He’s two years older, so in two years, he’ll be a college student, so will he be all right with me, after all?&nbsp; I — because I lag far behind him, and Fumiya also has his preferences, I think&#8230;.”</p>



<p>While I showed off my special talent for trembling, I mumbled these depressing words.&nbsp; Who knew what everyone in the room was thinking?</p>



<p>“What?&nbsp; That’s what you’ve been thinking, Rikka?”</p>



<p>At Fumiya’s reaction, Koutarou burst into laughter on the side of the room.&nbsp; “Ahahahaha!&nbsp; Don’t worry so much about that, Rikka!&nbsp; You’ll turn into Bon before he met you!”</p>



<p>Ohh, it was embarrassing.&nbsp; Still, perhaps it wasn’t a bad thing that I had put my thoughts and emotions into words.&nbsp; The previous me could not have said these things out loud.</p>



<p>“I — I’ll do my best&#8230;, I’ll catch up to Fumiya to the best of my abilities!”&nbsp; In the end, I made an enthusiastic announcement.</p>



<p>Even though Chidori alone was looking at me as if she couldn’t say a thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“&#8230;Is that the case?&nbsp; Having heard those words, I feel relieved,” she murmured and put away her signature fan.</p>



<p>Then she told me briskly, “As for the timing of your marriage, well, even if it doesn’t happen quickly, it depends on the two of you, after all.&nbsp; I, Chidori, will support you with all my strength so that you will be able to fulfill the duties of the main family, and lead a happy newlywed life.”</p>



<p>“It’s too early to talk about newlywed life, Grandmother.”</p>



<p>Chidori lightly disregarded Fumiya’s retort.&nbsp; Once more, she left her floor cushion, placed her hands on the tatami floor, and lowered her head.&nbsp; “Lady Rikka.&nbsp; Welcome home to House Minazuki.&nbsp; You are a rare female eldest child of the main family, of which there have been only three in all these generations.&nbsp; Thus, you are respected as being the closest to the celestial maiden.”</p>



<p>When I couldn’t say anything, Chidori raised her head.&nbsp; Her expression had changed completely.&nbsp; A gentle smile floated on her lips.</p>



<p>More than a proud woman of an old, distinguished family, it was simply the face of someone’s grandmother.</p>



<p>“Fundamentally, it is my grandson Fumiya who is unsuited to you.&nbsp; However, if you have accepted him, the Fushimi Minazuki welcome you from the bottom of our hearts.&nbsp; I may be biased, but my grandson Fumiya is a kind boy.&nbsp; He is like his father.&nbsp; He is honest and trustworthy, and he is concerned about the sorrows of the human heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite how he looks, he has a big heart.&nbsp; Please take care of Fumiya, my lady.”</p>



<p>Up until now she hadn’t treated Fumiya much like a grandson, but now she was praising him openly.</p>



<p>Fumiya looked as if he didn’t know what to say, and he sipped his tea to hide his embarrassment.</p>



<p>Just from that, my heart felt full to bursting.</p>



<p>Despite the Kakure Paper Image Incident, despite her violent methods&#8230;.</p>



<p>Chidori had simply been worried for Fumiya, hadn’t she? This must have been her way of spoiling her grandson and showing her love.</p>
