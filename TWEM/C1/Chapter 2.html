<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 2: The Descendants of the Celestial Maiden</h2>



<p>Long, long ago.</p>



<p>Clad in a robe of feathers that allowed her to fly through the sky, a beautiful celestial maiden descended from the world of the Moon.</p>



<p>She hung her robe of feathers on the branch of a willow tree and bathed in a lake.&nbsp; But a human man, who fell in love with her at first sight, hid her robe of feathers somewhere.</p>



<p>Having lost her robe of feathers, the celestial maiden was unable to return to the world of the Moon.</p>



<p>In the end, she became the bride of that man and bore four children.</p>



<p>The man, too, loved the celestial maiden who had become his wife from the bottom of his heart, and he continued to love her dearly.&nbsp; Furthermore, thanks to the power of her robe of feathers, he rose in the world, was appointed to an important position by the emperor at the time, and attained noble status.</p>



<p>However, it is said that every night, the celestial maiden would look up at the Moon and weep.</p>



<p><em>I want to go home.</em></p>



<p><em>I want to see you again.</em></p>



<p>It is said that she spoke that, and that she grieved and mourned.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Once again, I awoke in an unfamiliar, Japanese-style room.</p>



<p>The sunlight that shone through the shoji paper sliding door made it feel like a bright morning.</p>



<p>Slowly I got up, and I noticed the bandage wrapped around my hand.</p>



<p>“Oh, right.&nbsp; I’ve gone to the Minazuki main family.”</p>



<p>Because there was a betrothed who had been chosen for me, and I had accepted that story&#8230;.</p>



<p>Reflected in a large mirror on the opposite side of the room was my own figure.&nbsp; I saw that even though my long bangs were falling into my eyes, I still looked far better than I had just a short while ago.</p>



<p>My cheeks had a healthy color, my lips were also slightly red, and my eyes were clear.</p>



<p>Either I’d slept well, or that disease had been dealt with.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’m hungry.”</p>



<p>I touched my belly.&nbsp; There was much that I wished to think about but, to be honest, I was hungry.</p>



<p>A lot had happened yesterday, and I hadn’t eaten a thing.&nbsp; I thought that we must have been intent on driving fast down the freeway, but from where, I had no memory.&nbsp; I’d probably fallen asleep in the car.</p>



<p>Where in the world was this place?&nbsp; Could this be House Minazuki’s main home, by any chance?</p>



<p>The sounds of conversation came from the room next door.&nbsp; In addition, some kind of delicious smell came from it.</p>



<p>As if lured by it, I opened the fusuma sliding door.</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Spread haphazardly across a Japanese-style desk were fast food wrappers and boxes of French fries.</p>



<p>Right at that moment, a casually-dressed Fumiya and a man who’d removed his suit jacket were biting into breakfast muffins.</p>



<p>At my sudden appearance, both of them saw me and went stiff.&nbsp; I was also stunned once more.</p>



<p>“Oh&#8230;um.&nbsp; Good – morning.”</p>



<p>Forcing his mouth to work, Fumiya bowed his head.</p>



<p>For some reason, for a moment, I felt that he wore the expression of a nervous boy of his age.</p>



<p>“Goo–goo–good morning.”</p>



<p>I also hastily bowed my head.&nbsp; Members of a noble family, descended from a celestial maiden, wearing Japanese clothing and eating fast food made for a somewhat unexpected scene.</p>



<p>“Sorry.&nbsp; This is all there is hereabouts.&nbsp; Rikka, you’re probably hungry?&nbsp; It’s just egg muffins and such, but you don’t hate them, do you?”</p>



<p>Fumiya’s attendant, Koutarou, held out a paper bag to me.</p>



<p>“Oh, yes&#8230;I like them.&nbsp; Thank you very much.”</p>



<p>With a bob of my head, I gratefully received my breakfast.</p>



<p>On an empty stomach, a lukewarm egg muffin was very delicious.&nbsp; So delicious it made me want to cry.</p>



<p>At the sight, Koutarou looked at me and beamed.</p>



<p>Although he was an adult, it was easier to read his expressions than Fumiya’s.</p>



<p>From the way he was looking at me, I started to worry that there were crumbs stuck to my face.</p>



<p>“It’s all good, Bon.&nbsp; Such a sweet, innocent bride.&nbsp; All the Minazuki women are mean, so stay strong.”</p>



<p>“Koutarou, I’m going to tell Chidori on you.”</p>



<p>“Hey hey, no fair.&nbsp; Right now it’s off the record.”</p>



<p>Their exchange somehow gave me a glimpse into family affairs.</p>



<p>It had been a compliment, but nonetheless, I broke out in cold sweat.&nbsp; If you compared me to the two handsome men before me&#8230;.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, when he was healthy, my father had also been known in our neighborhood for his good looks.</p>



<p>Perhaps the Minazuki were a good-looking family line.&nbsp; They were the descendants of a celestial maiden, so it was possible.</p>



<p>“If you have calmed down, then let us leave this place.&nbsp; It is urgent that we return to the main home.”</p>



<p>Fumiya spoke while folding the newspaper.&nbsp; I was a little startled.</p>



<p>I’d assumed that this was the main home.&nbsp; However, it seemed that this was one of the Minazuki vacation homes that we were using while traveling.&nbsp; How many vacation homes did they <em>have</em>?</p>



<p>“That – main home of House Minazuki – where is it?” I asked timidly.</p>



<p>Fumiya lifted his head and told me in a ringing voice, “The Minazuki main home is located in Arashiyama in Kyoto.”</p>



<p>Arashiyama in Kyoto –- as everyone knew, that was a district in western Kyoto famous for its natural beauty.</p>



<p>It was said that the nobility once had their vacation homes there, but now it was a Kyoto tourist destination that many people visited.</p>



<p>However, House Minazuki’s main home was located not in the busy tourist area but in the mountains along the Katsura River, deep in Mount Arashi, precisely in the middle of the magnificent scenery.</p>



<p>“Wow&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I dragged my eyes away from the jade-colored river flowing past right next to me.</p>



<p>The deep green of the pre-summer trees was transparent in the sunlight that fell upon me.</p>



<p>When we climbed the stone steps up from the parking area, I heard the whisper of leaves rustling in the stillness.&nbsp; With the deep green, the shadows of the trees, and the sunlight that streamed through the leaves looking down on me, I sank into strange mood, as if time itself had come to a halt.</p>



<p>At last we came to a grand gate, and my jaw dropped.</p>



<p>It was an ancient, oppressive, enormous gate.&nbsp; You couldn’t help but feel overawed, as if at a long and distinguished and righteous family that had continued for a thousand years.</p>



<p>I entered through the center of the gate and was even more astounded.</p>



<p>In the middle of a mossy garden, a stone path ran all the way into the depths.</p>



<p>The sunlight that fell through the openings between slightly elevated trees shone on green moss and garden stones, and filled the entire expanse with a refreshing atmosphere.&nbsp; Scattered about were stone statues whose shapes I could not make out, and ancient carved stone lanterns and washbasins.&nbsp; Further in, I could also see a faded torii gate, which increased the mysteriousness still more.</p>



<p>Especially strange, I thought, were the slightly larger stone statues that stood quietly in a corner of the garden.</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>In a line were three stone statues, each covering its eyes, ears, or mouth, overgrown with moss.</p>



<p>They had the air of having been there for a very long time, and they naturally attracted the eye in just a slightly ominous way.&nbsp; Apart from them, more small stone statues were sprinkled here and there throughout the garden.</p>



<p>At last, I could make out a grand, ancient residence.</p>



<p>“Amazing&#8230;.&nbsp; It’s such a big residence.”</p>



<p>The wooden residence had an air about it, as if it were sinking to the bottom of the deep, dark green.</p>



<p>Its elegance forced you to feel its history, and as it completely overwhelmed me, Fumiya recited in an indifferent voice, “This residence was built about three hundred years ago, right?”</p>



<p>“Bu–built three hundred years ago?”</p>



<p>“Of course, it has been repaired repeatedly, so do not worry.&nbsp; In such vast place, at the moment, very few people live in the main home.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;?&nbsp; Your family?”</p>



<p>“My little brother and little sister.”</p>



<p>He didn’t say a word about his parents.&nbsp; I didn’t inquire any further either.</p>



<p>“However, House Minazuki is divided into many cadet branches and is scattered across various places.&nbsp; At the moment, several cadet branches even operate on a larger scale than the main family.”</p>



<p>Somehow, I thought that might be a point of contention in House Minazuki’s inheritance issues.</p>



<p>Still, it was quiet to the point of being too quiet.&nbsp; This place was.</p>



<p>I turned around and surveyed the gardens of this residence once more.&nbsp; It looked exactly like the garden of a temple with a long, distinguished history.</p>



<p>As I did so, Koutarou came up to me cheerfully and whispered in my ear, “Bon is the one who takes care of this garden~”</p>



<p>“What?&nbsp; Such a large garden – Fumiya does?!”</p>



<p>“In addition, Bon grows various things.&nbsp; Flowers and vegetables and fruits, lunar this and that.”</p>



<p>&#8230;Lunar this and that?</p>



<p>Although I was very curious about what he’d said, I couldn’t even guess at what those could be.</p>



<p>“In the case of House Minazuki, our family built its wealth on the lunar resources that the celestial maiden brought.&nbsp; We have a great many customers: diviners and magicians and exorcists who seek Lunar World resources.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Hu–huh.”</p>



<p>I no longer had any idea what Koutarou was talking about.</p>



<p>After all, the story of a celestial maiden who came from the Moon still didn’t feel real.&nbsp; Because humankind had already gone to the surface of the Moon, and they hadn’t found any traces of a civilization there.&nbsp; Supposedly.</p>



<p>Anyway, a lunar people would be space aliens&#8230;.</p>



<p>Huh?&nbsp; As I thought that Fumiya wasn’t making any jabs at Koutarou, I realized that he’d vanished at some point.&nbsp; Where had he gone?</p>



<p>“Huh~?&nbsp; There’s a strange girl at our place.&nbsp; That’s rare.”</p>



<p>Instead, from a side path in the garden, wearing his school uniform in a casual manner, appeared a boy.</p>



<p>With the tips of his hair flying up cheerfully like bird’s wings, he looked just like a modern-day high school student.&nbsp; There was an extreme gap between him and this ancient-looking, elegant place.</p>



<p>Who was he?&nbsp; I wondered if he were another member of House Minazuki.&nbsp; Over on the other side, he was also staring at me with a blank look.</p>



<p>“Hey, Koutarou, who’s this kid?” he asked.</p>



<p>“As for who she is, she’s the one who’s going to be your older-sister-in-law, You.&nbsp; Even though she’s in the same grade as you.”</p>



<p>“What?!&nbsp; That’s Big Bro’s betrothed?!&nbsp; Whoa – she really came.&nbsp; I really thought it was impossible – “</p>



<p>After getting blown away by the news for obvious reasons, he gave a deliberate cough and snapped to attention.</p>



<p>“It is a pleasure to meet you.&nbsp; I am the second son of the main family, You Minazuki.&nbsp; Please take good care of my older brother for many years to come!”</p>



<p>Unexpectedly for his frivolous appearance, he made a courteous greeting.&nbsp; Somehow, I sensed his good upbringing, which could not be hidden.</p>



<p>I, too, said once more, “It is a pleasure to meet you.&nbsp; I am Rikka Minazuki,” and bowed my head repeatedly.&nbsp; At the same time, the front door of the residence opened.</p>



<p>“I am sorry to have kept you waiting.&nbsp; Please come inside.”</p>



<p>Fumiya seemed to have opened the door for me from the inside.</p>



<p>At his urging, I entered the residence.&nbsp; When I stepped over the threshold, the air temperature seemed to change all of a sudden&#8230;.</p>



<p>The freezing sensation didn’t come from the air, I realized.</p>

<p><em>The dessert described in this chapter is an actual thing!  I&#8217;ve linked to photos in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thebetrothedofhouseminazuki.wordpress.com/resources/" target="_blank">Resources</a> page. </em></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>The residence was vast, the corridors that we walked down were broad too, and the only sound was the creaking of our footsteps.</p>



<p>First of all, I was shown to the room that I would be using from now on.</p>



<p>Although I’d pictured an old, Japanese-style room, on the contrary, it was a modern Japanese room with a wooden floor.&nbsp; Prepared in it in advance were a desk, a bookshelf, and a bed made from wood that felt deep and warm, plus a classy stained-glass lamp that was the old-fashioned part.</p>



<p>More than anything, it was the wood-framed, lattice window at the front of this room that made my eyes fly open in surprise.</p>



<p>Through the panes of glass, which were on the large side, I could see the green of maple leaves and the sturdy branches of cherry trees, the rich forest that this residence was sunk in.&nbsp; The bright new leaves outside and the black of the wood frame inside contrasted wonderfully&#8230;.</p>



<p>Aah, what a room, with such an amazing window!</p>



<span id="more-60"></span>



<p>Above all, from the silent depths of this place came a pleasant sound.</p>



<p>“There’s a sound of flowing&#8230;water.”</p>



<p>When I listened carefully, You opened the window while widening his eyes with a “Wha – ?”</p>



<p>“For sure, this is in the middle of the mountains next to the Katsura River, but you have good hearing.&nbsp; Apart from rainy days, you can hardly hear its flow in this area.”</p>



<p>With the room’s window open, a slightly clearer sound of flowing water reached my ears.</p>



<p>A pleasant, healing sound of water.&nbsp; Although this was an unfamiliar place, just having this sound nearby gave me an odd sense of peace.</p>



<p>As I stood like that, Fumiya handed me the key to the room.</p>



<p>“You may use the objects that have been prepared in this room as you please.&nbsp; I believe that your luggage and necessities will also arrive right away. &nbsp;Please&nbsp; feel free to use the six-tatami Japanese-style room next door that is connected to here as well.&nbsp; If there is anything you need, feel free to say so.”</p>



<p>“Tha–thank you very much.&nbsp; For preparing such a wonderful room for me.&nbsp; And for even arranging for the move and the paperwork for transferring schools, it looks like.&nbsp; And, that, all sorts of&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I apologized to Fumiya for being indebted to him for everything.&nbsp; Or rather, as if I were a guest.</p>



<p>Fumiya blinked twice.</p>



<p>“Not at all.&nbsp; Rather, I am sorry that you were forced to transfer away from the high school that you tested into.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;For high school, I didn’t give it any special thought besides going to the school closest to my house so I could still take care of my father.”</p>



<p>To be honest, because my father’s condition had taken a turn for the worse as soon as I entered school, I hadn’t really attended it.</p>



<p>I couldn’t really make any friends either&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Please do not worry.&nbsp; I will also be at the high school that you are transferring to, and my younger brother, You, will even be in the same class as you.&nbsp; If anything comes up, please do not hesitate to consult with this silly little brother of mine.”</p>



<p>“No kidding?&nbsp; I’ll be in the same class as your bride, Big Bro?&nbsp; No worries – I mean, what do you mean by ‘silly little brother’?”</p>



<p>“I mean exactly that.”</p>



<p>You turned towards Fumiya.&nbsp; In the middle of complaining, “That’s mean!” and “But I’m your favorite little brother!” he suddenly yelped, “Oh!&#8221; as if he’d remembered something.</p>



<p>“I mean, listen up, Big Bro!&nbsp; We can’t use the school cafeteria until the end of summer break.”</p>



<p>“What?&nbsp; What did you say?!”</p>



<p>It was unusual to see Fumiya with an amazingly anxious expression.</p>



<p>“I hate eating convenience store bento boxes and instant noodles morning, noon, and night.&nbsp; It’s about time we hire a maid.&nbsp; This time, we’ll find an honest person who won’t attack you in your sleep.”</p>



<p>“Mmm, just in case, we’ll put that in the request.”</p>



<p>For some reason, the brothers sounded serious as they discussed it.</p>



<p>Hearing that you could get attacked in your sleep gave me the impression of a dangerous world.</p>



<p>Even though I recalled this morning’s fast food, I wondered if even the sons of a good old family ate convenience store bento boxes and instant noodles on a regular basis?</p>



<p>“In fact, though this house is so big, there isn’t a single staff member.”</p>



<p>At the voice from behind me, I turned around.&nbsp; It was Koutarou again.</p>



<p>Grinning to himself, he explained this to me in detail.</p>



<p>“Even though there was one, until recently.&nbsp; Well, there was a minor incident.&nbsp; Bon got attacked in his sleep in an assassination attempt, right?”</p>



<p>“What?!”</p>



<p>“These things happen in House Minazuki when we’re fighting over inheritance issues!&nbsp; Haha.”</p>



<p>Although Koutarou spoke laughingly, if that were true, this really wasn’t a normal family.</p>



<p>You could say that both Fumiya and You went about their lives while they were in mortal danger, right?</p>



<p>If they weren’t hiring a maid in order to avert those crises, perhaps they lived with a lot of inconveniences in this big house.</p>



<p>However, if that were the case, then it looked like I wouldn’t be just a burden on this family.&nbsp; Rather, there were things I could do.</p>



<p>After that, after I’d gotten a tour of more or less the whole residence, I was ushered into a vast tatami room.&nbsp; All the doors to the veranda were wide open.</p>



<p>As I sat down without protest on the floor cushion that Fumiya offered me, You suddenly came from the veranda.&nbsp; He set chilled green tea and a tea sweet before me.</p>



<p>“Wow&#8230;it’s pretty.”</p>



<p>On its own, my heart pounded when I saw the natsumikan kanten jelly cold dessert.</p>



<p>It used a real natsumikan mandarin peel for the bowl, and it was a very lovely sight.</p>



<p>The translucent orange of the kanten jelly was beautiful, and accompanied by a refreshing aroma too, and I was completely captivated.</p>



<p>“We bought them at a Japanese confectionary shop in Arashiyama called `Oimatsu,’ or `Old Pine.’&nbsp; These sweets are called natsukantou, summer mandarin candies.&nbsp; You can only get them in this season, and they’re chilled, so I think they’re good.”</p>



<p>You grinned and set one in front of his older brother, Fumiya, as well.&nbsp; It seemed like he had his own share too, and taking it, he sat down on the wide-open veranda.</p>



<p>Speaking of that, Koutarou wasn’t there.&nbsp; As I wondered where he’d gone, Fumiya told me that Koutarou had gone out to buy dinner.</p>



<p>“If you will relax and have some tea for the time being.&nbsp; Please help yourself.”</p>



<p>“Ye–yes.&nbsp; &#8230;Thank you for the food.”</p>



<p>I was really looking forward to it, so I took a spoonful of the natsumikan kanten jelly.</p>



<p>Its freshness made my eyes fly open wide.&nbsp; The aftertaste was refreshing and held no impurities.</p>



<p>The bitterness of the natsumikan came through clearly, and more than anything, the strong citrus fragrance took me by surprise.</p>



<p>It was so simple and elegant that I breathed a sigh.&nbsp; That cool flavor, when summer was just approaching, intoxicated me for a brief moment.</p>



<p>The wind-bell on the veranda chimed.</p>



<p>The fusama sliding doors were wide open, the ventilation was good, and we were surrounded by the veranda, so I felt very reinvigorated.</p>



<p>The quietness, the deliciousness, the freshness were healing.&nbsp; It had been a truly long time since I’d spent a period like this, I thought.</p>



<p>“Is it to your liking?”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; It’s very good.&nbsp; I love the smell of citrus fruits&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Mandarins and oranges and lemons.&nbsp; This fragrance calmed my heart.</p>



<p>“I biked like crazy to go out to buy them.&nbsp; ‘Cuz Big Bro told me to get something girls like ~ ”</p>



<p>“Y–you idiot, You!”</p>



<p>Fumiya’s face went red, and he turned and raised his voice at You, who was on the veranda.&nbsp; At once, however, he gasped and gave a deliberate cough.</p>



<p>That was unusual.&nbsp; Fumiya, who always behaved so maturely and politely, had showed a reaction towards his little brother, You, like a boy his age.&nbsp; Well, that was family-like and heartwarming.</p>



<p>“Haha.&nbsp; The two of you are close.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Fumiya’s and You’s eyes went wide.&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; Had I said something weird?</p>



<p>“At last, she laughed!&nbsp; Rikka did.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“Was our big brother-little brother skit that funny?&nbsp; Wanna hear embarrassing stories about Big Bro?”</p>



<p>“Hey, You&#8230;!”</p>



<p>“It’s a joke, Big Bro.&nbsp; Don’t take it so seriously.”</p>



<p>As for me, I fell silent and thought about it for a moment.&nbsp; When You pointed it out, it was the first time I noticed that I hadn’t laughed once since coming here.</p>



<p>No, that wasn’t right.&nbsp; It wasn’t just since I came here.&nbsp; It had been a while now.</p>



<p>“Rikka?”</p>



<p>“N–no.&nbsp; It’s nothing.”</p>



<p>To be honest, I was averting my eyes.&nbsp; I was shaken.</p>



<p>What a failure I was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;After Dad’s death, I hadn’t recovered quickly, and I seemed to have given up on all of my own affairs.</p>



<p>More than anything, I didn’t want to make everyone in this family that would be taking care of me from now on feel bad.</p>



<p>Because I had consented to it, accepted it, prepared myself, and come to the main family.</p>



<p>“Excuse me.&nbsp; Speaking of that, where is your little sister?&nbsp; Is she still at school?&nbsp; I would like to greet her.”</p>



<p>I forced myself to smile and asked that as if I were avoiding the topic.&nbsp; This time, it was Fumiya and You who gave a start and averted their eyes.</p>



<p>“N–no.&nbsp; She – Little Sister is a bit busy,” said Fumiya.</p>



<p>“That girl doesn’t come out of her room very willingly.&nbsp; Well, if you see a white-haired zashiki-warashi prankster spirit in the house, that’s our little sister,” said You.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’m sorry?”</p>



<p>House Minazuki really wasn’t normal.&nbsp; Whenever I felt like I understood things, there were just more riddles.</p>



<p>“Rikka, I believe that you must have a mountain’s worth of questions you would like to ask me.&nbsp; To the extent that it is possible, I intend to answer them.&nbsp; If you have any questions, ask anything you wish.”</p>

<p>Once things had calmed down, Fumiya and I began a serious conversation.</p>



<p>“Um&#8230;.&nbsp; My father – was he born in this house?”</p>



<p>“Yes, of course.&nbsp; Mr. Rikuzou was the legitimate heir to the main family.”</p>



<p>With downcast eyes, Fumiya continued the story.</p>



<p>“Mr. Rikuzou opposed marrying the woman that the late Head, Izayoi Minazuki, had in mind.&nbsp; He left this family and concealed his whereabouts.&nbsp; As a result, the main family fell into a situation where it had no heir, and Izayoi adopted the son of his own second son into the main family.&nbsp; That was my father.&nbsp; That was how it began and why I succeeded to the seat of the current Head.”</p>



<p>In short, the man who had opposed Mom and Dad&#8217;s marriage was Fumiya&#8217;s and my great-grandfather, Izayoi Minazuki.&nbsp; As a side note, it seemed that Dad&#8217;s father, who would have been my paternal grandfather, had died young.</p>



<span id="more-67"></span>



<p>That was what Fumiya told me.</p>



<p>He said that the late Head of House Minazuki, Izayoi Minazuki, was an extremely strict, horrible person.</p>



<p>“Actually, the late Head Izayoi&#8217;s death about two years ago was the beginning of our House Minazuki&#8217;s inheritance feud.”</p>



<p>“Those flames&#8230;that attacked us, yesterday&#8230;?”</p>



<p>It had happened suddenly.&nbsp; I vividly remembered the color of those flames that had surrounded us.</p>



<p>They had clearly acted like things set free to hunt.</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; I&#8217;m afraid that they were probably the work of a member of a cadet branch of House Minazuki.&nbsp; The cadet branches do not recognize me as the new Head, fight over Izayoi Minazuki&#8217;s legacy, and pose a threat.&nbsp; If I were a firmer Head, this dispute would not have arisen&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Fumiya had a complicated expression on his face.</p>



<p>Although he wasn&#8217;t really an emotional person, I could tell that he was suffering from these troublesome affairs.</p>



<p>“As a result, I allowed you to be put in danger last night.&nbsp; I am deeply sorry for that.”</p>



<p>Fumiya conscientiously bowed his head, and I shook mine vigorously.</p>



<p>Because I thought that if House Minazuki were a family with a long history, then inheritance feuds would also be major.</p>



<p>“Even if Great-Grandfather Izayoi were a crazy, yokai-like person.&nbsp; The yokai are probably preferable.&nbsp; It&#8217;s for the best that you didn&#8217;t meet him, Rikka.&nbsp; He was definitely obsessed.&nbsp; With the daughter of Rikuzou Minazuki.”</p>



<p>Even You turned this way from the veranda and spoke up.&nbsp; My great-grandpa was such a horrible person that it was said that even yokai were preferable?</p>



<p>“Why was he obsessed with&#8230;the daughter of Rikuzou Minazuki?”</p>



<p>“He seemed to have considerable expectations for Mr. Rikuzou as the heir of House Minazuki.&nbsp; It is said that Mr. Rikuzou was unsurpassed in the ‘divine power of the celestial maiden&#8217;.”</p>



<p>At Fumiya&#8217;s answer, I tilted my head more and more.</p>



<p>The divine power of the celestial maiden was&#8230;what?</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s correct.&nbsp; To put it in a way that&#8217;s easy to understand, he had something called special abilities.&nbsp; In accordance with the thickness of their blood, the Minazuki are born with <em>this sort of</em> power.”</p>



<p>All of a sudden – the plates before my eyes gently floated up and, while forming a stack mid-air, moved to the tray next to You on the veranda.&nbsp; They tidily arranged themselves on it.</p>



<p>You looked at his older brother Fumiya and pouted, “Clearing the table, huh?”</p>



<p>As for me, I thought that I&#8217;d probably gone white and was trembling.</p>



<p>“Do–don&#8217;t tell me&#8230;this strange phenomenon&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Yes, I did it.&nbsp; The ability to manipulate objects like this, with thought alone, is called ‘telekinesis.&#8217;&nbsp; Whether it is your strength or weakness, as long as you&#8217;re a member of House Minazuki, you will have the ability to do it.&nbsp; The power of the thoughts of the people of the Moon is probably much stronger than that of humans on Earth.&nbsp; Apart from that, everyone is born with a special constitution and has abilities.&nbsp; House Minazuki holds the lunar resources that the celestial maiden brought and these divine powers, and for a thousand years, the Minazuki have played leading roles in the spirit capital.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Rikka, are you following ~ ?”</p>



<p>At You&#8217;s voice, I gasped and bobbed my head.</p>



<p>“Ye–yes, I&#8217;m all right.&nbsp; This kind of power just now – my father definitely had it too.”</p>



<p>Even though I&#8217;d been caught by surprise, as a matter of fact, Dad had also had this kind of power.</p>



<p>Rather, what had startled me was that Fumiya was the same as Dad.</p>



<p>Usually, Dad didn&#8217;t use the sort of telekinesis that Fumiya had just demonstrated, but sometimes he showed it to me.&nbsp; I&#8217;d always assumed that it was sleight of hand or something like that.</p>



<p>That hadn&#8217;t been it, either.&nbsp; Dad could see things that normal humans could not, and for as long as I could remember, so could I.</p>



<p>Dad had said that those kinds of things were ayakashi and yokai and specters and so on.</p>



<p>“At last&#8230;at last I can understand.&nbsp; Why my father was different from normal humans.”</p>



<p>Those had been the special abilities of people who inherited the blood of the celestial maiden.</p>



<p>I understood it.&nbsp; I drank it in.&nbsp; I comprehended it perfectly&#8230;or would.</p>



<p>“In order to preserve the power of the celestial maiden&#8217;s blood, as a general rule among the members of House Minazuki, a betrothed is selected for us from the main family or the five cadet branches, from the time we are very young.&nbsp; A normal, romantic marriage is never recognized.&nbsp; Especially if you don&#8217;t leave the family and run off somewhere as Mr. Rikuzou did&#8230;.”</p>



<p>At this point, Fumiya gulped back his words.</p>



<p>“I apologize.&nbsp; I have said something impolite.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;That&#8217;s all right.”</p>



<p>I gave a little shake of my head.&nbsp; I was shocked that House Minazuki had this kind of custom.</p>



<p>Plus, it was a bond that more or less went against the times, that left no room for free choice.</p>



<p>I had heard that my father, too, had had a betrothed selected for him from the time he was very young.&nbsp; My father had thrown away that person and fled from this family with my mother.</p>



<p>The main family and cadet branches, inheritance feuds, divine powers, marriage conditions&#8230;.</p>



<p>Just hearing about these forced me to realize that this House Minazuki was by no means a normal family.&nbsp; The sensation was entirely like that of setting foot in an unknown world.&nbsp; But at the same time, there were things that I knew at last and things that I could understand, and my heart felt oddly refreshed.</p>



<p>The circumstances of the complicated House Minazuki that my father had escaped.</p>



<p>On my own, I had thrown myself into them.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>That evening.&nbsp; Led by Fumiya and carrying my father&#8217;s urn, I was walking along a path through the bamboo forest on the mountain behind the main home.</p>



<p>When I lifted my head, through an opening in the bamboo forest that hung overhead, I could see the white, thin crescent Moon floating in the June sunset sky.</p>



<p>The Moon.&nbsp; I wondered if the celestial maiden who was House Minazuki&#8217;s ancestor really had come from there.</p>



<p>Although I still found it unbelievable, I too had inherited the blood of the lunar people.</p>



<p>Oh, but.&nbsp; As if I were sniffing somewhere, there was a scent of the bamboo forest and the air of the summer evening.</p>



<p><em>Rustle rustle&#8230;rustle rustle&#8230;.</em></p>



<p>Surrounded by the sounds of bamboo leaves swaying and brushing against one another, I drew a deep breath.</p>



<p>Even though I knew the smell of automobile exhaust in the city, I was not accustomed to this smell.</p>



<p>Despite that, it was so terribly familiar.&nbsp; I began to feel as if I had come home to somewhere.</p>



<p>“Rikka, please come this way.”</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>In the depths of the bamboo forest was a dignified tomb.</p>



<p>It was so ancient that just looking at it gave me a slight chill.</p>



<p>“I apologize.&nbsp; Normally, it&#8217;s not a place we would come to at this time of day.”</p>



<p>“It–it&#8217;s all right.&nbsp; But if I were alone, it would probably be a scary place.”</p>



<p>The tomb of the main family, where my ancestor the celestial maiden slept.&nbsp; I could feel its history, but it was well maintained, and beautiful flowers whose names I did not know were offered before it.</p>



<p>We laid my father&#8217;s urn to rest in that tomb.&nbsp; Fumiya said that it was customary to dedicate the remains of members of House Minazuki quietly, at the time when the Moon began to shine.</p>



<p>After we had laid my father&#8217;s ashes in the tomb, Fumiya lit a stick of incense.&nbsp; Its fragrance wafted gently through the air, and somehow&#8230;somehow that made me flash back to my father&#8217;s death.</p>



<p>Entering the tomb of this main family after the service that marked the end of mourning: It seemed as though my father had foreseen this in his last moments and entrusted it to Fumiya.&nbsp; The bodies of members of the House Minazuki were pretty unique from the beginning, and even when they turned to ash, it seemed that they could still be used.&nbsp; In any case, keeping them in the outside world would be dangerous.</p>



<p>In the end, my father could not escape from this family.&nbsp; That was that.</p>



<p>“Mr. Rikuzou said that the main reason he wanted to enter the main family&#8217;s tomb was that you would be here.&nbsp; He probably wished to be at your side and continue to watch over you.”</p>



<p>Perhaps guessing at my complicated emotions, Fumiya told me that.</p>



<p>I placed my hands together before the tomb and closed my eyes.</p>



<p>In this place slept my father and all those who had given birth to and raised him.&nbsp; Here were the origins of my existence.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Fumiya.&nbsp; There&#8217;s something I think is strange.&nbsp; Is it all right to ask you?”</p>



<p>Opening my eyes slightly, I asked Fumiya, who was right next to me.</p>



<p>“Yes, please go ahead.”</p>



<p>“Starting about a month before he died, my father would look out the window at the Moon and babble&#8230;’I want to go home,&#8217;&nbsp; ‘I want to see you.&#8217;&nbsp; What in the world was that?”</p>



<p>Lying facedown on his sickbed, at the end my father was practically unable to move, and his faint words were rare too.</p>



<p>However, on days when the moonlight shone through the window, he would whisper in a hoarse voice, “I want to go home” and “I want to see you” and stare intently up at the Moon in the night sky.</p>



<p>“That is one of the symptoms of the ‘Moon&#8217;s Return Disease.&#8217;&nbsp; Without exception, those who develop it are held captive by homesickness for the Moon.&nbsp; The seeds that have sprouted demand moonlight and cause their host to act like that.”</p>



<p>Fumiya discussed it like a Minazuki human who knew what he was talking about.</p>



<p>“Is that so?&nbsp; &#8230;I just thought that that my father must have wanted to see ‘Mother.&#8217;&nbsp; Because it was my fault that my father and my mother got divorced.”</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t know whether Fumiya knew about the relationships between me and my father and my mother and my older twin sister.</p>



<p>But he glanced at me and kept speaking in a calm voice.</p>



<p>“The Mr. Rikuzou whom I saw was more worried about you than about anyone else.&nbsp; If that were not the case, he probably would not have set foot in this main home that he hated, that he swore he would not visit a second time.&nbsp; I was only a child, but he bowed his head to me&#8230;and tried to entrust you to me.”</p>



<p>My lips trembling, I listened to Fumiya&#8217;s words as he stood next to me.</p>



<p>Many different thoughts warred with one another.&nbsp; Fumiya didn&#8217;t know \textit{those words} that my father had uttered in his last moments.</p>



<p>However, I also wanted to believe that it was true that my father was here to try to watch over me, as Fumiya said.</p>



<p>“Mr. Rikuzou said something.&nbsp; That he wanted to protect your smile.&nbsp; &#8230;But, Rikka.&nbsp; In front of me, you don&#8217;t have to force yourself to smile.”</p>



<p>“Uh&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Surprised, I looked up at Fumiya.</p>



<p>Had he perhaps noticed my confusion at the “She laughed” business during the day?&nbsp; And also my unnatural smile afterwards.</p>



<p>“Of course, you do not need to restrain yourself from smiling either.&nbsp; However, forcing yourself to smile is simply exhausting.&nbsp; I, too, find it difficult to smile.”</p>



<p>Thinking of something, Fumiya took a pair of pruning shears out of the breast of his kimono.&nbsp; Using them, he clipped off the stem of a hydrangea blossom that was blooming nearby.</p>



<p>“For a long time now, you have worked very hard on your own.&nbsp; Now, in this quiet place and at your own pace, just take your time to rest your body and your heart, please.”</p>



<p>And he held the hydrangea blossom out to me.</p>



<p>A large hydrangea blossom.</p>



<p>Under the crescent Moon that floated in the dim sky just before nightfall, it still bloomed vividly.</p>



<p>Confused, checking that I understood right, I accepted the hydrangea blossom that Fumiya held out.</p>



<p>It had an unmistakably pure blue color.</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Ah&#8230;that was right.</p>



<p>My heart had already been at its limit for a long time now.&nbsp; To the point where it was numb to all emotions.</p>



<p>Taking care of my dying father all by myself, saying farewell to that father, being eaten away by loneliness and anxiety and disease&#8230;.</p>



<p>Fumiya had probably noticed those things from the moment he met me.</p>



<p>“Tha–thank you&#8230;, very much&#8230;.”</p>



<p>If he could see me, tears were flooding down my face.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t bear the emotions that welled up in me, and I hugged the hydrangea blossom to my chest.</p>



<p>Why?&nbsp; Was I relieved?&nbsp; As if a tight plug had come out, no matter how much I wiped my eyes, a terrifying number of tears flooded out.</p>



<p><em>Drip drip, drip drip</em>.&nbsp; The hydrangea blossom seemed to be hit by rain.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry.”</p>



<p>“No, I don&#8217;t mind.&nbsp; Please feel free to cry a lot.”</p>



<p>For quite some time, the tears would not stop, and I apologized to Fumiya while continuing to cry.&nbsp; He quietly held out a handkerchief and waited for me to calm down.</p>



<p>Beyond that, he did not touch or console me.</p>



<p>In the midst of the rustling bamboo forest, and the mild wind like the touch of coming summer.</p>
