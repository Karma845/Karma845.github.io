<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Other Side – Fumiya: Congratulations on a Marriage You Cannot Escape</h2>



<p>My name is Fumiya Minazuki.</p>



<p>I am a descendant of the celestial maiden, I am the Head of House Minazuki’s main family.</p>



<p>– Be honest.&nbsp; Be strong.</p>



<p>These were the words Father always spoke to me.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>On the day that I met Rikka, she seemed completely like a withered flower that had not received enough water.</p>



<p>By water, I meant love.</p>



<p>She had very much not received enough of it.&nbsp; She was withered, to a pitiable degree.</p>



<span id="more-240"></span>



<p>“Isn’t that a good thing, Bon?&nbsp; Rikka accepted the betrothal without issues,” Koutarou said to me that night, lighting a cigarette.&nbsp; “Please finish up the rest cleanly.&nbsp; Watering flowers is your strong suit.&nbsp; Especially reviving the withered ones.”</p>



<p>“Rikka isn’t a flower.&nbsp; She’s a human.”</p>



<p>I’d brought up the matter of the betrothal prepared for her to hate it so much that she would detest me, weep, and reject me.</p>



<p>However, Rikka had spoken words that were the polar opposite of what I expected.</p>



<p>She was undeserving, she had said.</p>



<p>Of this marriage that she could not escape.</p>



<p>“Since you have to get married at some point, it’s best if she doesn’t hate you.&nbsp; You don’t want to force it, right?&nbsp; Well, that’s common among the Minazuki, but it’s just that being husband and wife in name only is empty.”</p>



<p>“Wrong.”</p>



<p>I cut him off in a low, dull voice.</p>



<p>“Rikka had no other recourse but to rely on me.&nbsp; The outer moat had already been filled in.&nbsp; That’s all there was to it.”</p>



<p>I had driven her into that kind of corner, I had taken advantage of her loneliness and illness, and I had invited her to join the main family.</p>



<p>Before she healed from the wound dealt by her mother’s lack of love, her beloved father had died.&nbsp; She had sunk into an abyss of despair.&nbsp; All I had done was show up at the right moment&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Still, well, that girl’s pretty depressed, Bon.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;What are you trying to say, Koutarou.”</p>



<p>“No, nothing.&nbsp; I’m just saying that if she didn’t receive enough parental love, and a weirdo like you appears, then she’ll become dependent on you.”</p>



<p>Koutarou tapped the ash from the cigarette he was smoking into an ashtray.</p>



<p>As the smoke from his cigarette curled lazily around me, I could do nothing but narrow my eyes.&nbsp; “&#8230;That is what I want.&nbsp; I will accept everything about her.”</p>



<p>Rikka didn’t know.</p>



<p><em>The true meaning concealed beneath my marriage to you.</em></p>



<p>The meaning of the prophecy pronounced fifteen years earlier.</p>



<p>“Well, so long as you’re prepared, Bon, it’ll be all right.”&nbsp; Koutarou rose, and after standing on the veranda and puffing out cigarette smoke, he said, “The trigger for the Moon’s Return Disease is despair.”</p>



<p>Gazing up at that night’s crescent moon, he murmured in an ironical voice, “Bon, even if you despair, you won’t give up.&nbsp; Even if she causes you to despair, you won’t give up.&nbsp; Going forward, no matter what happens to you&#8230;at least, not until the birth of the prophesied ‘child of the two of you’.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“The main family, with its legitimate heir.&nbsp; The cadet branches and the others must not wrest away the celestial maiden’s robe of feathers.”</p>



<p>I glared at Koutarou.</p>



<p>However, he merely turned with a provoking smile on his lips.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>In the Minazuki family, there was an influential figure called Lady Takudaiin who possessed the power of “Prophecy.”</p>



<p>Lady Takudaiin was blind, and had also been the second wife of my predecessor, the Head Izayoi Minazuki, but she had been divorced for several years and had renounced the world to become a Buddhist nun.</p>



<p>Even though she possessed the power of Prophecy, she could not foresee whatever she wished.</p>



<p>However, she was a critical compass for the Minazuki family, and even that cursed demonic gramps of mine had held her in high regard.</p>



<p>One time, Izayoi had taken me to pay a visit to Lady Takudaiin, and she had granted me a prophecy.</p>



<p>“The wife of Fumiya Minazuki shall be Rikka Minazuki – &#8220;</p>



<p>The power of Lady Takudaiin’s prophecy had exposed Rikka’s existence.</p>



<p>It was the existence of a girl who’d inherited the bloodline of the main family, about whom no one in House Minazuki had known, ever since Mr. Rikuzou left the family.</p>



<p>“Rikuzou’s daughter ‘Rikka’ is the eldest female child of the main family that we have not seen in three hundred years.&nbsp; Rikka and Fumiya’s child will restore the main family to how it should be, and bring to fruition Minazuki prosperity and the wish we have cherished for a thousand years.”</p>



<p>Upon learning of Rikka’s existence, Izayoi had wept from joy at this prophecy.</p>



<p>“Ohh, ohh!&nbsp; What can I say!&nbsp; The long-awaited girl, as the eldest child of the main family!”</p>



<p>Then, gripping my shoulder hard, he spoke these words:</p>



<p>“You must marry ‘Rikka’ and have a child, Fumiya.&nbsp; That is the only purpose for which you were born!”</p>



<p>At the time, I was only three years old.</p>



<p>Although I didn’t understand a word of what he’d said, I remembered being pretty scared of my great-grandfather’s glittering eyes, and the tears that streamed down his face.</p>



<p>Izayoi must have planned everything from that moment on.</p>



<p>Before his death, he <em>concealed the celestial maiden’s robe of feathers somewhere in this world</em>.</p>



<p>Then, in his will, he’d written that whichever Minazuki found the celestial maiden’s robe of feathers would inherit it.</p>



<p>I had no idea what Izayoi’s true motive for doing such a thing was.</p>



<p>The celestial maiden’s robe of feathers.</p>



<p>It was the proof that we were the descendants who had inherited the celestial maiden’s blood, the symbol of our authority.</p>



<p>It reigned supreme over our legacy from the Moon, the key to unlocking the entrance to the Lunar World –</p>



<p>House Minazuki’s deeply-cherished wish was instinctively “returning to the Moon.”&nbsp; While we didn’t know if that were possible in reality, everyone in the family wanted the celestial maiden’s robe of feathers, which might hold that initiative.</p>



<p>The inheritance fight, in which blood washed blood away, had begun when Rikka’s existence was exposed.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>The girl named Rikka Minazuki.</p>



<p>The daughter of Rikuzou Minazuki – who, even in House Minazuki, had held divine powers of long-awaited strength.</p>



<p>After I was blessed, so to speak, with the prophecy, the training and education that Izayoi was forcing on me stepped up in harshness and pain.&nbsp; And, all the time, he was telling me:</p>



<p>– You exist for Rikka.</p>



<p>– That is the one and only reason you were born.</p>



<p>After that, I kept wondering why I felt so bitter, and whether House Minazuki’s customs and destiny needed to be transmitted to posterity.</p>



<p>As I endured the education for becoming the next Head of House, which was akin to abuse, I wondered.</p>



<p>My parents, whom Izayoi had used continually, whose lives had been worn down.</p>



<p>How I could save my little brother and sister, who met with an outrageous fate because of our parents’ abilities.</p>



<p>Because that man, Rikuzou Minazuki, who’d been the original heir to the main family, had thrown away his own mission and lived for the sake of love, my family had met with such a fate.</p>



<p>Despite that, I was going to have to marry his daughter.</p>



<p>The girl named Rikka was leading a carefree, unfettered life somewhere in this world, without knowing a thing about her father’s sins or our suffering or anything at all.</p>



<p>But, on the other hand, the existence of the girl I was prophesied to marry in the future also provided me with a ray of hope.</p>



<p>Jealousy, and admiration.</p>



<p>Hatred, and yearning.</p>



<p>Those opposing, complicated emotions tormented me.</p>



<p>Little by little, I came to want to meet my prophesied bride, Rikka Minazuki.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Mr. Rikuzou’s visit to the main family came after my great-grandfather Izayoi Minazuki had passed away.</p>



<p>Even as he somehow suspected that Izayoi had died, Mr. Rikuzou had read the will that Izayoi had left at the last and, half in a daze, paid his respects at the family altar.</p>



<p>He had developed the Moon’s Return Disease.</p>



<p>It was fairly advanced, so much so that not even the main family could do anything for him.</p>



<p>Although Mr. Rikuzou was already prepared to die, he was worried and anxious about the daughter he would leave behind, he said, and he wept.&nbsp; Then he said that he wished to entrust Rikka to my care.</p>



<p>The reason was simple.&nbsp; In the end, for those who inherited the blood of the Minazuki, the thicker that blood was, the stronger their powers, and they could only survive among the Minazuki.</p>



<p><em>How convenient</em>, I thought.&nbsp; He’d lived as he pleased, made enemies of anyone and everyone, and left the main family, and yet now here he was, bowing his head before me and saying that he wished to entrust his daughter to my care.</p>



<p>On top of that, he told me, the woman whom he loved, for whom he had thrown away his entire family, had been unable to accept the unique constitution of the daughter she had borne, and had violently rejected Rikka.&nbsp; He couldn’t comprehend why he loved that sort of woman, Mr. Rikuzou told me.</p>



<p>All the same, his wife had been a kind and wonderful woman, he said.</p>



<p>It was his own and House Minazuki’s blood that had caused her to make such an about-face, he said.</p>



<p>Well, whatever.&nbsp; That sort of thing had nothing to do with me.</p>



<p>At that time, for my own sake, I had made a certain suggestion.</p>



<p>If he allowed a betrothal between Rikka and myself, then I would undertake his proposal, I announced.</p>



<p>Although Mr. Rikuzou was startled, he did understand my reason for wanting Rikka.</p>



<p>“Please swear that you <em>will</em> make Rikka happy.”</p>



<p>That was what Mr. Rikuzou said.&nbsp; Even as he agonized over it, and added the condition that I should wait until Rikka turned sixteen, he accepted it.</p>



<p>He himself had fled from here, and yet, he was imprisoning his daughter here&#8230;?</p>



<p>However, from the first, it had been prophesied.&nbsp; That this should happen had been decided by the Moon’s guidance.</p>



<p>“This is my daughter Rikka.”</p>



<p>So saying, Mr. Rikuzou handed me a photo of Rikka.</p>



<p>My first sight of my betrothed.</p>



<p>The Rikka in the photo had beautiful hair as black as lacquer, and cheeks tinged with color.</p>



<p>Her small, fine, red lips traced an arc, her eyes were slightly narrowed, and she was smiling a faintly lonely smile.</p>



<p>The instant I saw this photo, I grew a little teary.</p>



<p>A pain shot through my chest at the sight of an ordinary girl who had absolutely nothing to do with the Minazuki.</p>



<p>Was I trying to entangle and use this girl in the treacherous battles of the Minazuki?</p>



<p>However, someday, we had to marry.</p>



<p>The prophecy was absolute.&nbsp; Because of that, I had to do it.</p>



<p>So then, someday, will you direct this smile at me?</p>



<p>Someday, will you save me from these troubles?</p>



<p>Even knowing the truth, will you stay by my side without hating me?</p>



<p>Will you make it so that I will no longer be alone – ?</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Congratulations on a marriage you cannot escape.</p>



<p>As for what I can do: only to make a family for you, a place where you belong, where you will not be lonely, inside this insect cage called Minazuki.</p>



<p>Only to collect small joys, like snow accumulating on the ground.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>For so long now, I have been awaiting the day you can come to me.</p>
