<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 4: The Sister-in-Law Appears</h2>



<p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>Restraining the beautiful, immature young woman’s head, Fumiya apologized deeply to me.</p>



<p>“This is my little sister, Umi.&nbsp; She will be a second-year in middle school.&nbsp; As you can see, you can say that she has a bit of a violent temper, or that she forgets herself when she gets hungry, and she attacks people.”</p>



<p>“Fumi!&nbsp; I’m hungry!&nbsp; Lemme eat curry!”</p>



<p>“Because no matter how much time passed, you wouldn’t come out of the storehouse!&nbsp; You were probably just playing games, of course.”</p>



<p>“I couldn’t help it.&nbsp; I was playing a new event!”</p>



<p>Even with her bloodshot eyes, her chapped lips, and her hair and even her kimono in disarray, the girl named Umi was still far and away the most beautiful young woman.&nbsp; It was just that, with the atmosphere in this house, it felt as if a specter had taken that form and popped out all of a sudden.&nbsp; My heart was still thumping.</p>



<p>Long, wavy, white hair and pale skin and eyes.</p>



<p>Her elusive, Floating World aura was a little similar to that of her older brother Fumiya’s.</p>



<p>However, her temperament was similar, yet not similar, to Fumiya’s, like violent, raging waves.</p>



<span id="more-98"></span>



<p>“Umi.&nbsp; This young lady is Rikka Minazuki.&nbsp; Starting yesterday, she is honoring us by living in this house.”</p>



<p>“C’mon.&nbsp; I know everything.&nbsp; I saw it the moment she entered the Minazuki premises.”</p>



<p>“In that case, please greet her.”</p>



<p>Umi stood with her feet planted wide and her arms folded and looked me up and down as if she were licking me.</p>



<p>“Hmph.&nbsp; So, <em>you’re</em> Fumi’s bride.”</p>



<p>“B–bride?”</p>



<p>“I am Umi Minazuki.&nbsp; In point of fact, I am your sister-in-law, but I don’t particularly care who Fumi marries, so just don’t get in the way of my amusements.&nbsp; Under those circumstances, see here, get some curry ready for me right now.&nbsp; A super-sized serving!”</p>



<p>“Stop that, Umi!&nbsp; Get it yourself!”</p>



<p>“Shut up, baldy Fumi.”</p>



<p>Umi spat abuses at her older brother Fumiya, dropped down at the low table in the sitting room next door, and banged on the tabletop.&nbsp; It was my cue to bring her curry fast.</p>



<p>“I understand.&nbsp; The curry is done right now, so I’ll prepare some for you at once!”</p>



<p>I was at the service of my sister-in-law Umi.&nbsp; I served curry rice onto a plate and carried it into the sitting room.&nbsp; Looking apologetic, Fumiya helped me.</p>



<p>“This is tuna-and-tomato curry.&nbsp; With a helping of boiled egg and deep-fried summer vegetables.”</p>



<p>“Huh?&nbsp; What the heck is that.&nbsp; But it does smell good – “</p>



<p>A large serving of brightly-colored curry rice topped with half of a boiled egg and summer vegetables.</p>



<p>I put that before her eyes, and with a “Wait,” Umi flew at it like an unleashed dog.&nbsp; She wolfed it down.&nbsp; She’d already finished wolfing it down.</p>



<p>I was stunned that she could be that hungry.</p>



<p>However, as the one who’d made it, I was glad at her way of eating.</p>



<p>“Stop that, Umi, eat properly!&nbsp; How old are you!”</p>



<p>“I’m a second-year middle school student.&nbsp; Even if I’m our current home security guard.”</p>



<p>“Don’t talk so big&#8230;!&nbsp; Well, ahh, don’t complain.&nbsp; Who do you think got the stains out of that yukata!”</p>



<p>“You did, idiot.&nbsp; Ah, seconds.&nbsp; This is delicious.”</p>



<p>Indifferent to Fumiya’s anxiety, Umi energetically finished eating and requested seconds.&nbsp; Then she devoured the second plate of curry too.&nbsp; Fumiya buried his face in his hands.</p>



<p>“Umi&#8230;.&nbsp; It looks like Umi shut herself up in the storehouse next to the main building the entire time I was away.&nbsp; She carried in large amounts of instant noodles and water and a teakettle, and used guarding the house as an excuse to ditch school, even.&nbsp; Probably when her food ran out and she remembered that she was hungry, she finally came out of the storehouse.&nbsp; That must have been it&#8230;,” Fumiya lamented, and at last, he took a bite of the curry set before him.</p>



<p>After he ate it, his expression changed slightly.&nbsp; His eyes widened, I could say?</p>



<p>“You made this from the ingredients in our house?&nbsp; With the rich flavor from the tomatoes and onions, it’s completely like genuine curry that you eat in restaurants.”</p>



<p>“Even without store-bought curry roux cubes, as long as you have curry powder and onions and tomatoes, you can make curry.&nbsp; I also borrowed a bit of yogurt.&nbsp; I think it would taste more like curry if there were chicken or pork, but tuna doesn’t have much taste of its own and is handy for absorbing flavors.”</p>



<p>And the roux was simple, so for this reason, the summer vegetables I’d added to the curry stood out.&nbsp; You could fully taste the flavors and sweetness too of the deep-fried vegetables.</p>



<p>“Rikka, you know a lot about curry.&nbsp; Do you make it often?”</p>



<p>“My father&#8230;loved curry.”</p>



<p>I answered while fidgeting.&nbsp; Fumiya went back to praising the curry.</p>



<p>“It is delicious.&nbsp; Very much so.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Tha-thank you very much.”</p>



<p>It wasn’t a big deal, but I was honestly glad that someone said a dish that I’d made often for my father tasted good.</p>



<p>Even Fumiya’s manner of eating was beautifully refined, but for such a slender body, he ate a lot more than I’d expected.&nbsp; Perhaps he was hungry from working since the morning.&nbsp; Umi, despite being so petite, ate a third generous helping.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, Dad had also been a big eater.&nbsp; I, too, got hungry at once with normal portions.</p>



<p>Could it be that House Minazuki was a line of big eaters&#8230;?&nbsp; I wondered if it were related to the celestial maiden’s blood.</p>



<p>“Thanks for the food!”</p>



<p>After eating intently in silence, Umi clapped her hands in a satisfied way and stood up with vigor.</p>



<p>Then she looked down at me.&nbsp; I’d slipped to the opposite side of the low table and begun to eat curry.&nbsp; She pointed a finger at me.</p>



<p>“Oy, you, older brother’s wife.”</p>



<p>“Ye–yes!”</p>



<p>“After this, go buy popsicles and potato chips and cola at the convenience store.&nbsp; For the popsicles, Gari Gari Kun’s soda flavor, and for the potato chips, wasabi mayonnaise flavor.&nbsp; Then bring them to my storehouse.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“Umi!&nbsp; That’s rude, don’t treat Rikka like a lowly servant!”</p>



<p>“Go to hell, Fumi.”</p>



<p>Even though Fumiya scolded her over and over, Umi didn’t listen to a word her older brother said and pounded out of the sitting room.&nbsp; A hush fell over the room.</p>



<p>“Ah, that felt like a storm.”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Rikka&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Looking distressed, Fumiya apologized.</p>



<p>“Even if she is my youngest sister, she’s just spoiled&#8230;, and as you’ve noticed, she’s become a shamelessly rude person.&nbsp; However, I think that summoning you to her storehouse is proof that she has acknowledged and accepted you as family.”</p>



<p>“Huh, really?&nbsp; Why in the world?”</p>



<p>“It’s probably because the curry was&#8230;extremely delicious&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Fumiya had a slightly distant look.</p>



<p>I–I saw.&nbsp; For the time being, thanks to the curry, I seemed to have received a passing grade&#8230;.</p>



<p>“As a matter of fact, it’s thanks to Umi that the vast premises of our home can be managed safely.”</p>



<p>“Huh&#8230;?”</p>



<p>When Fumiya stood up, he extended a hand towards the household altar in a high spot in the sitting room.</p>



<p>I hadn’t noticed it before now, but small, misshapen stone figurines were enshrined at the end of the altar.</p>



<p>They might be patron deities two heads tall, or they might be stone snowmen.</p>



<p>“Sometimes I see these scattered around the garden.”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; Earlier, Umi referred to herself as a ‘home security guard.’&nbsp; In fact, that is what she does.&nbsp; The one who extends a large-scale barrier around the premises of the Minazuki main home, who constantly watches for whether there are invading curses and trespassers, who takes defensive precautions – is my little sister, Umi.”</p>



<p>Fumiya picked up a stone figurine and had me look at it very closely.</p>



<p>“These stone figurines are called ‘Moon Arhat Images’ and form the eyes of the barrier.&nbsp; They are stationed here and there throughout the premises.&nbsp; If danger approaches, Umi perceives it at once through the stone figurines.”</p>



<p>“Amazing&#8230;, Umi can handle such amazing work?!”</p>



<p>“That is Umi’s supernatural ability.&nbsp; For the Minazuki, the ‘barrier’ supernatural ability is also very convenient.”</p>



<p>So, in the end, it was completely magical.&nbsp; However, for a Minazuki, even having the kind of ability that set you apart from humans probably wasn’t strange.</p>



<p>“Even so, I’ll go to the convenience store myself.&nbsp; Please take a slow day, Rikka.”</p>



<p>“N–no!&nbsp; I was just thinking that I wanted to go shopping.”</p>



<p>“But.”</p>



<p>“Well, may I follow you?&nbsp; I’d like to learn about this neighborhood.”</p>



<p>I wanted to get a sense of where the closest convenience store and supermarket, and the shops I would visit routinely were located.</p>



<p>Fumiya rubbed his chin, considered it for a moment, and nodded his comprehension.</p>



<p>However, as soon as I took one step outside the premises of House Minazuki, I realized why Fumiya looked so terribly worried.</p>

<p>Even though I was walking in the busy Saga Arashiyama tourist district.</p>



<p>“Aaaah~, argh!”</p>



<p>“Ca–calm down, please, Rikka!”</p>



<p>Wherever I looked, there were things that weren’t human.</p>



<p>Each time I ran into one of them, I screamed as if the air were yanked out of me, shook uncontrollably, and clung to Fumiya’s wrist.&nbsp; Afterwards, when I noticed that, my face would go crimson, and the outcome was that I’d leap away from him in a panic.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry!”</p>



<p>This had repeated about ten times already.</p>



<p>Even though all we were doing was going to the convenience store for some shopping.</p>



<span id="more-111"></span>



<p>“No, it’s fine.&nbsp; I’m surprised, after all.&nbsp; It seems that Mr. Rikuzou chose to live in an area with few ayakashi and yokai, but Kyoto is an area with so many of these beings that it’s called the Spirit Capital.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I–is that so.”</p>



<p>Sobbing, I secretly gave up.</p>



<p>I was too jittery.&nbsp; Too shameful.</p>



<p>Before this point, I had seen ayakashi, specters, and yokai types.&nbsp; However, as Fumiya had said, my father had lived in such a way as to avoid them, and I had only seen them circling at a distance.&nbsp; Certainly not like this, with beings that were not human existing in the middle of the street in Arashiyama.</p>



<p>Although there were beings that normal humans could not see, there were also ones that took human form and mingled with the humans, sightseeing normally.&nbsp; Shapeshifting cats, long-necked demons, foxes, tanuki, tengu, human ghosts&#8230;.</p>



<p>“I was raised here, so I don’t think much of it.&nbsp; I think you’ll get used to it gradually too.&nbsp; In most cases, they do not harm humans.”</p>



<p>“They don’t?”</p>



<p>“From ancient times, each area in Kyoto has been the sphere of influence of a great yokai, who commands the low- and mid-level yokai.&nbsp; There are also many humans who watch over them and maintain order between humans and beings who are not human.&nbsp; Among the customers of the ‘lunar resources’ that House Minazuki monopolizes, there are many of this sort of people, who are on the side of humans, who are opponents of the yokai.&nbsp; &#8230;Rather, the ‘human’ side may be the scary one.”</p>



<p>Fumiya stopped in the middle of Arashiyama’s famous Togetsuki, or “Crossing Moon,” Bridge.</p>



<p>Then he gazed at the beautiful Katsura River, against a backdrop of the magnificent mountains that were also famous for their autumn foliage.</p>



<p>I, too, followed his gaze.</p>



<p>Ah, playing on the riverbank were innocent tsukimari kappa.&nbsp; Those little tsukimari kappa conveyed a sense of harmlessness and weren’t scary&#8230;.</p>



<p>“How did Mr. Rikuzou teach you to deal with these sorts of spirits of the mountains, forests, and rivers?”</p>



<p>“Huh?&nbsp; Um&#8230;he said, as much as possible, don’t meet their eyes, don’t talk to them.&nbsp; He said, if I saw them, put distance between us.”</p>



<p>While recalling what my father had told me, I touched my ears.</p>



<p>“However, my ears can’t help but pick up ‘voices.’&nbsp; Occasionally, they’d pick up&#8230;strange voices that not even my father could hear.”</p>



<p>Often, I had no idea whose voices those were.</p>



<p>Although those voices did sometimes comfort and help me, they also frequently deceived me.</p>



<p>Fumiya narrowed his eyes and seemed to be considering something&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Ah, I apologize.&nbsp; I’ve made you walk quite a bit.&nbsp; It would be convenient if we had a car, but Koutarou is not here today.”</p>



<p>“No, it’s all right.&nbsp; I enjoy walking.&nbsp; Besides&#8230;I can also go around, looking at the streets of Arashiyama and Sagano.”</p>



<p>I spoke haltingly.&nbsp; Then, I glanced by accident at Fumiya, who was next to me.</p>



<p>Fumiya had left the residence in Japanese clothing, but here and there among the tourists were also people in kimonos, so people weren’t paying that much attention to us.&nbsp; Rather, he melted naturally into the scene, and the kimono fit him better than anyone else.&nbsp; Even if he were holding a reusable shopping bag in one hand.</p>



<p>“Next month, I will turn eighteen, and I intend to acquire a regular driver’s license, so I think it will end the inconvenience to you.”</p>



<p>“What, a driver’s license already?!&nbsp; So fast!”</p>



<p>Naturally, I was shocked at that.&nbsp; Fumiya said that he’d already gone through a driving school.</p>



<p>“This neighborhood is just a tourist area and public transportation isn’t so inconvenient, but a car will be necessary for the family business no matter what.&nbsp; The house is so deep in the mountains, and there aren’t any adults at home.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>There weren’t any adults.&nbsp; When he said it once more, it was true, for sure.</p>



<p>The main family was a family of only Fumiya, and You and Umi.&nbsp; Although the cadet branches probably had adults such as Koutarou, there were only children in the main family.&nbsp; I, whom they’d be taking care of from now on, was also a child.</p>



<p>Therefore, Fumiya looked so mature, right?</p>



<p>He himself must have believed that he had to grow up fast&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Fumiya, you are amazing after all.”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“Ever since I’ve seen your work, I’ve been thinking that.&nbsp; Even though you just said that all you did was take over the family business, that’s also amazing&#8230;.amazing and such hard work.”</p>



<p>Even though I was looking down, I tried to convey something with my words.</p>



<p>The first time I’d met Fumiya, I’d thought of him as the handsome young Head of a prestigious family, a boy who was different from me and who seemed to have everything.</p>



<p>He was mature in both expression and tone, he was calm, he seemed to handle any situation with ease, he had no chinks in his armor.</p>



<p>He appeared cold, and in the beginning, I’d even thought he was a little frightening.</p>



<p>However, I thought that even in his dispassionate words, there seemed to be a human warmth and a mysterious strength.&nbsp; I felt that he was teaching me one truth after another with sincerity.</p>



<p>In the course of watching him work in the fields, sharing close moments with his family, being admired by the tsukimari kappa, I’d changed my mind.&nbsp; It was likely that he was someone who worked very hard because he was the Head of the main family.</p>



<p>Only, one thing bothered me.&nbsp; What drove him to work this hard?</p>



<p>The immense pressure of being the main family was something whose true nature I couldn’t comprehend, but I couldn’t help but sense that it clung to Fumiya and that family.</p>



<p>“There’s still so much I don’t understand, but&#8230;when I look at you, I think that you must be trying your best.&nbsp; Trying to perform unreasonable tasks and all, never with any ill intent.&nbsp; You’re just moving forward, keeping your chin up, learning things one at a time while living your life&#8230;I think.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Rikka.”</p>



<p>Past wounds and loneliness couldn’t be healed at once either.</p>



<p>Occasionally, I, too, remembered moments when I felt despair.</p>



<p>I wanted to stop existing in a state where I didn’t do anything, where I simply lost the will to live.</p>



<p>It was Fumiya who’d made me think that.</p>



<p>Although not many days had passed since I met him, I had something to which I was strongly attracted, after all.&nbsp; Someone who gave to others the hope for living, someone who gave to me the words for which I longed.</p>



<p>Although our relationship as betrothed did not yet feel real, it was impossible not to think of him as an amazing human being.</p>



<p>“E–excuse me!&nbsp; This, I, for acting like I know it all&#8230;.&nbsp; However, I do feel truly grateful to you for helping me, for teaching me all sorts of things&#8230;.”</p>



<p>As I spoke, I pressed my hands to my cheeks, my face went crimson, and I hung my head even more.</p>



<p>Somehow.&nbsp; Even though it would be better if I could convey my feelings more skillfully.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Not at all.&nbsp; I did not think that you would say that to me.”</p>



<p>Only, Fumiya also averted his gaze and looked to the side, and muttered a few words sounding slightly embarrassed.</p>



<p>“Thank you very much.&nbsp; This feels a little rewarding.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>We returned to the main family’s residence, and I took the things that Umi had entrusted to me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because I thought that I needed to greet Umi properly once more, I wanted to try talking to her with just the two of us.&nbsp; Even though Fumiya looked intensely concerned.</p>



<p>A deep breath.&nbsp; Then I knocked on the door of the place where Umi had shut herself up, a storehouse with thick mortar walls adjoining the main house.&nbsp; When I did so, the door opened on its own.</p>



<p>“Welcome to my hideout.&nbsp; Did you bring the things I asked for?”</p>



<p>Umi removed her headphones and put them around her neck, spun in her chair, and faced me.&nbsp; Using her telekinetic power, she pulled the popsicles and all that I was holding in my hands to herself.</p>



<p>“Take off your shoes and come up.&nbsp; You sit somewhere too.”</p>



<p>“Ye–yes.”</p>



<p>But where should I sit?</p>



<p>The inside of the storehouse was different from what I’d pictured.&nbsp; It had been remodeled into a comfortable room with a wooden floor, and it had air conditioning too, but things were strewn all over the place.</p>



<p>Homemade stone figurines used for the barrier, and mysterious tools too were scattered everywhere, and there was nowhere to walk.&nbsp; There was a&nbsp; low table in the middle, buried under things, and I found space for one person to sit next to it and sat down quietly.</p>



<p>I realized that rattling sounds were coming from somewhere.&nbsp; There was something on a shelf in a corner of the room.</p>



<p>Ah, it was a hamster.&nbsp; A winter white dwarf hamster was running frantically in a wheel in its cage&#8230;.</p>



<p>As for Umi, she peeled the wrapper off a soda-flavored popsicle I’d bought and bit into it.</p>



<p>In front of the chair in which she sat were several large computer screens and monitors.&nbsp; They were glowing rectangles.&nbsp; It looked like she sat in this chair and played games.&nbsp; I wondered if it was an online game.</p>



<p>A stuffy, windowless, un-girlish room&#8230;.or rather, storehouse.</p>



<p>“Right now, you’re probably thinking it’s a dirty storehouse and such.”</p>



<p>“No, not at all!”</p>



<p>With a dubious expression, Umi tore open a bag of potato chips.&nbsp; Then, making full use of her telekinesis, she set a cup right before me.&nbsp; A small refrigerator in a corner of the room opened on its own, and cold ice tea came out and flowed into the cup before me.</p>



<p>“Telekinesis really is convenient,” I said.</p>



<p>“Well.&nbsp; For a shut-in like me, it’s the best ability.&nbsp; Speaking of that, you can probably use it.&nbsp; You’re a Minazuki.”</p>



<p>I shook my head hard.&nbsp; Even though my father could use it, I didn’t have that ability.</p>



<p>Umi got more and more suspicious.&nbsp; Still looking dubious, she said, “You can drink that,” so I gratefully drank it.&nbsp; Actually, I was thirsty, so I was glad.&nbsp; Delicious.</p>



<p>“Rikka, is it?&nbsp; How old?&nbsp; What year?”</p>



<p>“I am sixteen years old.&nbsp; I am a first-year high school student.”</p>



<p>“Huh –.&nbsp; Two years younger than Fumi&#8230;?&nbsp; Speaking of that, for that age, you took the matter of the betrothal well.&nbsp; If you suddenly told a high school girl raised on the outside about a betrothal and all that, normally she’d hate it.&nbsp; You don’t think it’s gross, and yucky, and the like?&nbsp; Or why?&nbsp; Do you like Fumi’s face or something?”</p>



<p>“Uh.”</p>



<p>Tha–that was&#8230;.</p>



<p>That was, I did think that his clear, bright eyes and his regular features were wonderful, but&#8230;.</p>



<p>When I hesitated, Umi abused him with an “Ugh.”</p>



<p>“You should give up.&nbsp; Sure, his face isn’t bad, but that guy is a hotblooded character who puts on a show of coolness.&nbsp; He’s damn serious, he nags, he doesn’t smile.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;By chance, are you sad that your older brother is going to get married?”</p>



<p>“Whaaaaa?!&nbsp; Not at all, that’d make me the little-sister character in a light novel!”</p>



<p>The veins were popping out on Umi’s forehead, and she pounded the desk indignantly.</p>



<p>“Our whole family isn’t normal, you know.&nbsp; A betrothed is selected for us from the time we’re very young, so it’s natural to have a betrothed.&nbsp; I’m like that too.&nbsp; Even though I utterly detest him!”</p>



<p>“What?&nbsp; You have a betrothed too?!&nbsp; Then, You as well?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;No, not You.”</p>



<p>What?&nbsp; Why didn’t You have a betrothed?</p>



<p>As I tipped my head to a side, thinking it was strange, Umi flung the popsicle stick she was done with into a faraway trashcan.</p>



<p>“But you, do you know exactly why Fumi is marrying you?&nbsp; Because what the main family needs most is your and Fumi’s <em>children</em>.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Returning the legitimate blood to the main family – that’s what it’s about.”</p>



<p>I was informed of the hard facts of the situation point-blank by a younger, fourteen-year-old girl.</p>



<p>“Is that&#8230;so.&nbsp; I – that situation doesn’t yet – feel real, I think.”</p>



<p>Right now, I just wanted to know.&nbsp; What kind of person was Fumiya?</p>



<p>What kind of family was House Minazuki, which my father had hated?</p>



<p>Whatever form it took, if there were a place where I believed that I could live, and people who needed me, then I&#8230;.</p>



<p>Umi cast a glance in my direction and then heaved a long sigh.</p>



<p>“I worry that someone like you won’t be able to handle the toxicity of House Minazuki.&nbsp; From looking at you, you give me an ephemeral feeling, and you seem timid. &nbsp;In the cadet branches, there are swarms of anachronistically ill-natured relatives.&nbsp; They’ll apply every pressure, and a bride of the main family who can’t endure that will be destroyed.”</p>



<p>“Umi&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“Because&#8230;there’s something pitiful about you.”</p>



<p>Her tone was certainly rude, but I realized that she was teaching me things that Fumiya could not speak of readily.</p>



<p>“Umi, you’re worried about me.&nbsp; I really appreciate it.”</p>



<p>“Yo–you’re wrong!&nbsp; Though, no, you’re not wrong!”</p>



<p>Umi’s face went crimson, and she pounded her desk again.</p>



<p>However, as opposed to my strong first impression of her, Umi was actually kind and sincere.</p>



<p>I had the sense that, in that way, she was a little similar to Fumiya after all.&nbsp; They were siblings&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Ahem.”</p>



<p>Umi coughed, as if to recover herself.</p>



<p>“Now for advice from your sister-in-law for surviving in House Minazuki.&nbsp; My favorite foods are curry and popsicles and pancakes.&nbsp; If you want to get on my good side, make no mistake about presenting me with those.&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; For the rest, if you seriously plan to marry into this family, you should start wearing kimonos.”</p>



<p>“Huh?&nbsp; Kimonos?”</p>



<p>“In our family, kimonos are standard, so if you don’t want the cadet branches to look down on you, say nasty things about you, and mock you, you should get used to wearing them.&nbsp; Every fall, all the relatives get together for an incomprehensible gathering, but there’s probably enough time before then.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Doubtless I was turning pale.&nbsp; Wobble, wobble.&nbsp; There was no mistaking that I was trembling noticeably.</p>



<p>For sure, among the supplies I had received had been a Japanese chest of drawers with beautiful kimonos stored in it.</p>



<p>Firstly because I didn’t know how to put them on, and I couldn’t imagine myself wearing them, I’d left them there.&nbsp; However, marrying into the Minazuki main family meant wearing those kimonos with skill.</p>



<p>When I was at a loss for words, Umi came up next to me, hugging a game console-like object for some reason, and clapped me on the shoulder.</p>



<p>“Come on, come on, don’t be that scared, it’ll be okay.&nbsp; As your sister-in-law, I’ll teach you how to get dressed.&nbsp; That is, soon, without mercy!&nbsp; Oh, but Fumi’s also good at helping people put on women’s kimonos.&nbsp; How about having him help you every time?”</p>



<p>“N–no&#8230;.&nbsp; Please teach me.&nbsp; Next time, definitely, please teach me how to put them on!”</p>



<p>I made a vow.</p>



<p>That I would master things in this family, starting with how to wear a kimono in this house.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>About an hour after that.</p>



<p>Fumiya got pretty worried that I wasn’t returning from Umi’s storehouse and came to see how I was doing, but&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Da–dammit.&nbsp; Why, why!&nbsp; I was going to tease and beat the new bride who came to our home at my style of game&#8230;, but why am I getting viciously murdered!”</p>



<p>Umi dropped to her hands and knees and pounded the floor, severely humiliated.</p>



<p>“Umi, are you worse than you expected?” I asked.</p>



<p>“Da–damn it~, ogre bride~, what kind of cruel skill~~!”</p>



<p>Since Umi had told me that as House Minazuki’s bride, I had to play a game against my sister-in-law, and so on, we were having fun playing a “fighting game where national characters assembled and waged war.”&nbsp; Then I won against Umi three times in a row.</p>



<p>At the sight, Fumiya was struck dumb for a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s amazing, Rikka.&nbsp; You beat Umi, who’s been playing games forever.”</p>



<p>“Uh!&nbsp; Oh, that.&nbsp; It’s probably my father’s influence.&nbsp; He loved games, so sometimes he’d have me play against him&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Self-consciously, I scratched my cheek.&nbsp; In fact, since a long time ago, my father and I had played video games together.&nbsp; From old ones to new ones.</p>



<p>Although I myself didn’t like games to the point of obsession, somehow I’d always improved faster than my father.&nbsp; I’d thought that Dad must have been extremely bad.</p>



<p>“Huh?&nbsp; Everyone’s gathered in Umi’s dirty storehouse.&nbsp; What’re you up to?”</p>



<p>You returned from his club activities and unexpectedly peeked into the storehouse.</p>



<p>“Just now, Umi got her long tengu nose smashed by Rikka.&nbsp; She’s learned her lesson and will be a little more modest.&nbsp; After that, starting tomorrow, go to school regularly.”</p>



<p>“N-noooo.&nbsp; Biiig Brooother.”</p>



<p>“It’s too late to cling to me and act like a spoiled child.&nbsp; It’s no use whatever.”</p>



<p>Ah, Fumiya.&nbsp; Although I felt as if he were being a little malicious, he smiled slightly.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Even though he was someone who didn’t smile much, he did smile open-heartedly in front of his family after all.</p>



<p>“Oh!”</p>



<p>All of a sudden, Umi’s spiky hair stood up straight.</p>



<p>She stood up quickly and went to her desk.&nbsp; Then, with a serious expression, she began to fiddle with her computer.</p>



<p>“Fumi, You, there are trespassers on the premises.”</p>



<p>“What?!”</p>



<p>On the monitors around Umi’s desk, views of the outside appeared.&nbsp; We saw two men, carrying baskets on their backs and dressed entirely in black, sneaking around the premises for some reason.</p>



<p>“What is their goal&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“Looking like that, they’re not tourists who got lost or something.”</p>



<p>While Fumiya knit his brows and You smirked, they checked on the trespassers.</p>



<p>I, too, looked at the monitors again while holding my breath.</p>



<p>“Oh, they’re going into the flower fields.&nbsp; Flower thieves~?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Probably for the seven-star balloonflowers.&nbsp; With those, you can sell both the flowers and roots at a high price.”</p>



<p>As You and Fumiya said, the men in black pulled up the beautiful flowers that bloomed in profusion and put them into the baskets on their backs.</p>



<p>It seemed that as one type of Lunar World plant, seven-star balloonflowers were a special ingredient for medicines and could be sold for a considerable amount.&nbsp; Seven-star balloonflower root was used in the Moon’s Return Disease medicine that I took, and so on.</p>



<p>House Minazuki’s premises were a treasure house of such Lunar World resources that could be sold at high prices, and there was no end to the thieves and poachers who knew that, they told me.</p>



<p>“Humph.&nbsp; Looks like it’s time to show my true strength&#8230;!”</p>



<p>With a look unlike that of a beautiful girl, Umi took her game controller and manipulated it noisily.</p>



<p>As I wondered what she was doing, on the other side of the monitors, the mossy stone figurines that were posted on the premises began to move and chase the trespassers.</p>



<p>It was those eerie Moon Arhat images.&nbsp; This was scary.</p>



<p>“Chase them!&nbsp; Fight them!&nbsp; Only my golems will win!&nbsp; Muahahahaha.”</p>



<p>“They’re images of the Moon Arhat.&nbsp; Not golems.”</p>



<p>“Oh, not again with the tiny details, Fumi!”</p>



<p>She was manipulating her controller, managing her telekinetic ability, and moving the stone figurines through the monitors, wasn’t she?&nbsp; If so, then she was too amazing.</p>



<p>Chased, crashed into, and loomed over by the stone figurines, the trespassers crawled and turned around and fled, but it wasn’t long before they got caught in a trap set in the garden.&nbsp; They fell into a deep pit.</p>



<p>We got a close-up of their faces.&nbsp; Two middle-aged men were unconscious, foaming at the mouth.</p>



<p>“Those guys weren’t much to speak of.&nbsp; They’re probably a bunch hired for money.&nbsp; They were probably told to come steal plants from our garden.&nbsp; Anything for a profit.”</p>



<p>“Well~.&nbsp; Lately there have been a lot of those.&nbsp; They’re total idiots.&nbsp; If they’re not Minazuki, there’s no way they can do it well.”</p>



<p>Sighing with relief and shaking their heads, Fumiya and You tried to exit the storehouse.</p>



<p>“U–um, Fumiya.&nbsp; Are you going to confront them?&nbsp; Isn’t that dangerous?”</p>



<p>When I got worried and called after him, Fumiya turned back.</p>



<p>“It will be all right.&nbsp; Please stay here, Rikka.&nbsp; You’ll be safe by Umi’s side.”</p>



<p>After saying only that, he hurried away.</p>



<p>As he had said, I quietly watched over their whereabouts through the monitors, but when Fumiya and You found the trespassers who’d fallen into the pit, they didn’t touch them even a bit.&nbsp; Using telekinesis, the brothers floated them up and flung them towards the Katsura River.&nbsp; They showed no mercy&#8230;.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Thus, I finished meeting all of the noble House Minazuki siblings without issue.</p>



<p>And I was able to learn about one part of their mysterious occupation.&nbsp; And its attendant hardships too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Were the days I looked forward to a breath of wind that rang wind chimes?</p>
