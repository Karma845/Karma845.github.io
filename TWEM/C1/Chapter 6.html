<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 6: The Ghost of the Moon</h2>



<p>For several days after that, Fumiya would shut himself up in the storehouse when he got home from school, and search for some kind of information.</p>



<p>It seemed that he was double-checking the kakure kami noki trees’ distribution map and the stock of kakure paper images that were in the Minazuki’s safekeeping.&nbsp; Fumiya was trying to pinpoint the origin of the paper image and investigate the identity of the enemy who’d targeted him.</p>



<p>During that period, I went to the storehouse with Fumiya too, and opened ancient picture scrolls.</p>



<p>They were scrolls in which the origins and history of House Minazuki had been recorded.</p>



<span id="more-139"></span>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>— A thousand years ago.</p>



<p>To the north of what is now called Lake Biwa, in a location named Lake Yogo, a celestial maiden descended from the Moon.</p>



<p>Afterwards, as “the clan of Minazuki,” those who had inherited the blood of the celestial maiden made use of the resources and relics she had brought from the Moon, as well as Lunar techniques.&nbsp; They were appointed to high positions by the emperor at the time and achieved much glory.</p>



<p>In addition, the humans of House Minazuki were born bearing unique abilities and constitutions, depending on the pureness of the celestial maiden’s blood, and those were called “the divine powers of the celestial maiden.”</p>



<p>As for the powers, there were all sorts.&nbsp; Typical examples were “Telekinesis,” the ability to move objects with the thought alone, and “Demon Sight,” the ability to see things that were not human, but there were also people who had divine powers called Possession, Mind’s Eye, Prophecy, Invulnerability, Barrier, Transformation, and the like; who controlled natural forces to cause supernatural phenomena, and so on.</p>



<p>“It’s amazing, House Minazuki.”&nbsp; A sigh escaped me.&nbsp; With these powers, they were truly like people from the realm of legend.</p>



<p>“No.&nbsp; In reality, it’s not that special.”</p>



<p>“Whoa, Fumiya!”</p>



<p>I’d been reading quietly on my own, and I was startled that Fumiya had appeared behind me at some point.</p>



<p>Fumiya had something to say to me.&nbsp; “In the first place, the existence of humans who have the demon sight talent or who can control techniques akin to telekinesis are not restricted to House Minazuki.&nbsp; I spoke of it previously, but there are types of exorcists and spellcasters, and those who wield spiritual powers.&nbsp; In Kyoto, there is an organization for that kind of human.&nbsp; Day and night, it investigates disturbances and strange phenomena from the yokai and controls them.”</p>



<p>At that, I gasped.&nbsp; “Could it be that the Student Council President — is one of them?”</p>



<p>“You’re right.&nbsp; The Student Council President&#8230;Karen Tsuchimikado is an exorcist.&nbsp; Because House Tsuchimikado is a distinguished family of exorcists descended from Abe no Seimei.&nbsp; Among the Student Council members of Rakuyou School, not a few come from that line of family business.”</p>



<p>I saw.&nbsp; I had thought that the relationship between Fumiya and the Student Council President was different from that of ordinary students.</p>



<p>At last I understood why she seemed to know about the affairs of the Minazuki, and also why the whole Student Council seemed to be investigating the kakure paper image incident now.</p>



<p>“Is House Minazuki in that organization too?”</p>



<p>“Yes, the main family belongs to it.&nbsp; However, we do not possess the ability to exorcise evil spirits or exterminate yokai, so we are not exorcists.&nbsp; As for what we do, we are responsible for all kinds of support and healing.”</p>



<p>&#8230;Certainly, I could picture it.</p>



<p>If you told me that House Minazuki was a family that exterminated yokai, it just didn’t have that feel.</p>



<p>“House Minazuki manages the ‘Creatures of the Moon’ and from ancient times has assisted the organization and provided them with Lunar resources that are necessary to their line of work.&nbsp; &#8230;However, the Minazuki are of mixed human and inhuman blood, and for the organization, we are also a surveillance target.”</p>



<p>“A surveillance target&#8230;?”&nbsp; At those words, I was startled.</p>



<p>“The celestial maiden was not a human of this world.&nbsp; You might say that the robe of feathers legend is a representative of the ‘paranormal romance’ genre.”</p>



<p>The paranormal romance genre —</p>



<p>That referred to tales in which a human and a person who was not human developed a relationship and got married.</p>



<p>Among Japanese tales, there were stories of animals and humans, and also yokai and humans, but the celestial maiden, too, was classified that way as a “paranormal entity.”</p>



<p>When I really thought about it, that was true.&nbsp; The celestial maiden was what you’d call an alien&#8230;.</p>



<p>“There is a surprisingly large number of people with mixed human and inhuman blood, and their descendants, in Japan.&nbsp; Among my acquaintances are descendants of ogres and sons of tengu.&nbsp; However, House Minazuki is probably unparalleled in this country for the degree to which we have grown, held power, and accumulated glory.”</p>



<p>Fumiya’s calm voice, as if he were reciting a story, rang out in the storehouse.</p>



<p>“That is entirely because House Minazuki is able to monopolize the ‘Creatures of the Moon’ that are not found on this world.&nbsp; Only humans who bear the blood and genes of the celestial maiden can cultivate Lunar resources and draw out their powers.”</p>



<p>Gently touching the scroll that I was reading, Fumiya narrowed his eyes.</p>



<p>“House Minazuki does not wish to relinquish these rights and powers.&nbsp; Consequently, from a very young age, a betrothed is decided for us from within the family, and we strive not to dilute our blood.&nbsp; However, if these Creatures of the Moon are managed incorrectly, they would bring catastrophe.&nbsp; We cannot bring a ghastly end to the people of this world.&nbsp; If we did not utilize these within the bounds of our ability to control them, the world would be beyond saving.”</p>



<p>Towards that end, he said, both the main family and cadet branches of House Minazuki had decided on strict rules for handling Creatures of the Moon.</p>



<p>“Except&#8230;because the authority of the main family has waned recently, the cadet branches are doing as they please.”</p>



<p>“Could it be that the paper image incident this time also arose from inheritance issues, like before?”</p>



<p>I recalled that the night that Fumiya had come for me, a fire arrow had been shot into the Minazuki vacation home where we were staying.&nbsp; The main family and people from allied cadet branches had put out the fire immediately, and it didn’t seem like trouble had arisen, but that sort of thing happened often.</p>



<p>“It’s a shameful state of affairs, but that is entirely possible.&nbsp; Consequently, I must ascertain the cause.&nbsp; There’s no telling what the kakure paper image that snuck into the school will do next.”</p>



<p>Therefore, he was always shutting himself in the storehouse and investigating all sorts of things.</p>



<p>It would be good if I could develop some sort of power too&#8230;.</p>



<p>Exactly at that moment:</p>



<p>“Big Bro!”</p>



<p>All of a sudden, there was the sound of the storehouse door opening, and an extremely panicky You came flying in.</p>



<p>“The Student Council President and members&#8230;, that kakure paper image hurt them seriously!”</p>



<p>“What happened?!”</p>



<p>At You’s news, Fumiya and I both stood.</p>



<p>You explained that while they were investigating the paper image incident at the school, that kakure paper image had attacked them and caused a disaster.</p>



<p>We hastily left the storehouse and returned to the residence.</p>



<p>When we went up to the large tatami drawing room from the veranda, three people had been laid on futons that were spread out there.&nbsp; All of their bodies were as cold as ice, and they were unconscious.</p>



<p>“That’s&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I went white.&nbsp; I’d never even dreamed that such a thing could happen.</p>



<p>Umi and several Student Council members were performing first aid.</p>



<p>All of the Student Council people were wearing not their school uniforms but Japanese attire.&nbsp; It was called kariginu, the informal clothing of the nobility, right?&nbsp; Among them, a boy dressed in a black kariginu, who had sharp eyes and hair that stuck up, ran to Fumiya.</p>



<p>“Vice President Minazuki!”</p>



<p>“Ashiya, what is the situation?”</p>



<p>“While we were in the middle of patrolling the campus, President Tsuchimikado and her father, and Secretary Tamura encountered a flock of kakure paper images and were attacked.&nbsp; Their bodies are cold, and they’re not regaining consciousness.&nbsp; The kakure paper images pasted to their bodies have also vanished&#8230;.&nbsp; This is the effect of the curse, isn’t it?”&nbsp; The boy named Ashiya explained the situation.</p>



<p>Fumiya laid two fingers on the foreheads of the three people who were lying down and checked something.&nbsp; “&#8230;No.&nbsp; Due to their defenses, they can counter the curse.&nbsp; Their lives are not in danger, but perhaps these three have been stricken by the kakure paper images’ ‘Sign of the Moon.’&nbsp; If we peel off the kakure paper images stuck to their bodies and prescribe medicine for washing away the Sign of the Moon, there will be no issues.”</p>



<p>Fumiya looked at condition of the three fallen people and determined that.</p>



<p>It seemed that the kakure paper images had already stuck to the three people and turned into the medium for a curse.&nbsp; Even though I’d been able to see them the other time, this time I could not.</p>



<p>From the breast of his kimono, Fumiya took out his fan, whisked it open, brought it to his mouth, and whispered a few words.&nbsp; “Do not hide.&nbsp; Show yourselves wholly.”</p>



<p>Then he fanned it in the direction of the three fallen people.</p>



<p>It looked as if he were sending his voice together with the wind to the three.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p><em>Ahh&#8230;must show&#8230;must show&#8230;.</em></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>From somewhere came a monotone whisper.</p>



<p>Gradually, many whispers came in succession.&nbsp; Then the kakure paper images showed themselves.</p>



<p>“Oh&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Unlike the single one from before, lots of kakure paper images were pasted all over the three fallen people’s bodies.</p>



<p>Thanks to Fumiya’s command, the other people could see them too, and a stir rose in the room.</p>



<p>“So many kakure paper images&#8230;.”&nbsp; Even Fumiya was startled by this.</p>



<p>Although I sensed fury in his expression, he calmed himself at once and took out a tweezer-like object from a cabinet.&nbsp; Using it, he started to peel off the kakure paper images pasted to their bodies.</p>



<p>“Umi, make the Number 12 medicine and bring it.&nbsp; You, the Moon Draining medicine.”</p>



<p>“Got it!”&nbsp; “Okay — “</p>



<p>Fumiya gave instructions to his little sister and brother, respectively.</p>



<p>At a time like this, both of them listened to him obediently and moved swiftly.</p>



<p>I couldn’t just stand around either.&nbsp; Wasn’t there anything I could do?</p>



<p>“U—um!&nbsp; Fumiya, I’ll help peel them off too.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;At my offer, Fumiya was slightly startled, but he said, “&#8230;That would be helpful.&nbsp; In that case, please take care of Karen.&nbsp; Please place the kakure paper images that you peel off in this box.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;He handed me a pair of narrow tweezers and a black box.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Because we were undressing them, we separated the genders with a folding screen.&nbsp; I peeled off the kakure paper images stuck to President Tsuchimikado&#8230;Karen’s face and body as directed.</p>



<p>Even though they were easy to peel off —</p>



<p><em>Argh.</em></p>



<p><em>Don’t peel me off&#8230;don’t peel me off&#8230;.</em></p>



<p>In the process of peeling them off, I could hear the kakure paper images’ panicky voices, and I got a sensation I could not describe.&nbsp; Moreover, it seemed that only I could hear these voices.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I peeled them off one at a time.</p>



<p>Karen’s face was totally white.&nbsp; Even I understood that her condition was all wrong.</p>



<p>Afterwards, Umi returned and helped me.&nbsp; Paper images had even gotten into Karen’s clothing.&nbsp; We removed her complicated attire so we wouldn’t miss a single one.</p>



<p>“We’re done&#8230;,” I said.</p>



<p>“Not yet, Rikka,” said Umi.&nbsp; “Wipe the places where they were stuck with a hand towel soaked in medicine.”</p>



<p>“Ye—yes!”</p>



<p>While Umi gave me directions, I focused on wiping the spots where I’d peeled off paper images with medicine.&nbsp; I could see clearly that where I’d peeled them off, redness in the shape of the paper images was welling up.</p>



<p>Umi explained that if we didn’t wipe them with medicine, these shapes would leave scars.</p>



<p>Finally, once we’d had the three drink the medicine called “Moon Draining” that washed away the Sign of the Moon, the treatment was complete.</p>



<p>Umi, who was used to it, picked up Karen and carried her over.</p>



<p>“Ohh.&nbsp; The Tsuchimikado father has awakened&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Tamura woke up too?&nbsp; How are you feeling?”</p>



<p>On the other side of the screen, the two people whom Fumiya and You had been treating seemed to have woken up.</p>



<p>At the improvement in their condition, all the Student Council members who’d been watching over them cried out with joy.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Wait. This is weird.&nbsp; Karen isn’t waking up.”</p>



<p>Except, over on our side, Umi wore a grim expression.</p>



<p>It had been a little while since we’d had Karen drink the Moon Draining medicine.&nbsp; Although her complexion was much better than before, and her body temperature had risen, she showed no signs of opening her eyes.</p>



<p>“Oh no — was there a problem with how I peeled off paper images&#8230;?” I asked.</p>



<p>“Not at all.&nbsp; There’s some other problem.&nbsp; Maybe Fumi will know.”&nbsp; Umi stood and went to call Fumiya.</p>



<p>I quickly dressed Karen.</p>



<p>Fumiya came at once and looked at Karen.&nbsp; Flustered, I also watched over her, but:</p>



<p>“What is this?”&nbsp; Even Fumiya was bewildered.</p>



<p>All the paper images had been peeled off, and the Sign of the Moon had been washed away completely too.&nbsp; However, Karen wasn’t waking up.</p>



<p>“Fumi, she’s not actually going to die, is she?”</p>



<p>“Don’t say something so unlucky, Umi!&nbsp; This is&#8230;maybe&#8230;.”</p>



<p>At that moment, the bearded man who seemed to be Karen’s father peeked from the other side of the screen and shouted, “Oh no, oh no!” at his daughter’s state.&nbsp; “Her soul is missing!&nbsp; See here, it’s an out-of-body situation!”</p>



<p>“What?!”&nbsp; Umi and I rocked back without realizing it.</p>



<p>“But don’t worry, <em>Hariti’s Protection</em> will work just fine.&nbsp; By nature, Karen has a constitution where it’s easy for her soul to leave her body.&nbsp; She makes use of that in her work, but probably this time, at the shock of being attacked by large numbers of kakure paper images, it popped out without her intent.&nbsp; If we drive her soul back into her body, all our problems will be solved!”</p>



<p>As if this were a common occurrence, the other Student Council members were relieved.&nbsp; “That’s true.”</p>



<p>However, Fumiya alone wore a grave look.</p>



<p>“&#8230;In that case, it may be best to hurry.&nbsp; I think that even for us, Karen’s ethereal body, bearing the Sign of the Moon, will be <em>hard to perceive</em>.&nbsp; In this state, there is a possibility that even she herself will forget who she is.”</p>



<p>“Wha—what — — ?!”</p>



<p>In a breath, the mood of the room reversed itself, and Karen’s dad and all of the Student Council members raised a panicked commotion.</p>



<p>That panic was terrible.</p>



<p><em>If she’s hard to perceive, how will we search?&nbsp; Where will we search?</em></p>



<p>And so on.&nbsp; While they discussed it in a panic, everyone noisily went out of the residence.</p>



<p>Some of them would return to the school, some would head to the Tsuchimikado residence, some would head to places they’d heard she liked, they said.&nbsp; As specialists in searching for the Sign of the Moon, Fumiya and You too each followed a member of the Student Council.&nbsp; It was probably easier by far for them to check than for the others, they said.</p>



<p>“Rikka and Umi, please watch Karen’s body here!”</p>



<p>“Got it&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Yep.”</p>



<p>Fumiya entrusted Umi and me with watching over Karen’s body, in case something unusual happened or her ethereal body returned on its own and she woke.&nbsp; If that happened, we could contact Fumiya.</p>



<p>Even though so many people had been there making so much noise until just now, the Minazuki resident became empty and quiet.</p>



<p>“Sigh~.&nbsp; This got worse.”&nbsp; Umi looked completely exhausted.&nbsp; Yawning widely, she returned to her usual storehouse to check the state of the barrier set up around the Minazuki premises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Left alone in the drawing room, I busily put away the unused futons in the closet.&nbsp; Then I sat next to Karen’s body, looked at her unconscious face, and placed a hand on her forehead.</p>



<p>“Her temperature&#8230;feels normal already.”</p>



<p>Even so, I’d caught a glimpse of a scene from a dangerous world.&nbsp; Of the figures of people who accepted fighting invisible creatures as natural, coped with them calmly, and endeavored to deal with them.</p>



<p>They were high school students, but Karen and the others performed dangerous work that normal humans could not comprehend.&nbsp; Doubtless this sort of situation was routine.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Hmm?”</p>



<p>All of a sudden, I felt as if I could hear someone’s <em>voice</em> carried on an uncomfortably warm breeze that blew into the vast room.</p>



<p>It was Umi, right?&nbsp; No&#8230;.</p>



<p>Thinking that it definitely wasn’t my imagination, I went out onto the veranda.</p>



<p>I faced in the direction of the guiding wind, shut my eyes, and settled my ears.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p><em>—On dodomari gyakiti sowaka</em></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Hmm?”</p>



<p>At the list of mysterious phrases, I cocked my head to a side.</p>



<p>However, I recognized that voice, and I walked forward slowly.</p>

<p>Even though it was dark, I wasn’t afraid.&nbsp; The Minazuki had keen night vision.</p>



<p>Moreover, small butterflies that shone like platinum flitted about as if sewing the dark night.</p>



<p>“It’s the golden ring butterflies&#8230;.”</p>



<p>How beautiful they were!&nbsp; These golden ring butterflies looked far more mysterious than they had in the daytime.&nbsp; Perhaps it was because, in the dark, I could see the trail of golden scales behind them each time they danced.</p>



<p>When I extended a finger, several golden ring butterflies alighted on the tip.</p>



<p>On the premises of the Minazuki residence, the plants were also drenched in Moonlight, and they bore the Sign of the Moon all the more strongly.&nbsp; They had a fantastical presence.&nbsp; Now I understood that even better than before.</p>



<p>“We’re protecting Boss’ wife.”</p>



<p>“Watch your step.”</p>



<p>“Us are — the rare shining kappas.”</p>



<p>“We’re kappas who care too much about appearances.”</p>



<p>“Speaking of that — , Boss isn’t here — ?”</p>



<p>Ah, it was the tsukimari kappa.</p>



<p>Fluorescing faintly, the tsukimari kappa emerged from the thick grass and scampered around my feet.&nbsp; It seemed that they were acting as my bodyguards and guides.</p>



<p>The further I went into the back garden, which was overgrown with trees, the more I could hear small whispers coming from here and there.</p>



<span id="more-145"></span>



<p><em>Rustle rustle, whisper whisper.</em></p>



<p><em>Hee hee, sneaky sneaky.</em></p>



<p>The Creatures of the Moon seemed to find it incomprehensible that Fumiya was not on the premises.</p>



<p>And they also revealed an interest in me that they couldn’t conceal.</p>



<p>In the midst of all the whispers that came from all directions, I just barely caught the mysterious “voice” that I’d heard before, and I pursued it.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Over there, in a space below the Minazuki garden, was an open waterfront along the Katsura River.</p>



<p>On the rough, rocky area that stretched along the waterfront sat an indistinct form.</p>



<p>A transparent human figure —</p>



<p>Although I was startled for an instant, I realized at once that it was Karen’s ethereal body.</p>



<p>“Pre—President&#8230;. — Karen!”</p>



<p>I ran down the slope, calling over and over to the ethereal body shaped like Karen.</p>



<p>She was merely viewing the Moon from the riverbank, and when she noticed my voice, she turned around slowly.</p>



<p>“Ahh, you?&nbsp; Minazuki’s betrothed, I believe&#8230;Rikka Minazuki.”</p>



<p>The voice lacked the usual vigor of the person herself, and it held a quiet beauty.&nbsp; Perhaps because it was an ethereal body, it also seemed transient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, I knew it was she, and I was relieved.&nbsp; “Thank goodness.&nbsp; You’re here.”</p>



<p>“I must be worrying everyone.&nbsp; However, from here, the Moon is so beautiful.”</p>



<p>After giggling, Karen pointed out the night sky from where she sat.</p>



<p>When I followed her finger and looked up at the sky: “&#8230;Wow.”</p>



<p>The beautiful crescent Moon floated in the clear, bright night sky.</p>



<p>The clouds, outlined clearly by the Moonlight, and the stars that I could see from the middle of the empty mountains — I, too, was lost in the magnificence of the scene.</p>



<p>Smiling at the side of my face as she watched me, Karen said, “If I’m being honest, I’d forgotten who I was until just now.”</p>



<p>“What?!”</p>



<p>“I’d become an ethereal body, and because I bore the Sign of the Moon, I didn’t recognize my father or my friends either.&nbsp; I couldn’t return to my body, which was covered with kakure paper images, and I could only follow everyone around.&nbsp; On top of that, as soon as I entered the Minazuki premises, I sank into a state of, ‘Where is this?&nbsp; Who am I?’&nbsp; Ahaha.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Well, since I benefitted from being on the same wavelength as the Creatures of the Moon that bear the Sign of the Moon, that’s probably what happened.&nbsp; I was completely part of the things that breathe in these mountains.”</p>



<p>In the state of a semi-conscious ethereal body, acting only by instinct, Karen came to this place where she could see the Moon well, she told me.</p>



<p>“But, when I looked at the crescent Moon, I suddenly remembered a spell.&nbsp; When I whispered it, I remembered who I was for a moment.”</p>



<p>I listened to her story, and I remembered the mysterious words that I’d heard earlier in the residence.&nbsp; “Me too, I heard the voice.&nbsp; Your voice, Karen.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Is that so?&nbsp; You can hear the voices of ‘Creatures of the Moon.’&nbsp; Because, right now, my existence is close to that of a Creature of the Moon.”</p>



<p>Karen looked down.&nbsp; After watching a leaf float down the gentle night river, she quietly raised her head, formed her hands into a mysterious shape, and chanted.</p>



<p>“On dodomari gyakiti sowaka — &#8220;</p>



<p>As if in response to that list of mysterious phrases, a gentle wind blew.</p>



<p>I thought that it melted into the grandeur of nature, deep in mountains on Mount Arashi, and seemed to make the night air even clearer.</p>



<p>The drops of silver light that surrounded her also glittered more brightly.</p>



<p>“Was that, um, an exorcists’ incantation?&nbsp; You use spells this way or something&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Haha, well, you’re right.&nbsp; To be precise, it’s called a mantra.&nbsp; What I chanted just now lets me borrow Hariti’s strength.”</p>



<p>“Hariti?”</p>



<p>“Mmhmm.&nbsp; She’s a Buddhist goddess who takes the form of a mother who protects her child.”</p>



<p>Like a surprise attack, my chest tightened.</p>



<p>A mother — who protects her child&#8230;.</p>



<p>“It’s supposed to be the best for times when you don’t know who you are, so you remember your name, or your family, or things that are deeply connected to you.&nbsp; So I trust in my bond with my mother, and I keep chanting this mantra until I remember my existence perfectly.”</p>



<p>Clutching my right chest with my left hand, I asked nonchalantly, “Karen, do you have a close relationship with your mother?”</p>



<p>“Huh?&nbsp; Was it, I wonder.&nbsp; It was a close relationship between mother and daughter, like normal.&nbsp; My mother still seems to chant the Hariti mantra every day to protect me, too.&nbsp; Except&#8230;my mother died a very long time ago.&nbsp; It was unmistakably the work of the curse of something that hated House Tsuchimikado.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Oh.”</p>



<p>She lifted her head slowly.&nbsp; Sorrowfully, Karen looked up at the Moon.</p>



<p>“It was actually a curse aimed at me, but the Hariti mantra that my mother chanted over me every day — this defense took effect and transferred the curse to my mother.&nbsp; In short, she sacrificed herself.&nbsp; &#8230;She died in an extremely terrible way.”</p>



<p>I’d heard that House Tsuchimikado was one of the leading prestigious old exorcist families, even in Kyoto.</p>



<p>Because of that, in Kyoto there were yokai types that hated House Tsuchimikado and business enemies who saw it as an obstacle.</p>



<p>In addition, it sounded like House Tsuchimikado was split into many schools and factions, and that there was endless discord within the family.&nbsp; You might say that in that respect, its circumstances were similar to those of House Minazuki.</p>



<p>“After Mother’s death, Father put me through rigorous training so that I wouldn’t lose to any kind of curse.&nbsp; On top of that, I memorized many counter-curses.&nbsp; So I will not give any openings to those who entrap us, so I will not cause Father sorrow, so I will repay Mother, so I will not show weakness to my allies.”</p>



<p>And then, copying her father’s old-fashioned, vigorous way of speaking, clasping her hands behind her back, she acted out a strong version of herself&#8230;.</p>



<p>I was nestled up next to Karen so I wouldn’t miss her small, whispery voice.</p>



<p>“It was Father who built up a cooperative relationship with the Minazuki main family.&nbsp; House Minazuki’s powers and intelligence make possible ‘miracles’ that did not exist in this world previously.&nbsp; With the aid of that, Father must hope to prevent the deaths of&#8230;more family and friends.”</p>



<p>Karen lowered her gaze and looked at her transparent hand.</p>



<p>“However, Father and Minazuki must be absolutely shocked that I got into this mess.&nbsp; They’ll say that House Tsuchimikado’s heir is inadequate, and that they cannot rely on me.&nbsp; Like this, I can’t even repay Mother, who took my place.&nbsp; I must be disappointing her for sure&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Tha—that’s not true!”&nbsp; I shook my head hard.&nbsp; “Both your father, and Fumiya, and everyone on the Student Council too were truly worried about you&#8230;.&nbsp; I really wish I could show you how panicky they looked when they went to search for you.”</p>



<p>Even a newcomer like myself understood how much they admired and loved Karen.</p>



<p>I thought that even now, they had to be running all over the place searching for her ethereal body.</p>



<p>“Everyone truly cares about you.&nbsp; They care about you, so all they wish is for you to be safe.&nbsp; Even your mother — she would feel relieved, she wouldn’t feel the slightest disappointment.&nbsp; Because&#8230;if she hadn’t loved you, she couldn’t have protected you.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Rikka?”</p>



<p>Ahh, so after all, that did exist.</p>



<p>A mother who wanted to protect her own daughter, even to the death&#8230;.</p>



<p>As if to suppress the turmoil inside myself, I moved my hand to my chest and clutched it.</p>



<p>“Thank you, Rikka.&nbsp; I don’t know why, but I’m sorry.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was affected by the Moonlight, and I got a little fainthearted.&nbsp; Normally I don’t whine like this.”&nbsp; Abruptly, Karen’s ethereal body stood up from the rocky spot.&nbsp; “I wonder if it’s because of you.&nbsp; You’re good at listening, so I said shameful things without meaning to.&nbsp; I must have thought that&#8230;you might listen to me.”</p>



<p>It was the first time anyone had said that of me, so it made me blink.</p>



<p>Seeing that, Karen frowned, just slightly.&nbsp; “However, it’s a demanding task.&nbsp; For a sensitive girl like you, to be the bride of House Minazuki.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Huh?”</p>



<p>“Oh, but your betrothed, Minazuki, is a good guy.&nbsp; As his childhood friend, I will vouch for that.”&nbsp; In her ethereal state, Karen thumped her own chest.&nbsp; “Only&#8230;the burden that Minazuki carries is considerable, I think.&nbsp; Right now must be the roughest.&nbsp; For me, I still have Father, but for him, there is no longer anyone who would protect him selflessly.&nbsp; He has only himself to struggle to protect what is important.”</p>



<p>Only himself&#8230;to struggle to protect — what is important.</p>



<p>“That’s why I hope that you will listen to him, from time to time.&nbsp; I hope that you will detect his weaknesses, as you did for me.&nbsp; Because even though he can hold his own against adults, he is by no means one.”</p>



<p>Even though he can hold his own against adults, he is by no means one —</p>



<p>Again and again, Karen’s words made me recall my impression of Fumiya from before — that, somehow, he lived recklessly.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I understand.&nbsp; I won’t miss what Fumiya says.”</p>



<p>I didn’t know if Fumiya would show signs of weakness in front of me.</p>



<p>However, I thought that I didn’t want to miss what he said, as if I were listening to the whispers of Creatures of the Moon whom no one else could hear.</p>



<p>“However, you’re still a child yourself.&nbsp; A very young girl of sixteen marrying into the den of monsters that is House Minazuki — that’s an act of bravery that I simply don’t have.”</p>



<p>“Huh?&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; Den of monsters??”</p>



<p>Lately, fairly menacing words about House Minazuki had been filling the air around me.</p>



<p>In her ethereal state, Karen plonked a hand on my shoulder.&nbsp; “Well, if anything happens, let me know at once.&nbsp; I’d like to repay you for this.&nbsp; Speaking of that, let’s trade contact info, let’s trade contact info.&nbsp; &#8230;Oh, my phone is on my real body!”</p>



<p>She had an uncharacteristically foolish expression on her face, and she smacked her own forehead.</p>



<p>“Oh.&nbsp; Me too, they told me to contact Fumiya if anything happened!”</p>



<p>I’d brought my phone with me, so that was fine, I thought to myself.&nbsp; Right when I needed it, I took it out.&nbsp; But: “Oh&#8230;.&nbsp; I — I don’t have — Fumiya’s contact info yet&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“What?&nbsp; The two of you — aren’t you a betrothed couple?”</p>



<p>Only now did I realize that I didn’t have Fumiya’s contact info, and I went white.</p>



<p>It was a total oversight.&nbsp; Up until this point, I hadn’t even tried to get it.</p>



<p>“Sigh~, Minazuki too — what a time for him to be so careless.”&nbsp; With a sigh, Karen shook her head. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When I explained that even though we were betrothed, Fumiya and I had only just met, she was a little startled.&nbsp; Moreover, she smirked.&nbsp; Why?</p>



<p>“Well, why don’t we go back?” I suggested.</p>



<p>“Yes!&nbsp; I’ll return to my physical body quickly.&nbsp; I want to eat something sweet, anything will do!”</p>



<p>That vigorous style of speaking was gradually becoming more like Karen.</p>



<p>“There’s definitely a bar of red bean yokan jelly that we got as a gift in the cupboard.”</p>



<p>“Oh, that sounds good.&nbsp; Where’s it from?&nbsp; I want to eat it with strong tea!”</p>



<p>Tugging on Karen’s ethereal hand, I returned to the residence.&nbsp; On the back, the tsukimari kappa also came to our feet and guided us back to the residence, saying, “This way~.”</p>



<p>On the way back.</p>



<p>The golden ring butterflies that flitted around me suddenly left my side and fluttered off in the same direction.&nbsp; The butterflies led my gaze in the direction they were heading.</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>There was something in the forest.&nbsp; It was looking our way.</p>



<p>It shone brightly, and I could only see its silhouette, but I could tell that it was a stag with long, long antlers.</p>



<p>I realized that the golden ring butterflies were clustering and alighting on those long antlers, resting their wings.</p>



<p>As if bound hand and foot, we, too, could not move.&nbsp; After a short while, the owner of the silhouette with the long antlers slowly walked away.</p>



<p>“Just now&#8230;what was&#8230;.”</p>



<p>What in the world had that been?</p>



<p>“That was probably the guardian deity of this mountain,” Karen whispered next to me.&nbsp; She sounded shocked.</p>



<p>The tsukimari kappa hanging around my feet also sighed, “Thank you for coming, thank you for coming.”&nbsp; They rubbed their flippers together, praying while tears streamed down their faces.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“Oh, you’re back!&nbsp; I was getting worried about where you went~.&nbsp; Whoa, you brought Karen’s ethereal body?!”</p>



<p>When we returned to the residence, Umi was waiting next to Karen’s physical body, crunching on a popsicle.&nbsp; Indeed, it was just like Umi to spend her time relaxing even when she said she was worried.</p>



<p>As for Karen’s ethereal body, she stepped into her physical body from above with a “Heave ho,” and returned to her true body.</p>



<p>Ah.&nbsp; That must have felt good&#8230;.</p>



<p>Karen opened her eyes at once. &nbsp;She rested while having the strong tea and yokan jelly that I brought.</p>



<p>Before long, everyone who’d gone out to search for Karen’s ethereal body returned.&nbsp; Umi had contacted Fumiya and You.</p>



<p>When they saw that Karen had regained consciousness and was comfortably having tea and yokan jelly, everyone sagged with relief.&nbsp; Especially Karen’s father, who gave his daughter a big hug while sobbing.</p>



<p>It seemed that since they hadn’t found his daughter’s ethereal body, his anxiety had grown terribly.</p>



<p>“Don’t be silly, Father!&nbsp; I won’t kick the bucket so easily.”</p>



<p>“Because — it’s the first time this happened to you!&nbsp; Waaaaah.”</p>



<p>“Father, it’s hot.&nbsp; Your beard hurts.&nbsp; You’re sweaty and you stink.”&nbsp; Even as she said that, Karen stroked her father’s back.&nbsp; “&#8230;It’s all right.&nbsp; Mother — saved me.”</p>



<p>At his daughter’s words, her father opened his eyes wide.&nbsp; He said no more than, “I see.”</p>



<p>Only, from that conversation alone, I could tell just how tightly knit this family was.</p>



<p>To be honest, I envied that.</p>



<p>“About that.&nbsp; It was quiet Rikka over there who came for me.”</p>



<p>Karen pointed in my direction.&nbsp; I was sitting a little ways behind her.</p>



<p>At the same time, in a flash, everyone else here also stared at me.&nbsp; Fumiya too, of course.</p>



<p>Melting under the weight of their stares, I tensed and stiffened.&nbsp; While sweating profusely.</p>



<p>“If Rikka hadn’t heard my voice, I’d still be wandering the mountain for sure!&nbsp; Thank her instead.”</p>



<p>Karen deliberately turned to me, placed her hands ceremoniously on the tatami mat, and bowed formally.&nbsp; At the sight, I shook my head frantically.</p>



<p>“No — I didn’t do anything special&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Don’t be so humble.&nbsp; It’s all thanks to your power.&nbsp; I sensed it when I was close to being a Creature of the Moon.&nbsp; &#8230;Accompanied by golden butterflies,</p>



<p>you truly looked like a celestial maiden.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Karen giggled and turned to Fumiya next.&nbsp; “Minazuki.&nbsp; Your betrothed holds amazing power.&nbsp; Before her, the Creatures of the Moon that dwell in these mountains showed themselves, unable to ignore her, and showed their affection and interest.&nbsp; Even though I’d assumed the Creatures of the Moon are insentient, that recognition disproves it.”</p>



<p>Hearing that, Fumiya averted his eyes slightly and clenched his fist in secret.&nbsp; “That is the power of the eldest child of the main family.”</p>



<p>While it was still unclear whether Fumiya were done speaking, Karen exclaimed, “Oh!” as if she’d remembered something.&nbsp; She pointed at Fumiya.&nbsp; “And you!&nbsp; What were you thinking, not giving your betrothed your contact info.&nbsp; Because of that, we couldn’t contact you immediately.&nbsp; Even I traded contact info with Rikka first.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.Oh.”&nbsp; Fumiya showed an expression that I hadn’t seen before now and went stiff.</p>



<p>From behind, You burst out laughing, and all the Student Council members here acted baffled and began to whisper among themselves.</p>



<p><em>No way — the Vice President — he didn’t give his contact info to his betrothed?&nbsp; The Vice President?&nbsp; It’s unlike him&#8230;.</em></p>



<p>At that, I felt apologetic and embarrassed for some reason, and I shrank in on myself more and more.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“Rikka, you must be tired today.&nbsp; I’ll take care of the rest, so please go and rest.”</p>



<p>After the guests had left, as we cleaned up the drawing room, Fumiya worried about me.</p>



<p>“No, I’m all right.&nbsp; For some reason, I feel as if I won’t be able to fall asleep at once today.”</p>



<p>Was it because I’d walked alone in the Minazuki garden under the beautiful crescent Moon and interacted with the Creatures of the Moon?</p>



<p>Or was it because I’d seemed to find a task I should do?</p>



<p>“&#8230;All the same.&nbsp; I couldn’t hear her voice.&nbsp; Karen’s ethereal body was on the premises of the main home, and yet I didn’t notice.”&nbsp; Only, Fumiya spoke, sounding somewhat ashamed.</p>



<p>I recalled the reaction he’d shown earlier.</p>



<p>The reaction to the power that I bore, as the eldest child of the main family.</p>



<p>The loneliness and emptiness that lurked in it&#8230;.&nbsp; The regret.</p>



<p>“Um, about that!&nbsp; You too&#8230;you’re beloved too!”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“Oh, um, by the Creatures of the Moon!&nbsp; I can hear their voices, so I know.”</p>



<p>The creatures that gleamed faintly in the garden at night, while looking up at the Moon and sighing.</p>



<p>If those were the Creatures of the Moon, I had certainly heard them.</p>



<p>“The Creatures of the Moon that have taken root on Mount Arashi whisper to one another.&nbsp; ‘Fumiya isn’t on the mountain,’ and such; ‘I wonder when Fumiya’s coming,’ and so on.&nbsp; On top of that, the tsukimari kappa Number 6 kept scampering around my feet looking for you.&nbsp; ‘Where is Boss,’ he asked.&nbsp; All of them adore you.&nbsp; It must be because you’re always taking care of and pouring your heart into the garden&#8230;and those little ones.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Even if Fumiya couldn’t hear those voices.</p>



<p>Fumiya had been here for a very long time now, and had devoted himself to taking care of the Creatures of the Moon that had taken root on these lands.</p>



<p>Although I was the eldest child of the main family, I suspected that they were connected by a bond that was out of reach even for me.</p>



<p>That the tsukimari kappa had guided me was entirely because I was Fumiya’s “betrothed.”&nbsp; Even if they’d jumped the gun and called me his “wife.”</p>



<p>Fumiya wore a rare dumbfounded expression and was silent for a while.</p>



<p>Me being me, I was starting to fret that my words were disagreeable to him, or that, on the contrary, they had perhaps hurt him, when he spoke.</p>



<p>“Rikka.&nbsp; That.&nbsp; Do you mind&#8230;exchanging contact info?”</p>



<p>Lowering his gaze as if he were a little embarrassed, Fumiya took his phone out of the breast of his kimono.</p>



<p>At those words, I opened my eyes wide with a gasp.&nbsp; “Yes!&nbsp; Of course!”</p>



<p>I lunged forward, nearly falling, and nodded.</p>



<p>At my positive reaction, Fumiya acted a little surprised again.</p>



<p>Then, facing each other and fiddling with our phones, we exchanged contact info in a rather high school student-like manner.&nbsp; Truly, it was late to do so.</p>



<p>“I apologize,” he said.&nbsp; “It completely slipped my mind.”</p>



<p>“No, me too — I hardly use my phone&#8230;.”</p>



<p>As always, the two of us took turns blaming ourselves.&nbsp; From the outside, it might look a bit funny and laughable, but I thought that that, too, wasn’t a bad thing.</p>



<p>Rather, I sighed.&nbsp; Acting like this, we were making progress, bit by bit&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Oh, right, Fumiya.&nbsp; Earlier, I saw something mysterious in the garden.”</p>



<p>“Something mysterious?”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; It somehow shone with light and looked like a large stag&#8230;and had really long antlers.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Karen said it was probably the guardian deity of the mountain.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Holding his phone, Fumiya couldn’t even blink for a short while.&nbsp; At last, he blew out a laugh and nodded.&nbsp; Then he told me, in a voice that made a strong impression on me, “That might have been the guardian god of Mount Arashi, the protector of the Minazuki main family, one of the great Lunar spirits — Lord Ootsuno of the Mare Fecunditatis.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“&#8230;Lord Ootsuno?”</p>



<p>“He is a Lunar spirit, a special being who is even worshipped as a ‘god’ on the Moon.&nbsp; Lord Ootsuno must have come to see you.&nbsp; It is said that it was Lord Ootsuno who was the spirit that the celestial maiden founder loved very much.”</p>



<p>Fumiya explained how not even the Minazuki could manipulate the beings known as Lunar spirits.&nbsp; He said that all the Minazuki could do was inquire after their mood graciously.&nbsp; “What House Minazuki can do is preserve our <em>pact</em> with them, respond to their requests, and endeavor to act so that they do not exert a great influence on this world.”</p>



<p>If the Minazuki erred in their handling, these beings would bring calamity to this world.</p>



<p>However, he said, if their requests were heeded, they became local guardian deities who brought great blessings to the lands where they settled.</p>



<p>In a clear voice, Fumiya told me that the landscape here overflowed with greenery because Lord Ootsuno’s power pervaded the earth.</p>
