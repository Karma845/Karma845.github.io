<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 9: I Will Not Permit You That Happiness</h2>



<p>It happened on the first day of July.</p>



<p>Although it hadn’t been so in June, as soon as we reached July, the weather turned hot and humid, and I longed for cold things.</p>



<p>“Heave ho, heave ho.”</p>



<p>It took several little tsukimari kappa to deliver a wonderful watermelon to the veranda.</p>



<p>It looked as if Fumiya had grown it in the fields behind the house, and that it had just been cooled in the flowing mountain water.</p>



<p>“Are you okay?&nbsp; Should I pick it up?” I asked.</p>



<p>“Whew~&nbsp; It’s okay – .&nbsp; Us are strong.”</p>



<p>With nonchalant expressions, sprawling out one on top of another like fallen daruma dolls, the tsukimari kappa got the watermelon onto the veranda.&nbsp; While saying they were strong.</p>



<p>“You’re amazing, you’re amazing.”</p>



<p>At my praise, they were really happy.&nbsp; When I stroked their cheeks one at a time, they came to me over and over and stuck their heads out to be petted once more, especially Number 6, the spoiled baby.</p>



<p>Even as I played with those tsukimari kappa in moderation, I called You and Umi at once, and we cut open the watermelon in the sitting room that was open to the veranda.</p>



<p>As Chidori had told me to, I’d been wearing kimono for practice every day for a while now.&nbsp; Today it was a casual, thin, summery kimono with a pale blue lattice pattern on a white background.&nbsp; When I put my hair up, wore an apron, and tied back the sleeves with a sash, even doing housework in a kimono didn’t bother me much.&nbsp; I even had a Japanese-style sleeved apron.</p>



<p>“It’s really summer now, isn’t it?” I said.</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; Because it’s already July.”</p>



<p>Fumiya finished gardening and sat down on the veranda.&nbsp; Then he looked up at the thunderheads that floated in the sky, and he wiped the sweat off his forehead with the hand towel he wore around his neck.</p>



<p>The wind-bell chimed.&nbsp; It was a very peaceful moment.</p>



<p>As I brought chilled green tea to Fumiya, I remembered something with a gasp.</p>



<p>“Come to think of it, your birthday is in July, isn’t it?&nbsp; What day were you born?”</p>



<p>Umi and You, who came to the sitting room just then, heard my question and smirked.&nbsp; Picking up a piece of watermelon with his hand, You said, “Tell her, Big Bro.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s July seventh.”</p>



<p>Sitting on the veranda, Fumiya answered in a somewhat standoffish manner.</p>



<p>“That’s amazing, it’s the Tanabata Festival, isn’t it!&nbsp; That’s awesome.”</p>



<p>“Well, I guess so.&nbsp; I always get that reaction.”</p>



<p>My eyes were sparkling, but Fumiya’s gaze slid to a side, looking to the day after tomorrow.</p>



<p>“Fumi got dragged all over the place by Great-Grandpa on his birthdays, so he doesn’t have many good memories,” Umi told me.&nbsp; While expertly spitting watermelon seeds onto a dish.</p>



<p>“Yep yep.&nbsp; For House Minazuki, Tanabata is also a date that has a fair connection to us – ,” said You.</p>



<p>Since he wasn’t spitting out watermelon seeds, I wondered if he were eating them all.</p>



<p>“Tanabata is – to House Minasuki?”</p>



<p>So the “Tale of the Bamboo Cutter” wasn’t the only story with a connection to House Minazuki.</p>



<p>Now what kind of story was the Tanabata legend again?</p>



<p>Definitely a somewhat tragic love story of how Ori-hime and Hikoboshi were separated by the Sky King and permitted to meet only once a year on Tanabata&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Hey, hey, Rikka,” said Umi.&nbsp; “I want to eat your curry today.&nbsp; Summer is curry time, after all, curry – .”</p>



<p>Already fed up with this topic, she came up right next to me and told me what she wanted for tonight’s dinner.&nbsp; She snuggled up like a purring cat.</p>



<p>“See here, Umi.&nbsp; Don’t cozy up to Rikka only when it’s convenient for you.”</p>



<p>“Shut up, Fumi.&nbsp; Jealous, are you?”</p>



<p>Fumiya’s eye twitched slightly, and he coughed.&nbsp; “I’m saying, how about you help out with something too?&nbsp; After all, even when you go back to your room, you don’t do anything besides play games, right?”</p>



<p>“What?&nbsp; I’m busy with home security and laundry.&nbsp; I’m going through puberty, but I wash your guys’ underwear.&nbsp; Be grateful!”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“You tell us to be grateful,” You said, “but don’t you use a drum-type washing machine that even does the drying for you?&nbsp; You even use Telekinesis for the folding.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Shut up, You.&nbsp; Starting tomorrow, I’m going to hang your underwear on a tree right outside the house.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Cut that out.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;So.&nbsp; At our place, the housework was split up: Head of House duties and work in the gardens and fields for Fumiya, cleaning the baths and chicken coop for You, and home security and laundry for Umi.</p>



<p>&nbsp;And as for me, I cooked and made box lunches.&nbsp; This was the only task that it seemed no one had performed up until now, and it had become my job.&nbsp; Nonetheless, twice a week, Fumiya reserved days for take-out, so it wasn’t much of a burden on me.&nbsp; On those days, I tried to help with other things.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Curry, curry, hmm?&nbsp; Mmm, then how about butter chicken curry?&nbsp; Oh, but maybe butter chicken is too rich for the summer&#8230;,” I said.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“It’s fine, it’s fine!&nbsp; ‘Cause I love rich foods!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Hey~make it, make it~ she said.&nbsp; Acting like a spoiled baby, she hugged me at the critical moment.</p>



<p>Yep, she was so cute that her usual sharp tongue seemed to be a lie.</p>



<p>“Speaking of that, can you make butter chicken curry at home?” asked You.&nbsp; “I thought it was something they could only make in restaurants.&nbsp; Won’t it be too hard, Rikka?”</p>



<p>Suddenly, You acted as if he didn’t believe it.</p>



<p>“It’s surprisingly easy to make.&nbsp; But you need cream and butter and yogurt, so unless I go shopping&#8230;.&nbsp; Oh, but is it okay to use your yogurt, You?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Lately you’ve started using up my yogurt like it’s the most natural thing in the world.&nbsp; But that’s okay.”</p>



<p>“Oh, if you need groceries, I’ll go.&nbsp; Because it’s so hot.”&nbsp; Fumiya turned around from the veranda.</p>



<p>“No!&nbsp; Apart from that, we need other things, so I was thinking that I wanted to go shopping.&nbsp; Um, that is, then – would you like to go together?”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; After the sun goes down a bit more, let us go together.”</p>



<p>My heart beat a little faster.</p>



<p>I really loved the times when Fumiya and I walked together to go shopping.</p>



<p>All of a sudden, I felt a gaze on me from the side.&nbsp; Umi had narrowed her eyes and was looking at Fumiya and me.</p>



<p>“Wha–what is it, Umi?” I asked.</p>



<p>“The two of you – , if you’re on such good terms with each other, why the formality?”</p>



<p>“Huh??”</p>



<p>“A couple from what time period are you?&nbsp; The Showa Period?&nbsp; Fumi, you can’t get Rikka to open up her heart to you, can you?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>The watermelon that Fumiya was holding fell into the garden with a plop.&nbsp; The tsukimari kappa swarmed it.</p>



<p>“Tha–that’s not it!&nbsp; Because, Fumiya is&#8230;that is – he’s older, he’s the Head of the House.”</p>



<p>Even though it had been nearly a month since I came here, we’d used formal language with each other from the start, so it felt familiar.</p>



<p>She was wrong, it wasn’t because I was keeping a distance or not opening my heart to him or the like.</p>



<p>At this point, chatting with each other normally would feel sort of awkward&#8230;.</p>



<p>While I was all mixed up, You picked up another piece of watermelon, saying lightly, “Well, isn’t that all right?&nbsp; Isn’t it cute that they’re old-fashioned?&nbsp; In the first place, it’s not unusual among the Minazuki for married couples to use formal language with each other.&nbsp; Even if it might be unusual for high schoolers.&nbsp; Ah, in the first place, isn’t it unusual for high schoolers to be betrothed nowadays, and to live together on top of that – ?”</p>



<p>It happened as he was speaking.&nbsp; Umi’s frizzy hair stood on end, and her eye color changed.</p>



<p>“Hey, someone crossed the main gate.”</p>



<p>This was the sign that someone had stepped past her Barrier.</p>



<p>In the daytime on days off, we left the front gate open so it was easier for all sorts of guests and businesspeople to come in and out.&nbsp; If there were any trespassers, Umi would notice at once.</p>



<p>Immediately after that, the intercom on the front door sounded.</p>



<p>“Oh, I – I’ll go,” I said.</p>



<p>Putting off the question of formal language until later, I headed for the front door in a flurry.</p>



<p>“Anyway, you ordered something you don’t have online again, didn’t you~?”</p>



<p>“Did I order something?”</p>



<p>As I left, I could hear You and Umi’s exchange.</p>



<p>I, too, was thinking that it was most likely a package for Umi, but&#8230;.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Huh?”</p>



<p>I opened the front door, and the first sight I saw was long, straight, black hair.</p>



<p>A flowery pink dress that didn’t seem to fit the purely Japanese style of this residence.</p>



<p>The same – jet-black – eye color as mine.</p>



<p>“It’s been a while, Rikka.”</p>



<p>My eyes opened wide.&nbsp; Because standing there was my older twin sister, Mutsumi.</p>



<p>And –-</p>



<p>“Why, you’re wearing a cute kimono, aren’t you, Rikka.”</p>



<p>Looming behind my sister, looking down at me, was a woman with rose-colored lipstick and black hair cut straight across her shoulders.</p>



<p>I hadn’t forgotten her.&nbsp; She was&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Just as I’d expect from an old family like House Minazuki.&nbsp; But it doesn’t suit you, Rikka, does it?”</p>



<p>As easily as breathing, she rejected me.</p>



<p>She was my mother.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“Sorry about showing up out of nowhere.&nbsp; I heard that Rikka was in the care of House Minazuki, and I thought, `I have to come pay my respects’.”</p>



<p>Fumiya had shown my mother and twin Mutsumi, who’d come to the Minazuki main home without any warning, into the Japanese-style room for visitors.</p>



<p>I’d sent them an invitation to the Buddhist forty-ninth day memorial service, but they hadn’t even come&#8230;.</p>



<p>“When I came here in the past, it was this room too, I believe.”</p>



<p>My mother looked around the room and heaved a long, meaningful sigh.</p>



<p>“It is a pleasure to meet you, my name is Fumiya Minazuki.”</p>



<p>Faced with Mother and Mutsumi, Fumiya greeted them with the proper courtesies.</p>



<p>“By any chance, are you Rikka’s betrothed?&nbsp; They said only that you’re a relative, and the air about you is a little reminiscent of Rikuzou&#8230;.”</p>



<p><em>Mom, who in the world told you that I got betrothed?</em></p>



<p>Although Fumiya’s expression said that he also had his doubts, he didn’t inquire.</p>



<p>“Who is that?”</p>



<p>He looked at my twin, who was sitting quietly next to Mom.</p>



<p>“My daughter Mutsumi.&nbsp; She’s Rikka’s older twin sister.&nbsp; In short, Rikuzou’s <em>eldest daughter</em>.”</p>



<p>Mom emphasized that point heavily.</p>



<p>Just from that, I had a bad premonition.</p>



<p>“Well then, Ms. Katase.&nbsp; What can I help you with?”</p>



<p>“Katase” referred to my mother.&nbsp; She’d gotten divorced from Dad, and now Mutsumi used the Katase family name too.</p>



<p>Mom giggled and narrowed her bewitching, upward-tilted eyes.</p>



<p>“I heard that her `inheritance’ is here.&nbsp; Her late great-grandfather’s enormous inheritance.”</p>



<p>“What&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“Rikuzou must have received a share too.”</p>



<p>In the process of laying out the tea on the low table, my hands stilled.</p>



<p>Why had Mom come – about that matter&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Rikka has inherited all of it, hasn’t she?&nbsp; Isn’t that strange?&nbsp; Because, our Mutsumi is also Rikuzou’s daughter.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;What.&nbsp; She’s after the money?”&nbsp; Sitting on the veranda and listening to the conversation, You heaved a sigh and grumbled.</p>



<p>Although Mom cast a sidelong glance in his direction, she didn’t deny it in particular.</p>



<p>I was feeling lightheaded.&nbsp; I was filled with unbearable shame.</p>



<p>“It is unfortunate, but my great-grandfather’s bequests were handled entirely according to his will, and apart from a single bequest, everything else has been settled.&nbsp; I don’t know what you heard and from whom to make you come here, but Rikuzou, who left the family, was left nothing at all.&nbsp; Even the single remaining bequest is something of no value to you.”</p>



<p>“I don’t care.”</p>



<p>Nearly falling forward, my mother interrupted Fumiya in the same disagreeable tone that she used when scolding me.</p>



<p>“I will not permit Rikka to get everything that would originally have gone to Rikuzou.&nbsp; Her marriage to you.&nbsp; Having money, having land, for example, having trash that nobody else wants.”</p>



<p>Then Mom put an arm around Mutsumi’s shoulders.&nbsp; My sister was sitting quietly next to her.</p>



<p>“Mutsumi is cute.&nbsp; Always, only Rikka gets things, is chosen.”</p>



<p>“That is not the issue here.&nbsp; There’s too much that you don’t understand about House Minazuki.”</p>



<p>At Fumiya’s response, my mother clucked her tongue plainly.</p>



<p>“It’s no use discussing this with you.&nbsp; Please call an adult.”</p>



<p>“Mo–Mom&#8230;.”</p>



<p>At last, I faced my own mother and spoke to her.</p>



<p>“Fumiya is the Head of the main family.&nbsp; Don’t be – impolite.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Mom had assumed that Fumiya was merely the so-called heir, hadn’t she?</p>



<p>Although she looked a little startled, in any case, what I’d advised probably didn’t please her.</p>



<p>“Impolite&#8230;?”&nbsp; Her expression gradually twisted, and she spat out in a tone that made me flinch, “The impolite one is you, isn’t it!&nbsp; For not even telling me a thing about Rikuzou being sick until he died!”</p>



<p>“Tha–that was&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t have let Mom and Mutsumi see Dad like that.&nbsp; He’d been firm about not letting the two of them know about his illness.</p>



<p>“In the first place, why you?&nbsp; Not even I got to taste marrying into House Minazuki!&nbsp; What a joke&#8230;.”</p>



<p>My mother sounded terrifying.</p>



<p>I couldn’t say anything anymore.&nbsp; Noticing my expression, Fumiya answered resolutely, “Whether it’s a joke or not, Rikka has inherited the legitimate blood of House Minazuki’s main family.&nbsp; Mr. Rikuzou and I decided that Rikka would be welcomed into the main family.&nbsp; This has nothing to do with you, who are neither a Minazuki nor even Rikka’s mother anymore.”</p>



<p>Mom fell silent for a moment and glared at Fumiya.</p>



<p>Then, as if she’d thought of something, she switched to a sweeter tone.</p>



<p>“Say, sir.&nbsp; Why Rikka?&nbsp; How about our Mutsumi?”</p>



<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>



<p>“In the first place, I wonder how a marriage between relatives works.”</p>



<p>With a malicious smile floating on her lips, Mom brushed her own hair back from her shoulders.</p>



<p>“But – there’s a reason you must do it, isn’t there?&nbsp; Certainly I’m an outsider, but I do understand that House Minazuki’s main family must marry <em>Rikuzou’s daughter</em>.”</p>



<p>Then she gestured at Mutsumi, who sat by her like a puppet.</p>



<p>“In that case, that right belongs precisely to the elder daughter, Mutsumi.&nbsp; In addition, Mutsumi’s grades are far better than Rikka’s, and as she resembles Rikuzou in appearance, she’s beautiful.&nbsp; &#8230;Rikka is, well.&nbsp; I hate to have to say this, but she’s plain, isn’t she?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Fumiya had lost his ability to speak.</p>



<p>Looking down, I couldn’t say a word.&nbsp; I couldn’t talk back to her.</p>



<p>I felt embarrassed, ashamed, thoroughly miserable.</p>



<p>For sure, Mutsumi resembled Dad and was very beautiful.&nbsp; More than me by far, even though we were twins.</p>



<p>“Fumiya, was it?&nbsp; I am sure that Rikka is not suited to someone like you.&nbsp; She looks down all the time, she has a dark personality too,</p>



<p>and more than anything else, just having her there puts you in a bad mood.&nbsp; I’m sure everyone feels that way, right?&nbsp; She is unsuited to being the bride of the main family.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Ms. Katase.”</p>



<p>“You know that, don’t you?&nbsp; This child is the god of plagues.&nbsp; She wrecks everything around her.&nbsp; She destroys it utterly.&nbsp; When this child was a baby, she destroyed everything around her just by crying.”</p>



<p>&#8230;Huh?</p>



<p>I raised my downturned head.&nbsp; It was my first time hearing that story.</p>



<p>“She destroyed anything and everything.&nbsp; She broke her bottle and the window glass, she knocked over the table and the bed.&nbsp; Without fail, when this child bawled.&nbsp; It felt wrong, uncanny&#8230;no matter how you look at it, abnormal.&nbsp; Yet Rikuzou said it was just a coincidence and defended Rikka.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“In addition, you could say that from the time she was born, she’s been damaged goods, a dangerous child, hasn’t she?&nbsp; That’s Rikka.&nbsp; She got jealous of Mutsumi for being lovable, knocked her down, and seriously injured her.”</p>



<p>“Mom!”&nbsp; I raised my voice.</p>



<p>What happened that time had certainly been my fault.&nbsp; Yet it hadn’t been because I’d maliciously tried to hurt Mutsumi, but because I’d been trying to protect my sister from a yokai.</p>



<p>“Please, stop, Mom.”</p>



<p>However, to her, there was no other explanation than that I had tried to kill Mutsumi.</p>



<p>I was a ridiculously dangerous daughter.&nbsp; Consequently, as a mother, she was forgiven for hating me.</p>



<p>However, why was she telling Fumiya that story?</p>



<p>She had decided.&nbsp; She was going to say terrible things about me, she was going to create a terrible impression of me, and just how like her own share had been ruined, she wanted to destroy everything I had.&nbsp; My home.&nbsp; My life.</p>



<p>“See here.&nbsp; Acting like that, you pretend so easily to be a tragic heroine, don’t you?&nbsp; Even though your mom is only telling the truth.”&nbsp; Then, as if she were looking down at me, Mom announced, “No matter what, I will not permit you to know happiness as a woman.”</p>



<p>That sounded like a declaration of war.</p>



<p>“You do not have the right, you who tore me and Rikuzou apart.”</p>



<p>I could not have imagined my mother’s words.</p>



<p>However, that was the loathing that Mom had felt for me since long, long ago.</p>



<p>My own mother did not wish for my happiness.&nbsp; She hoped that I would be unfortunate.</p>



<p>Towards “Mom,” I felt&#8230;.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Sorry.”</p>

<p>I’d never been able to bear this venom.</p>



<p>No matter what I said, everything would be poisoned, and my words died on my lips.</p>



<p>So, right then and there, I covered up my ears with my hands.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Unable to say anything angry or to talk back to her, I kept apologizing.</p>



<p>Because I knew that the only thing I couldn’t escape from was apologizing.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry&#8230;.&nbsp; I’m sorry, I’m&#8230;sor&#8230;, Mom&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I’d thought that if I came here, I could forget everything.</p>



<p>However, my fear of my mother, her curse stained the depths of my heart and the back of my mind.</p>



<p>As if I’d knocked over a great tray, it overflowed and floodwaters rose within me.</p>



<p>As that happened, I could no longer breathe.&nbsp; I no longer knew what to do, I wanted to disappear.</p>



<p>The set of cords that tied back my hair&#8230;.</p>



<p>Without a sound, they came undone, now, and they fell.</p>



<p>“?!”</p>



<p>At the same time, in the blink of eye, the doors that encircled the room slid open.</p>



<p>Rhythmic sounds rang out, one after another.</p>



<p>The tea set broke, the lightbulbs exploded, objects around me floated up, flew back and forth.&nbsp; From here and there came the sound of glass shattering, over and over.&nbsp; A mysterious force whipped my long black hair.</p>



<p>Even the trees on the mountain shook their leaves as if they were calling to one another, and together with the wind, they set up a howl.</p>



<p>At the sight, as if remembering something, my mother cried out.&nbsp; Her face twisted in terror, and she hunched over.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry&#8230;I’m sor&#8230;.”</p>



<p>My rising emotions overflowed the vessel that was my body.&nbsp; I didn’t know anything anymore.</p>



<p>“Rikka!”</p>



<p>Fumiya shouted my name and grabbed the arms that I had over my ears.</p>



<p>“It’s all right.&nbsp; Listen to my voice only.&nbsp; You don’t need to listen to anything else anymore.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Fumi–ya.”</p>



<p>It was the power of his voice, wasn’t it?&nbsp; All of a sudden, I returned to myself, and I became aware of the power that I had used.</p>



<p>At that, the weird phenomena that had attacked my surroundings died down.</p>



<p>At the same time, the objects that were floating midair plopped down onto the table and tatami mats.</p>



<p>“Look here&#8230;, look here, she destroyed them!”</p>



<p>However, my mother leaned across the table in agitation, shouting loudly.</p>



<p>“Haha, ahaha!&nbsp; You saw that just now, right?!&nbsp; This is her true self!”</p>



<p>Then she stabbed a finger at me.</p>



<p>Now I understood that that had been the Minazuki family’s “Telekinesis.”</p>



<p>However, my mother couldn’t possibly have comprehended this power.</p>



<p>“You do that and are protected by men, you look weak, but you’re the weird one!&nbsp; You’re the monster!&nbsp; When will you disappear, for the sake of the world, for the sake of humanity&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“That’s enough!”</p>



<p>Fumiya interrupted my mother’s words in a hard voice.</p>



<p>“Do you realize what you’re saying to your own daughter?”</p>



<p>Slowly, I raised my head.</p>



<p>Fumiya was staring fixedly at my mother, his face full of quiet fury.</p>



<p>“Daughter?&nbsp; That’s a monster.&nbsp; I’m certain Rikuzou was hunted down by her abnormal power and died.&nbsp; But – it’s impossible&#8230;.&nbsp; How could Rikuzou be dead&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“If Rikka is a monster, then so am I.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“And so are you, a completely different – monster.”</p>



<p>At Fumiya’s words to her, Mom’s eyes twitched slightly.</p>



<p>“&#8230;You’re just another man, in the end.&nbsp; You side with the woman who trembles and sobs.&nbsp; Rikuzou was like that too.”&nbsp; Then, pressing a hand to her chest, she told him, “She destroyed everything I had!&nbsp; And yet, she’s doing that, acting like I’m the bad guy!&nbsp; From the moment she was born, she’s always been that way.&nbsp; That child keeps threatening me.&nbsp; And yet, Rikuzou had eyes only for Rikka.&nbsp; He said this girl&#8230;is special&#8230;.”</p>



<p>My mother’s face was full of fury and hate.&nbsp; Time and time again when I was little, it had been so.&nbsp; At her expression, the same as when she would forget herself and rail at me, I felt such fear that my heart froze.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I understand.”</p>



<p>Only, Fumiya looked as if he had comprehended something.</p>



<p>As if he had given up on pretty much everything, he was looking at my mother with a pitying gaze.</p>



<p>“You’re jealous of Rikka as a woman, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“In the end, it has nothing to do with House Minazuki.&nbsp; It is because, while you love Mr. Rikuzou, you cannot tolerate those who are connected to him by blood.”</p>



<p>“Wha&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“However, there is one thing here that I am convinced of.&nbsp; No matter how high hopes my predecessor Izayoi had for his heir, Mr. Rikuzou, he could never receive you into the main family.&nbsp; He could not recognize you as a bride of House Minazuki.&nbsp; That was very much the right call.”</p>



<p>My mother’s expression contorted violently.&nbsp; Perhaps she thought that she had been insulted.</p>



<p>But Fumiya didn’t flinch.&nbsp; Only I could tell from his voice that he was very, very angry.</p>



<p>“For now, please leave.&nbsp; Rikka’s health is not good.”</p>



<p>“Don’t&#8230;, don’t insult me like this!&nbsp; What’s more, I’m not done talking yet, because there’s still the matter of the inheritance.”</p>



<p>“<em>Please leave</em>.”</p>



<p>Firm words from Fumiya, as if he were pushing his wish onto her.</p>



<p>As if in response to those words, all at once the open doors around us slid shut, leaving only the one before the inner hallway that led to the front door.</p>



<p>Just like me, Fumiya was using his Telekinesis in front of my mother and showing it to her.</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Off on the side, my twin Mutsumi stood without a word.</p>



<p>“Mutsumi?”</p>



<p>“Mama, we need to go home.”</p>



<p>Then Mutsumi left the room through the open sliding door and headed towards the front door with brisk footsteps.</p>



<p>My mother panicked.&nbsp; She looked as if she couldn’t understand why Mutsumi was doing as Fumiya said.</p>



<p>“Oh&#8230;, I’ll call on you another time.&nbsp; Wait for me, Mutsumi!”</p>



<p>And then my mother, too, ran after Mutsumi and left the house in a flurry.</p>



<p>There came the sound of the front door shutting with a rattle and a bang, and as if a storm had passed, the house returned to dead silence.</p>



<p>“That&#8230;was shocking.&nbsp; They really exist, that kind of toxic parent.”</p>



<p>Sitting on the veranda, the first to open his mouth in the midst of this atmosphere was You.&nbsp; Slumped over, he came up into the sitting room.</p>



<p>A toxic parent&#8230;?</p>



<p>“Whew~&nbsp; She finally left?&nbsp; Hey, what are we going to do, Fumi?”</p>



<p>Umi, too, came back from her storehouse.&nbsp; Licking an orange-flavored popsicle, she seemed to have been watching our conversation with my mother through her monitor.</p>



<p>“That type of woman is – kind of a pain.&nbsp; It’ll be fastest to throw our lawyer at her and resolve it with money, won’t it?”</p>



<p>“If we could do that&#8230;.&nbsp; But she might not be after money.”</p>



<p>“And Rikka’s sister – she isn’t just a sister but a twin, that could be a bit of a problem too.&nbsp; On top of that, from a legal perspective, our opponent is the older sister, isn’t she?”</p>



<p>“But You.&nbsp; From a Minazuki perspective, there’s no mistaking that Rikka is the eldest child.”&nbsp; Fumiya seemed certain that I was the eldest child of the main family.</p>



<p>However, I&#8230;.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>Even now, my head was bent and I was looking down at the tatami mat, and I continued to apologize.</p>



<p>“It’s&#8230;all right now, Rikka,” Fumiya said.&nbsp; “They’ve both gone home.”</p>



<p>Worriedly, he put a hand on my back and rubbed it.</p>



<p>“You’re wrong.&nbsp; I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, Fumiya.&nbsp; Everyone.&nbsp; I’m sorr&#8230;, for all the trouble.”</p>



<p>Filled with shame, I picked up the set of cords that had come undone and, pressing them to my forehead, hunched over.</p>



<p>There was no predicting the extent of the problems that my mother would bring the people of this family from this day forward, now that she would not permit me to be happy.</p>



<p>In order to make me unhappy, she would do anything.</p>



<p>Why?&nbsp; Dad had died, so she couldn’t forgive me all the more?</p>



<p>What did Mom truly want&#8230;?</p>



<p>“?!&nbsp; Rikka, Rikka!” Fumiya called.</p>



<p>My body was hot.&nbsp; My head hurt.&nbsp; It was hard to breathe.</p>



<p>Then, my consciousness broke off with a snap.</p>



<p><em>&#8230;It hurts.</em></p>



<p><em>It hurts.&nbsp; It hurts.&nbsp; It hurts.&nbsp; Stop, stop Mom.</em></p>



<p><em>Don’t hit me.&nbsp; Don’t pinch me.&nbsp; Don’t throw me out.</em></p>



<p><em>Don’t look at me with those terrifying eyes.</em></p>



<p><em>And above all, don’t say anything.</em></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>In this world, there is such a thing as a toxic parent.</p>



<p>My mother was precisely a person who spits venom from her lips.</p>



<p>She was a mother who seemed to live to hate her own daughter, to detest me, to hurt me and plunge me into the depths of misfortune, even.</p>



<p><em>There are no parents who don’t love their own children.</em>&nbsp; Those words were no different from a fantasy.</p>



<p>In this world, mothers who can’t love their own children certainly do exist.</p>



<p>My mother and father had defied his family’s opposition and eloped, but although my birth was the fruit of their love, my mother was unable to love me.</p>



<p>However, just at seeing my twin sister, she doted on her to an embarrassing degree.</p>



<p>When my father couldn’t see, my mother’s attitudes towards my sister and me were unmistakably different.&nbsp; She said things as if to compare us on purpose, and her treatment of us differed as well.</p>



<p>For example, candy.&nbsp; She gave it to my sister, she didn’t give it to me, and so on.</p>



<p>For example, dresses.&nbsp; She had my sister wear cute clothes, she had me wear plain ones, and so on.</p>



<p>For example, expressions of love.&nbsp; Although she would stroke my sister’s head and hug her, she regarded me with a severe gaze and kept me at a distance, and so on&#8230;.</p>



<p>It wasn’t that I wanted candy in particular.</p>



<p>It wasn’t that I wanted to wear cute clothes.</p>



<p>As a child, I could sense Mom trying to hurt me, those things that were like “intent” and “hostility,” and anyhow, it was miserable and painful.&nbsp; Each and every day, I was sad.</p>



<p>And yet, as a child, I loved “Mom,” and I was desperate for her love.</p>



<p>Desperately, I listened to what she said.</p>



<p>Why Mom hated me, I had no idea, and I wanted her to spoil me like Mutsumi too.&nbsp; I longed for her warmth and her love.</p>



<p>And yet, my mother did not love me.</p>



<p>The older I grew, the more Mom searched for words to hurt me, she chose them, she spat them like venom, as if it were her natural right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rikka, why do you want to eat so much?&nbsp; You’re getting on my nerves.”</p>



<p>“Rikka, you’re a weird kid, so I’m not going to take you out.&nbsp; It’s embarrassing for Mom to be next to you.”</p>



<p>“You’re really ugly, aren’t you?&nbsp; You’re so different from Mutsumi.&nbsp; I wonder how you can be so different when you’re twins.”</p>



<p>“I don’t want to see you.&nbsp; I hate you.&nbsp; I feel sick, so don’t laugh.&nbsp; You’re noisy, so don’t cry.&nbsp; Go away.&nbsp; Don’t let me see you.&nbsp; No matter what you do, I can’t love you.&nbsp; Every single day, I hate you.&nbsp; Why, why.&nbsp; It shouldn’t have been like this, why&#8230;.”</p>



<p>That was how it was.</p>



<p>No parents bear children in order to hate them.</p>



<p>In the end, it was my fault, for being born a child who rubbed Mom the wrong way.</p>



<p>Words of rejection were engrained in me as a young child, and, tied to a lack of self-confidence, I grew more and more deaf to them.</p>



<p>Intense stress and extreme weight loss were the reasons.</p>



<p>My father noticed, and when he took me to the hospital, my mother’s treatment of me came to light.</p>



<p>With my Minazuki constitution, I wanted to eat even more than normal, which often made my mother annoyed at me.</p>



<p>Without fail, she gave me less food than she did Mutsumi, and from time to time, she found fault with me and made me go without dinner.&nbsp; As a result, I was below a normal body weight&#8230;.</p>



<p>However, on top of that, what scared and hurt me horribly was the violence of my mother’s words.</p>



<p>I had never wanted to destroy the relationship between my parents.</p>



<p>So I couldn’t tell my father that my mother would take away my food, recite words that denied my humanity every day, and occasionally grow outrageously violent.&nbsp; Because my father was busy with work and often left home on business trips and such, it took a long time for him to notice.</p>



<p>By the time he realized it, my mind and body had already hit their limit, and at that point, of my own volition, I had a feeling that I had “shut my ears.”&nbsp; If I couldn’t hear anything, then I could live not hearing my mother’s words.</p>



<p>The result was that my father divorced my mother.</p>



<p>In order to protect me, my father left my mother, taking only me with him.</p>



<p><em>In sickness and in health, ‘til death do us part.</em></p>



<p>Although they had pledged their love to each other that way, their child’s existence tore that love apart.</p>



<p>In order to make up for the lack of love that I’d known until then, my father raised me loving me with all his heart.</p>



<p>He patted my head, praised me, and hugged me.</p>



<p>He let me wear cute clothing, he let me eat lots of delicious foods.</p>



<p>Thanks to that, I gradually recovered, and my ears, which had been shut, began to hear again.</p>



<p>However, from that point on, it was as though my ears began to catch “sounds” and “voices” that were different from before&#8230;.</p>



<p>Now I understood.&nbsp; Those had mostly likely been the voices and register of the Creatures of the Moon.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Several years after that.</p>



<p>We were leading a quiet life as father and daughter, but my father developed a disease whose cause was unknown.</p>



<p>It was a strange disease where turquoise stones sprouted all over his body.</p>



<p>At the time of his death, my father was shriveled up like a rotted tree or a mummy, but the oddest part was that every night he would look up at the Moon he could see only through the window, and he would whisper over and over, “I want to go home,” “I want to see you,” and weep.</p>



<p><em>I want to go home&#8230;.&nbsp; I want to go home&#8230;.&nbsp; I want to go home&#8230;.&nbsp; I want to go home&#8230;.</em></p>



<p><em>I want to see you.&nbsp; I want to see you.&nbsp; I want to see you.&nbsp; I want to see you.</em></p>



<p>Where did he want to go home to?</p>



<p>Whom did he want to see?</p>



<p>Although Fumiya had said that those were symptoms of the Moon’s Return Disease, I still wondered whether Dad had wanted to see Mom.</p>



<p>In the end, my father had loved Mom the most to the end.</p>



<p>Even though she was a mother who had hurt her daughter, I wondered if he regretted and regretted and regretted that the person he loved had been such a mother.</p>



<p>He’d met the woman of his dreams, stood by that love, and thrown away even his old home and the family that had borne and raised him.</p>



<p>Even though they were bound by so passionate a love, my father had to leave the person he loved most in all the world because I had been born.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“In the end, you are a daughter of the Minazuki.&nbsp; You should not have been born&#8230;.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>I knew that.</p>



<p>If only I didn’t exist, my parents would still be a happy couple today.</p>



<p>If only I didn’t exist, my mother wouldn’t have hated her daughter to the point of being toxic, wouldn’t have detested her so much she couldn’t help herself, and things wouldn’t have been broken beyond repair.</p>



<p>And her ugly side wouldn’t have been exposed to the person she loved most.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>If it had gone that way, my parents could surely have stayed together forever, ‘til death did them part.</p>
