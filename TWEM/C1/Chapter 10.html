<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 10: ‘Til Death Do Us Part</h2>



<p>Unable to breathe, I focused only on the pain.</p>



<p>Why was it so hard to breathe?</p>



<p>Was I drowning?&nbsp; Was someone choking me?</p>



<p>However, at a certain point, someone called my name.</p>



<p>I felt a warm finger wipe away the tears that I had shed at being unable to breathe.</p>



<p>And then, suddenly, I could breathe, my lungs drew in oxygen, they no longer ached.</p>



<p>I could see light shining through my eyelids&#8230;.</p>



<span id="more-198"></span>



<p>“Rikka.&nbsp; Rikka.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Have you awakened?”</p>



<p>Right there, peering into my face, were the worried eyes of a boy with beautiful features.</p>



<p>And, gradually, my consciousness returned to reality.</p>



<p>“Fumiya&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“Yes, it is I.”</p>



<p>Fumiya gripped the hand that I stretched out from the futon.</p>



<p>It was an unconscious gesture.&nbsp; It was something that my normal self wouldn’t do, but just for now, I wanted to touch Fumiya, no matter what.</p>



<p>I – remembered.</p>



<p>For a long time after I met Mom and Mutsumi again, I was assailed by a fierce headache and vertigo, and I had collapsed.</p>



<p>That was embarrassing.&nbsp; All I’d done was speak to my mother, and this happened&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Don’t get up yet.&nbsp; Please rest quietly.”</p>



<p>I was trying to rise, but Fumiya stopped me and urged me to lie back down on my side.</p>



<p>His brow was knit in a grave expression.</p>



<p>Now I noticed that the room was full of the scent of medicinal herbs.</p>



<p>“Your Moon’s Return Disease flared again.&nbsp; Multiple small sprouts grew out of your neck, so I removed them just now.&nbsp; However, I think you still have a bit of a fever.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;The Moon’s Return Disease&#8230;?”</p>



<p>I put a hand to my neck.&nbsp; A bandage had already been wrapped around it.</p>



<p>Besides that, my body felt hot, and my head was a little fuzzy.</p>



<p>That was right, he’d told me that once that disease flared, there was a risk of recurrence.</p>



<p>That was right&#8230;.</p>



<p>“Ms. Katase will visit again in the future to inquire about Great-Grandfather’s bequests, but&#8230;.I think it best if you do not see her again.”</p>



<p>From Fumiya’s tone, I could tell that he was angry.</p>



<p>Although he stayed calm, his voice was a little low and seemed to chill my ears.</p>



<p>“I apologize, Fumiya.&nbsp; For the inconvenience&#8230;that I caused&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“No, that is all right.&nbsp; More than that, I am extremely angry about what she said to you, over and over.”</p>



<p>Fumiya spoke frankly, and I realized that he was angry on my behalf.</p>



<p>“I’d heard from Mr. Rikuzou that you and your mother were at odds, so I did know that.&nbsp; However, I&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Fumiya gripped my hand tightly.</p>



<p>“The reason for the lack of self-confidence that you sometimes reveal, the way you speak, the way you look so faint that you might vanish&#8230;.&nbsp; I believe I understand it.”</p>



<p>His expression held more pain than mine by far.</p>



<p>Looking up at Fumiya as if in a trance, I drew in a slow breath.</p>



<p>It was all right.&nbsp; I could breathe now&#8230;.</p>



<p>“I had a dream.&nbsp; A dream about long ago.”</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; You cried out a lot.”</p>



<p>I smiled wryly.&nbsp; That was probably the case, I thought.</p>



<p>Fumiya just looked at me, unsmilingly.</p>



<p>That was why, wasn’t it?&nbsp; In bits and pieces, I began to tell him about the dream.</p>



<p>I wanted someone – this someone – to hear a tale that I hadn’t been able to tell anyone up until now.</p>



<p>“Mom and Dad got divorced – that was when I was in middle school.&nbsp; One day a month, Dad would go visit my sister Mutsumi&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>“On those days, Dad would say that I could buy and eat whatever I liked, and he would give me money.&nbsp; But I was always anxious on those days.&nbsp; What would I do if he didn’t come home?”</p>



<p>However, I’d thought that it was a very selfish emotion.</p>



<p>Dad was Mutsumi’s dad too, the relationship between the two wasn’t poor, and there was no need to tear them apart.</p>



<p>Poor Mutsumi, who usually didn’t get to see Dad, I thought.</p>



<p>“That was why, on those days, I would visit a nearby library and read.&nbsp; I would read all sorts of books, but what I sought most were ones about curry.”</p>



<p>Dad loved that dish.</p>



<p>For a long time already, I’d often made curry using store-bought roux, but that wasn’t what I wanted to do.&nbsp; I wanted to cook the kind of restaurant curry that Dad sometimes took me to eat.</p>



<p>Following the recipes, I would buy spices and vegetables and meat with the money he’d given me, take them home, cook his favorite curry by trial and error, and wait for him.</p>



<p>At first, all I produced were failures.&nbsp; However, as I did it over and over, I became skilled at making spicy curry.&nbsp; Dad would hug me, happy that I had cooked and waited for him.</p>



<p>“I was really glad to make my father happy and to hear him praise me.”</p>



<p>It wasn’t just curry.&nbsp; Dad enjoyed many other foods too.&nbsp; So, memorizing them, I would cook them and wait for him, cook them and wait for him&#8230;.</p>



<p>It was all I could do.</p>



<p>If I didn’t do that, I would be crushed by my anxiety.</p>



<p>If I didn’t bind Dad with something –</p>



<p>I felt a secret fear that I couldn’t speak out loud.&nbsp; Even though he always came home.</p>



<p>“However, unfortunately, I saw them.”</p>



<p>That particular day, every supermarket I went to was sold out of an ingredient.</p>



<p>It was butter.&nbsp; I recalled hearing on the news that there was a nationwide shortage.&nbsp; All the same, I wanted to make curry, which used butter, for Dad.</p>



<p>I searched everywhere.&nbsp; I even took the train to many large supermarkets that straddled the stations&#8230;.</p>



<p>There, by accident, I saw them.</p>



<p>Dad and Mom and Mutsumi were walking in a row on the far side of the crosswalk.</p>



<p>They were all smiling, enjoying themselves.&nbsp; Even though I was a bit separated from them, my ears picked up the happy conversation and laughter of a three-person family that had nothing to do with me.</p>



<p>They looked so perfect, I thought.</p>



<p>Even though I wasn’t there, they looked like a beautiful family that didn’t lack for anything.</p>



<p>That was why, from that point on, I always knew something.</p>



<p>If I never existed, Mom wouldn’t have acted that way, Dad could have stayed together with his family, and Mutsumi wouldn’t have had her dad torn away.</p>



<p>“If only I didn’t exist&#8230;.that family would have been happy in all respects.”</p>



<p>A line of tears ran down from the corner of my eye.</p>



<p>No matter how you looked at it, I was the kid they didn’t have.</p>



<p>There was no substitute for Mom and Dad.&nbsp; However, even if I weren’t there in that family, Mutsumi would be.</p>



<p>“For what, for whom was I born&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Once more, I covered my eyes with an arm.</p>



<p>Ahh, I hadn’t wanted to let Fumiya know.</p>



<p>About the me that even my mother hated so much.&nbsp; The me that was nothing but a hindrance to my family.</p>



<p>The shameful me.&nbsp; The me that was so miserable, so laughable.</p>



<p>When I finally thought that I’d regained the will to live, this happened.</p>



<p>The me whose heart and body had been eaten away by the past and by the words of a curse, who immediately wilted and grew weak.</p>



<p>“My father said, right before he died.&nbsp; That I shouldn’t have been born&#8230;.”</p>



<p><em>As long as you’re here, I’ll be all right</em>, and so on.</p>



<p><em>Living together with you, I have been happy</em>, and so on.</p>



<p>I hadn’t hoped to hear dying words like those.&nbsp; However, I did wonder whether that had been my father’s revenge.</p>



<p>In the end, even Dad had distanced himself from me.</p>



<p>There was nothing left to do with myself.&nbsp; I hated myself.</p>



<p>Hated by all, I was the one who hated myself the most.</p>



<p>That was why I had heaved a sigh of relief when I realized that I’d developed the same disease as my father.</p>



<p>It wasn’t because I’d lost sight of a reason to live, with my father’s death.</p>



<p>Whether he were there or not, there wasn’t a shred of meaning for my birth into this world, so I preferred to die as well.</p>



<p>“In that case, <em>I </em>will become your reason for living.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Slowly, I lowered the arm over my eyes.</p>



<p>I was sinking deeper and deeper into an ocean of self-loathing and self-denial, yet those words latched onto me.</p>



<p>“Rikka.&nbsp; There is something I must tell you.”</p>



<p>And, with a resolute expression, Fumiya told me, “I like you.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Huh?”</p>



<p>A moment of silence.&nbsp; I blinked.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, when we visited the Fushimi Minazuki, I’d said something along the lines of, “I like Fumiya too.”&nbsp; Fumiya’s reply now came in this form.</p>



<p>No, even so, it was too abrupt.</p>



<p>This was another Fumiya-style frontal assault, wasn’t it?</p>



<p>“In addition, there is one more thing I want to tell you.&nbsp; &#8230;Long before you and I exchanged betrothal promises, I have known about you,” Fumiya said.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Huh?”</p>



<p>That was the first I’d heard of it.</p>



<p>“In House Minazuki, a betrothal may be decided by a certain person’s `prophecy.’&nbsp; Thus, I have known about you for a very long time now.&nbsp; Specifically, since I was three years old.”</p>



<p>Fumiya told me that House Minazuki’s members, especially those who would become heirs of the main family, were granted that by an influential figure who had the divine power of Prophecy.</p>



<p>Following those prophecies, House Minazuki would set the “most beneficial marriages” that would pass down even thicker blood.</p>



<p>– Rikka Minazuki.</p>



<p>That day, my name appeared in the prophecy for Fumiya.</p>



<p>From then on, the main family was aware of my existence.&nbsp; They concealed thoroughly it from those outside the main family.</p>



<p>To the Minazuki, my and Fumiya’s marriage was set in stone from that point on.</p>



<p>“My predecessor, Izayoi, rejoiced at your existence, and he always admonished me: In the future, you must marry Rikka.&nbsp; You were born for Rikka’s sake, he told me.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;That’s.”</p>



<p>A chill ran through my chest.&nbsp; Then tears streamed down my cheeks.</p>



<p>From the time he was a child, even the person he would marry had been decided by others, even his raison d’etre had been chanted at him continuously.</p>



<p>It must have been so suffocating for Fumiya.</p>



<p>It was the fate that bound him.&nbsp; &#8230;My father had felt that way.</p>



<p>“Please don’t cry, Rikka.&nbsp; For certain, the prophecy of this marriage continues to make me question my readiness as the Head of the main family.&nbsp; However, it has also sustained me for a long time, up until now.&nbsp; I have yearned for you&#8230;.&nbsp; You are my hope.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Hope&#8230;?”</p>



<p>That was the polar opposite emotion from what I was thinking.</p>



<p>Fumiya wiped away my tears with his finger.&nbsp; Then he smiled a smile that broke my heart.</p>



<p>It might have been the first time he’d smiled at me this way.</p>



<p>“The girl I must marry someday.&nbsp; The girl – who must appear before me someday.&nbsp; During rough times, I would always think about you.&nbsp; The girl named Rikka – what kind of kid is she?&nbsp; What’s she doing right now?&nbsp; Does she lead a happy life?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“The girl named Rikka – can she make it so that I am no longer alone&#8230;?”</p>



<p>The pain in his voice made my heart ache.</p>



<p>Fumiya looked up into the air.&nbsp; As if he were gazing at his long-ago self.</p>



<p>“Even when my father died, I remembered you.&nbsp; My parents were very close, so their parting was difficult for my mother to bear.”</p>



<p>Unable to see his grief-stricken mother, he was full of a sense of loss, he said.</p>



<p>“And then I thought about the `girl named Rikka’ whom I had not yet met.&nbsp; Someday, I had to marry that girl.&nbsp; Would I love and be loved, ‘til death did us part, could we understand each other like this, I wondered.”</p>



<p>“Fumiya&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“No matter how we spent our lives, when we grew old, which one of us, husband or wife, would pass away first?&nbsp; Thus, no matter who passed away first, I decided that there was something I would tell you.”</p>



<p>Fumiya dropped his gaze and regarded me once more.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“Thank you for being born.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>At those words, my eyes slowly widened.</p>



<p>Fumiya looked as if he couldn’t do anything but grip my hand, knit his brows with a gulp, and hold back his tears.</p>



<p>“Marrying, building a happy family, living a long life together.&nbsp; In my heart, I have already resolved on those things.&nbsp; That’s why I want to tell you&#8230;want to be told, `Thank you for being born.’&nbsp; I&#8230;.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>– For what reason, for whose sake was I born&#8230;?</p>



<p>– In that case, I will become the meaning for your birth.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>I felt as if I had just received my answer.</p>



<p>To live with this boy, ‘til death do us part, I had&#8230;.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry,” he said.&nbsp; “Going on like this, when we aren’t even married yet.&nbsp; I won’t mind if you laugh at me.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I won’t laugh.”</p>



<p>I gave a little shake of my head.&nbsp; Then I looked up slowly and met Fumiya’s gaze with moist, blurry eyes.</p>



<p>“I will not laugh.”</p>



<p>When I blinked, the tears fell, and I could see Fumiya’s face clearly.</p>



<p>What I had longed for, for so long.&nbsp; I had hoped that the one who could give me that – would be he.</p>



<p>If it were not so, it would be forbidden.</p>



<p>“I will become the meaning for your birth,” Fumiya told me again.</p>



<p>Then, naturally, we released the hands that were gripping each other.&nbsp; He embraced me as if he were wrapping himself around me, and I put my arms around his back as if I were catching him.</p>

<p>“I must make you happy&#8230;.”</p>



<p>As if he were weeping, as if he were biting them out, the words spilled and fell down.&nbsp; My ears caught them.</p>



<p>However, Fumiya had resolved that long ago.</p>



<p>I just hadn’t known it – that, for so long, there had been someone who felt thus about me.</p>



<p>“Fumiya, Fumiya&#8230;.”</p>



<p><em>Is it all right for me to stay here forever?</em></p>



<p><em>Is it all right for me be by your side?</em></p>



<p>“Is it all right for me to fall in love with you?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;It would be my privilege.&nbsp; If you could love me, it would make a man of me.”</p>



<p>Both of us were trembling.&nbsp; No matter how you tried to gloss it over, we were still timid children.</p>



<span id="more-201"></span>



<p>However, when we hugged each other, clinging to each other, comforting each other, making certain of each other’s existence, the desire to live filled me and gave me unexpected strength.</p>



<p>My heart felt rattled.&nbsp; He was too kind.</p>



<p>In that case, what could I do for this kind boy?</p>



<p>Fumiya had been waiting for me all this time.</p>



<p>Even though it was a thread of warped, red “blood,” it continued to bind us together.</p>



<p>A merciless prophecy turned out to be, on the contrary, young and pure –</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“Hey.&nbsp; Rikka, are you okay?”</p>



<p>Umi’s face peeked in through a narrow crack between the sliding doors.</p>



<p>She wore an uncharacteristically pathetic expression.</p>



<p>“Yes.&nbsp; I’m all right now.&nbsp; I’ve eaten the rice porridge Fumiya made for me too.&nbsp; I’ve really made you worry.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>For some reason, Umi was fidgeting.</p>



<p>Then she opened the sliding doors a little more, came up next to me, and tossed some objects on top of the futon.&nbsp; There were all sorts of things, but a lot of it was candy.&nbsp; Also, a game console.</p>



<p>“I’m giving you my favorite candies.&nbsp; Eat your fill, get better.”</p>



<p>“I will.”</p>



<p>“And then we’ll play games again.&nbsp; Next time, I won’t lose!”</p>



<p>“Yes, I look forward to it.”</p>



<p>Next, You unexpectedly appeared from the veranda.</p>



<p>“Today’s a little chilly.&nbsp; I brought a haori coat ~ .”</p>



<p>Like the consummate gentleman, he draped a haori coat with a pretty pattern over my shoulders.</p>



<p>Red plum blossoms had been painted on a pink background, and it was very beautiful.</p>



<p>“Thank you very much, You.”</p>



<p>“You’re doing better than I expected.&nbsp; Did something happen with Big Bro?”</p>



<p>Feeling as if You had seen right through me, I put a hand to my chest and nodded.</p>



<p>“Fumiya told me many things that I had hoped to hear.&nbsp; To the point where I can’t thank him enough.”</p>



<p>A grown-up smile playing on his lips, You said only that he certainly understood.&nbsp; Then he sat down crosslegged right next to me.</p>



<p>“I’ve been wondering why for a very long time now.&nbsp; Because you reject yourself so much.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Huh?”</p>



<p>“It’s weird, isn’t it?&nbsp; You’re a really great person, and you’re really cute, but you seem to believe that’s completely untrue.&nbsp; You lack self-awareness about all sorts of things.&nbsp; From now on, that will be dangerous.”</p>



<p>I blinked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chiming in from the corner of the room where she was playing a game, Umi grumbled, “Really, really.”</p>



<p>“However, if your mother had rejected you from a very young age&#8230;.”</p>



<p>You looked as if he were at a loss for words.&nbsp; He leaned to a side and scratched his cheek.</p>



<p>“Even though all sorts of things happened to us, all we knew from our parents was love.&nbsp; <em>How cute you are, how cute you are</em>, they told us, <em>good kid, good kid</em>, they told us, <em>I love you, I love you, </em>they said and hugged us.&nbsp; Even though we did fight, we siblings still trusted one another.&nbsp; That was why we could endure it even when bad stuff happened.&nbsp; That’s because, at the root, it is other people and their words of affirmation that make you believe in yourself.”</p>



<p>Then You said with lowered eyes, “It’s good if Big Bro is that for you.&nbsp; Of course, Umi and I are here too.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You.”</p>



<p>“You’re family now.”</p>



<p>You was happy go lucky and free spirited, but in this moment, he acted very mature and understood many things without my having to say them.&nbsp; He was considerate.</p>



<p>On top of that, he was very kind, just like Fumiya and Umi.</p>



<p>“That’s why, Rikka.&nbsp; Please take good care of Big Bro forever.”</p>



<p>Finally, with a joking protest, You prostrated himself.</p>



<p>Umi, too, raised her head and added, “I’m totally with You.”</p>



<p>“Haha, ahaha.”</p>



<p>That amused me, and I laughed for a fairly long time.</p>



<p>When I laughed, my heart grew whole once more.&nbsp; It was full, I realized.</p>



<p>All the siblings of House Minazuki had accepted me without rejecting me.</p>



<p>All of them were kind and sympathetic, yet they bore wounds that I didn’t understand.&nbsp; That was precisely why they could understand me.</p>



<p>Next time, I would face them.&nbsp; I wanted to understand those wounds.</p>



<p>I wanted to repay them, I thought, from the bottom of my heart.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was for that reason that I had to get past “the present.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>The next day, they told me take a day off from school.</p>



<p>I felt okay, but I still had a bit of a fever.</p>



<p>Although Fumiya said that he would also take a day off from school, I acted so apologetic that he considered the matter and discussed with his grandmother, Chidori Minazuki, in Fushimi.</p>



<p>Whereupon Chidori came from Fushimi to the main home without a moment’s delay.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Grandmother, you’re just as flamboyant as ever when you go out, aren’t you.”</p>



<p>“Oh dear, that’s no good, my lord.&nbsp; Haven’t I told you over and over, so many times, to call me Chidori, not Grandmother!”</p>



<p>Having her usual back-and-forth with Fumiya, Chidori came to my room.</p>



<p>She was clad in a black striped kimono and an obi with large red chrysanthemums, and on top of that, she wore sunglasses.&nbsp; She did indeed look flamboyant.&nbsp; However, she had a knack for dressing herself, she was very stylish, and the look suited her.&nbsp; And she was holding something, a bundle wrapped in cloth&#8230;.</p>



<p>I had just drunk my medicine, and when I tried to get up from the futon to greet her, she firmly told me, “Stay right there!” &nbsp;She was concerned about me.</p>



<p>Chidori removed her sunglasses, took a fan out of the breast of her kimono, and fanned her face.</p>



<p>“Lady Rikka, I heard about what happened.&nbsp; You have had a difficult time.&nbsp; Even so&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Chidori shut the fan forcefully.</p>



<p>The sound it made was too soft.&nbsp; Instinctively, I hunched my shoulders.</p>



<p>“That woman – for her to show up at the main home&#8230;!&nbsp; She’s the one who ran off with Lord Rikuzou – how laughable for her to bargain to inherit at this late date!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Truly, nothing good comes out of outsiders getting involved with the Minazuki!&nbsp; Lord Rikuzou too – he should have taken a good, hard look at the dark side of the Moon!”</p>



<p>Chidori was really furious.</p>



<p>When my father eloped with my mother, Chidori had had to offer up her own son to the main family.&nbsp; It was only natural that with that past, she would feel irritated at Mom and Dad.&nbsp; I felt all too sorry, and if there were a hole, I would have crawled into it.</p>



<p>“Chidori, that touches on the business at hand.&nbsp; I have to go to school now, too.”</p>



<p>“Ahh, that is true.”</p>



<p>Chidori got a grip on herself, undid the cloth wrapping, and took out a magnificent, long, narrow wooden box.</p>



<p>When she lifted the lid, something long and thin was stored there.</p>



<p>“This is&#8230;,” I said.</p>



<p>“As you can see, it is a `fan.’&nbsp; I brought it for you.”</p>



<p>“It is – for me?”</p>



<p>I tipped my head to a side as if to ask, <em>Why?</em>&nbsp; Chidori gave a cough.</p>



<p>“Does it not please you, Lady Rikka?&nbsp; House Minazuki’s fans are not mere fans.&nbsp; They use the Lunar World plant `shining bamboo’ as their ribs.&nbsp; We control our divine powers with these.”</p>



<p>Chidori took out the fan, and, pushing back her sleeve, held out the handle to me.</p>



<p>“This is for you.”</p>



<p>Obediently, I accepted it and opened it slowly.</p>



<p>She told me that both the Japanese paper that formed the fan’s surface and the bamboo that formed the fan’s ribs were made from Lunar World products.&nbsp; Although it was simple, it looked like a high-quality fan.&nbsp; A sweep like the Sky River was painted on a white background, and it was scattered with gold foil.</p>



<p>Fumiya took his own fan out of the breast of his kimono once more and opened it.</p>



<p>When I looked at it closely, his fan had a different color of silver foil.</p>



<p>“As an example, in my case, I have the power of the `Voice.’&nbsp; When I cover my mouth with the fan, when I fan my mouth, and so on, I can weaken or strengthen that power, or broadcast it.&nbsp; Apart from that, depending on the divine power that my opponent is using against me, I can defend against its influence or weaken it.&nbsp; Consequently, everyone in House Minazuki carries a fan.”</p>



<p>“Ahh, that’s why.”</p>



<p>Whenever something happened, everyone in House Minazuki took out their fans.&nbsp; I’d often seen that kind of sight.</p>



<p>I was disconcerted to find that there was an extremely clear reason for it.</p>



<p>I’d been so sure that it was to appear elegant&#8230;.</p>



<p>“But for me – what should I do to control my power?”</p>



<p>Mom’s words had shaken me badly, and my Telekinesis power had awakened.</p>



<p>Perhaps I’d be able to control it according to my own intent by using this fan, I thought, but I had no idea how to do it.</p>



<p>I furrowed my brows and opened and shut the fan and turned it over.&nbsp; Fumiya taught me how to hold it.</p>



<p>“If anything, it may be best for you to have something like an incantation or a protective charm for next time.&nbsp; However, it’s better to rely on something trustworthy to guard your heart.&nbsp; It’s the same for the rest of us.&nbsp; In doing so, we protect ourselves.”</p>



<p>“Yes, there is nothing to be ashamed of, Lady Rikka.&nbsp; From now on, by all means, please use it when necessary.”</p>



<p>Chidori, too, stressed that wish.&nbsp; Then she gave Fumiya a sidelong look.</p>



<p>“By the way, Head of the House, isn’t it about time for you to go to school?”</p>



<p>“Oh!”</p>



<p>With an uncharacteristically panicked yelp, Fumiya stood up.</p>



<p>“Then I shall take my leave.”</p>



<p>“Goo–goodbye, Fumiya,” I called after him as he hurriedly left the room.</p>



<p>At that, Fumiya smiled slightly in the hallway, said once more, “Goodbye, Rikka,” and closed the fusuma sliding door.</p>



<p>Oddly, it was Chidori who was more shocked than I by far.</p>



<p>“Chidori&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“That kid – he <em>smiled</em>.”</p>



<p>Did Fumiya’s smile signify something to Chidori?</p>



<p>She slowly covered her mouth with a hand.</p>



<p>“No, I see.&nbsp; Your influence must certainly be great.&nbsp; &#8230;I sincerely pray that this marriage will be the salvation of both you and Fumiya.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Evening, three days after that.</p>



<p>My mother and Mutsumi came to the main house once again.</p>



<p>My health had completely recovered, and Fumiya had gotten the documents regarding the main family’s inheritance in order.</p>



<p>Today, Chidori and Koutarou of Fushimi were at the main house too, as if they would deal with any problems that arose here.</p>



<p>However, Fumiya had told me that the inheritance affair was truly not worth worrying over.</p>



<p>That he was only concerned that my mother would say something, do something, to me.</p>



<p>“Rikka, will you really be able to meet with her?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yes.&nbsp; I will meet with Mom.”</p>



<p>Although Fumiya had said that I should let them speak to my mother and not see her myself, I felt that if I fled from her here, I could never&nbsp; escape the spell of her words for the rest of my life.</p>



<p>“From the beginning, those who do not bear the blood of House Minazuki have harbored a deep hatred of our constitution and powers.”</p>



<p>As he helped me put on my kimono, Fumiya told me this.</p>



<p>“Especially in the case of parents, they might believe that the child they have born is not theirs, and reject the child, and so on.&nbsp; My grandmother said that there are many cases like that.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;That’s why the Minazuki decide on betrothals within the family in advance?”</p>



<p>In the end, those who could get close to each other and understand each other were those who bore the same blood, he explained clearly.</p>



<p>With that logic, here was the reason for the marriages that they had arrived at after many tragedies.</p>



<p>“I believe that is the case.&nbsp; To date, more than a few people have left House Minazuki, like Mr. Rikuzou.&nbsp; However, I should say that the children and grandchildren who inherit our blood must return to House Minazuki, no matter what&#8230;.”</p>



<p>As for those who left House Minazuki as adults, they knew how to deal with their constitution and powers to a certain extent, and they could conceal them skillfully.&nbsp; As a result, they did fall in love with and marry outsiders.&nbsp; Precisely as my father had.</p>



<p>However, if those two people had children, and if the children showed strong powers from the Minazuki blood, the non-Minazuki mother or father’s would be extraordinarily confused.&nbsp; They’d get the impression that while this was their child, their existence was also of a different nature.&nbsp; They rejected the children with all their might, and they even hated them.</p>



<p>Then the children who had inherited the Minazuki blood would be starved of love.&nbsp; They would not understand their true nature or how to deal with it, they suffered all the way to the end, and they destroyed themselves.</p>



<p>“Why&#8230;isn’t my twin, Mutsumi, like that?&nbsp; She doesn’t have any divine powers, so not only can she not see Creatures of the Moon, but she also can’t see normal ayakashi and even ghosts.”</p>



<p>“The strength of the blood will vary from person to person.&nbsp; There are those like you, who have half outside blood, and yet the Minazuki side comes out strongly.&nbsp; And then, there are people like Mutsumi, where it comes out faintly.&nbsp; There are no examples of twins being born to the main family, so much is still unknown, but&#8230;.&nbsp; All the same, you are the one who has inherited the rights of the eldest child for sure.&nbsp; As the prophecy stated already.”</p>



<p>My spine straightened with a snap, as if someone had tied an obi tightly around me.</p>



<p>As I did so, I was wearing precisely a kimono.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Well, breathe, Rikka.”</p>



<p>I drew in a deep breath, then let it out.&nbsp; It decreased my nerves just a little.</p>



<p>Then Fumiya picked up a haori coat that hung on a kimono rack and stood behind me.</p>



<p>He told me that Chidori had prepared it for me, that it had been passed down through generations of main family wives.</p>



<p>I passed my arms through its sleeves and put it on.</p>



<p>It was so light and thin that I didn’t even feel as if I were wearing it.</p>



<p>On the fine, transparent fabric was embroidered a pattern of geometric lotuses.</p>



<p>When I gazed at it, I sank into a mysterious mood.</p>



<p>What words should I use to describe the sensation?&nbsp; Just by wearing it, all five of my senses grew sharp.&nbsp; Perhaps I should say that my heart was like the surface of water without a single ripple, unreasonably calm&#8230;.</p>



<p>Before long, the front door’s intercom rang.</p>



<p>Mom and my sister had arrived.</p>



<p>It was Chidori who welcomed the two at the door and brought them to the guest drawing room.</p>



<p>Although I could hear Mom’s voice, my heart was at peace.</p>



<p>In the breast of my kimono, I’d concealed the fan that I’d received.</p>



<p>“Let us go, Rikka.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yes.”</p>



<p>Then, together with Fumiya, I headed towards the room where my mother and sister awaited.</p>

<p><em>Aaargh, work has gotten busy, so I’m behind on translating! The next chapter might be later than usual. 😦</em></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“&#8230;Thus, matters regarding Great-Grandfather’s bequests have been managed according to his legal will, and they have already been divided.&nbsp; As he had left the family, Mr. Rikuzou inherited nothing.&nbsp; Mr. Rikuzou agreed to it himself when he visited House Minazuki while he was alive.”</p>



<p>With that, without any small talk, the discussion turned to an explanation of the inheritance.</p>



<p>My father himself had not left behind a large sum, and it had been divided equally between Mutsumi and me.</p>



<p>However, my mother’s goal was the House Minazuki bequest that she believed Great-Grandfather had left.</p>



<p>Because my father had originally been the heir of the main family, my mother’s intuition told her that I had inherited something special.</p>



<p>Only, my father had prepared all the necessary documents for this.</p>



<p>Perhaps he had realized from the start that this type of situation would arise, and he had visited the main family before his death to make all the preparations.</p>



<p>In short, from the start, Mutsumi and I had not received any share in the bequests of the late Head of the House, Great-Grandfather.</p>



<p>After listening to the brief explanation, Mom sipped the tea that she’d been offered.</p>



<p>“Well, before I came here, I tried consulting various tax accountants and lawyers.&nbsp; When they realized that their opponent would be House Minazuki, they immediately declined.&nbsp; This really isn’t a normal family, is it.”</p>



<p>“At that point, a normal person would have grown afraid and given up, but&#8230;our bequests aren’t things that can be handled by regular laws.”</p>



<p>As she was at a disadvantage, Mom wasn’t in a particularly good mood, but she’d stayed composed up to this point.</p>



<p>Leaving her no openings, Fumiya continued in a dispassionate voice once more.</p>



<p>“There is only a single bequest from Great-Grandfather that has not yet been inherited.&nbsp; However, I am afraid that it is something for which you have no need, and which would perhaps be utterly beyond your ability to handle.”</p>



<p>“What in the world is that?&nbsp; If there’s a possibility that it may become Mutsumi’s, speak without putting on airs.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Then I will tell you.&nbsp; It is a celestial maiden’s robe of feathers.”</p>



<p>My mother’s eye twitched, and she let slip an openly unpleasant reaction of: “&#8230;What the – ?”</p>



<p>As for Fumiya, he concealed his mouth with his fan and slid a cool gaze to the side.</p>



<p>“Ms. Katase, perhaps you are not aware of this, but we of House Minazuki are the descendants of a celestial maiden who descended from the Moon.&nbsp; Consequently, House Minazuki’s greatest, sole and only family treasure is the `celestial maiden’s robe of feathers.’&nbsp; If we’re speaking of what Mutsumi can inherit, then it is this robe of feathers.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the late Head hid it somewhere, and according to his will, the one who finds it will inherit it.&nbsp; Thus, if you say that you will search for the robe of feathers, I cannot stop you&#8230;.”</p>



<p>My mother was dumbfounded.&nbsp; Although she might have heard from my father that House Minazuki was the descendants of a celestial maiden, she was far from believing it.</p>



<p>“Ahahaha.&nbsp; What are you talking about?”</p>



<p>My mother laughed contemptuously.&nbsp; Fumiya’s detached gaze arrested her.</p>



<p>“However, do not forget.&nbsp; That not only those from our main family, but also those from the cadet branches are searching in a frenzy for the celestial maiden’s robe of feathers.&nbsp; What would happen if you laid hands on it and made enemies of all the Minazuki?&nbsp; I’m afraid there wouldn’t be a shred of good in it.”</p>



<p>Perhaps because Fumiya’s attitude and manner of speech didn’t waver at all, my mother, who’d been laughing up until now, began to lose her temper.&nbsp; She struck the low table with her fist.</p>



<p>“You’re talking nonsense!&nbsp; If that’s the case, then there isn’t any bequest left!&nbsp; In its stead, take Mutsumi, not Rikka, as the bride of the main family.&nbsp; You want a `daughter’ from the main family’s bloodline, don’t you?&nbsp; In that case, that right belongs to this child, the official eldest daughter!”</p>



<p>My mother’s selfish demand rang out in the drawing room.</p>



<p>As if in response, a momentary hush fell over this place.</p>



<p>“Mo&#8230;om.&nbsp; Um, that’s wrong.”</p>



<p>When I tried to step in, my mother threatened me, “Don’t chatter.&nbsp; I don’t want you of all people calling me `Mom’!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>I clammed up.</p>



<p>Yes, I understood.&nbsp; Mom wasn’t backing down.</p>



<p>Her goal had never been the bequest.&nbsp; She couldn’t allow me to be happy, to receive the Minazuki inheritance indirectly by marrying into the main family.</p>



<p>“Ms. Katase&#8230;what in the world have you been misled to believe?&nbsp; In the first place, marriage is based on the premise that the man and the woman get along, is it not?”</p>



<p>As before, Fumiya stayed cool.&nbsp; Both my mother’s attitude and words flowed with difficulty.</p>



<p>“There is only person in the world whom I wish to marry.&nbsp; It is Rikka alone.”</p>



<p>My eyes opened wide.</p>



<p>My mother, too, listened to Fumiya’s words, her expression one of incomprehension.</p>



<p>“Wha&#8230;, what are you saying?&nbsp; Yours is merely a marriage of convenience, isn’t it?&nbsp; Mutsumi is Rikka’s older twin sister.&nbsp; Mutsumi is more talented than her by far, she resembles Rikuzou and she is beautiful.”</p>



<p>Increasingly losing her calm, my mother turned hysterical and shouted.</p>



<p>“Mutsumi is too pitiable!&nbsp; Even though she’s a twin.&nbsp; Even though she was born on the same day.&nbsp; Always, always, always, only Rikka is blessed!&nbsp; This cannot be&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“You are an odd woman.&nbsp; In the first place, you were the one who eloped with Mr. Rikuzou to marry for love, weren’t you?&nbsp; Thanks to that, House Minazuki fell into a deeply problematic situation, yet this late in the game, you oppose Rikka and me marrying for love?”</p>



<p>“Wha?&nbsp; Marrying for love?”</p>



<p>“Yes, starting from a marriage of convenience, we intend to marry for love.”</p>



<p>Fumiya pulled off saying that with nonchalance.</p>



<p>At those words, I could hear all the Minazuki, who were eavesdropping, burst into laughter.</p>



<p>As for me, I was blushing unmistakably.</p>



<p>Although to Fumiya, he might have spoken those words to repulse my mother’s point, they made my heart pound, and I fell madly in love.</p>



<p>“Wha–what&#8230;is that&#8230;.”</p>



<p>Seeing me like that, my mother shook her head from side to side, and her expression twisted beyond that of irritation.</p>



<p>As if to say, <em>I will not permit that</em>.</p>



<p>“Yours is not a marriage of love&#8230;!&nbsp; It is not that!&nbsp; You’re marrying a partner who was prepared for you like a teacake, without undergoing any trials, the two of you!”</p>



<p>Perhaps it wasn’t the matter of the inheritance that clouded my mother’s mind.</p>



<p>It was only to deny our relationship.</p>



<p>“You’re different from Rikuzou and me.&nbsp; You’re different&#8230;.&nbsp; We were the real thing.&nbsp; Ours was a true marriage of love!&nbsp; No matter how much those around us opposed it, no matter how different we were in social status, we loved as if we were on fire, we needed each other, we loved and were loved!&nbsp; Even though we lost everything, as long as we had each other, that was enough!&nbsp; So we fled to a faraway place, we were together&#8230;!”</p>



<p>My mother brought a hand to her chest and made a passionate appeal.&nbsp; <em>We were different from you two, different, </em>she said.</p>



<p>Beyond anger, there was desperation, as if she wanted to believe that.</p>



<p>As I listened to her, a thought arose deep in my heart.</p>



<p>Because, until just now, I’d hated marriages for love, I couldn’t help it –</p>



<p>“Then why do you wish to force me to marry Mutsumi?&nbsp; It would be the polar opposite of a marriage of love, an unreasonable, unrealistic marriage of convenience.&nbsp; Are you truly considering Mutsumi’s happiness?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;That’s.”</p>



<p>Here my mother choked back her words.&nbsp; Fumiya went on, as if to press her.</p>



<p>“You simply want to interfere with Rikka’s happiness, don’t you?&nbsp;&nbsp; Your resentment against Rikka is extreme, but I must also pity Mutsumi, who is caught up in your emotional revenge.”</p>



<p>Although Mutsumi had worn an indifferent expression like a puppet’s up until now, a light gradually came into her eyes.&nbsp; With a gasp, she raised her head.</p>



<p>“Hey, Mutsumi.”</p>



<p>I thought that at this point, I, too, had something I needed to confirm with her.</p>



<p>“Do you want to marry into House Minazuki like Mom says?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Rikka.”</p>



<p>Although Mom shouted, “You, don’t speak to Mutsumi without permission!” I clutched the fan I had across my knees.&nbsp; It felt like a protective charm, and it kept my mother’s words from throwing me into confusion.</p>



<p>As for Mutsumi, she put a finger to her chin, said, “Mmm – “ and considered for a moment.</p>



<p>“Mutsumi&#8230;, Mama is thinking of your happiness, isn’t she?&nbsp; I have your best interests at heart, I believe that this is for the best.&nbsp; <em>You</em> can understand, can’t you?”</p>



<p>My mother kept chanting those words at Mutsumi.</p>



<p>“Umm.&nbsp; I really don’t get it, so I’ll do as Mama says.”</p>



<p>With a grin, Mutsumi tipped her head to a side cutely.</p>



<p>She looked like an innocent girl, and to me, she seemed a little sad.</p>



<p>Although she received Mom’s love, they depended too strongly on each other, she was completely under our mother’s thumb, and she believed that she should do as she was told.&nbsp; She wasn’t even suspicious about what our mother said.&nbsp; It was not her own wish – it was as if she were truly a dressed-up puppet.</p>



<p>“&#8230;That is all the more reason that I can’t give up Fumiya.”</p>



<p>My words made everyone gasp.</p>



<p>However, I had certainly decided of my own free will to lead my life here.</p>



<p>Drawing a quiet breath, I took a certain object out of the box that I had set next to me.</p>



<p>“Mom.”</p>



<p>I laid it gently in front of Mom.&nbsp; In a flash, Mom went pale.</p>



<p>“&#8230;What is – this.”</p>



<p>“Dad’s keepsake photo.&nbsp; The one that Dad always kept in his pocket diary, that he always carried on him.&nbsp; Take it, Mom.”</p>



<p>It was Mom and Dad’s wedding photo.</p>



<p>Wearing happy expressions, clad in a pure white wedding dress and tuxedo, the two performed a wedding ceremony full of hopes that only they two shared.</p>



<p>Although Mom was obviously at a loss, at last she ground her teeth and glared at me.</p>



<p>“You&#8230;, giving this to me, you’re mocking me!”</p>



<p>Mom’s wrath came across clearly.&nbsp; Perhaps, to her, it wasn’t something that she was receiving from me, but something that she was wresting back.</p>



<p>Although she was shouting at me in this manner, I felt a surprising degree of calmness.</p>



<p>Thanks to the fan, or the haori coat, or because Fumiya was watching next to me.</p>



<p>Had all of those allowed me to grow up a little?</p>



<p>“Listen to me, Mom.&nbsp; Dad – up until the end, he always, always, said that he wanted to see you.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;What?”</p>



<p>“The person Dad loved most up until the end was <em>you</em>.&nbsp; I realized that at the very end.&nbsp; That’s why this has been yours from the start.”</p>



<p>I turned over the photo I had set before Mom.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p><em>In sickness and in health, ‘til death do us part.</em></p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>There, in my father’s handwriting, it was written.</p>



<p>Mom, too, must have remembered love that they had vowed at the time.</p>



<p>With a slightly shaky hand, she took the photo, staring intently at the words that Dad had written, unable to speak.&nbsp; Because that vow had not been fulfilled&#8230;.</p>



<p>Mom hadn’t wanted House Minazuki’s inheritance in particular.</p>



<p>Only, as if Dad were by my side even now, she illogically could not permit it.</p>



<p>‘Til death do us part.&nbsp; Although they had promised that, she had been unable to be by his side in his final moments, and that was bitter and regrettable and drove her mad.</p>



<p>That was why I was planning to let go of Dad, whom I’d monopolized for so long.</p>



<p>“If that’s the case, if that’s the case, please divide Rikuzou’s ashes with me!&nbsp; If only I can have that, I.”</p>



<p>“That is impossible.”</p>



<p>At my mother’s request, I declared it.&nbsp; Before Fumiya refused.</p>



<p>At the clear way in which I expressed myself, Fumiya and Mom and even Mutsumi were shocked.</p>



<p>“Because Dad’s body has already returned to the Moon.&nbsp; You cannot guard him, Mom.”</p>



<p>“Wha&#8230;.”</p>



<p><em>What are you talking about</em>, was all that her eyes said.</p>



<p>However, it was something that only the Minazuki would understand.</p>



<p>I raising my head and stared steadily at Mom.&nbsp; A smile rose to my lips, as if the curse that she had etched into me up until now were flowing away like water, until not a single word remained&#8230;.</p>



<p>At the very end, I conveyed these words to Mom.</p>



<p>“Mom.&nbsp; Thank you for giving birth to me.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.”</p>



<p>“Farewell.&nbsp; Take care of yourself.”</p>



<p>If my parents had not eloped, I would not have been born.</p>



<p>No matter how much tragedy that truth had brought to those involved, it would not change.</p>



<p>That was why I had decided that I would live here, that I would determine the final outcome of my existence myself.</p>



<p>Under the low table, where no one could see, Fumiya gently touched my hand.</p>



<p>I squeezed his hand back.</p>



<p>As long as I had the warmth of this hand, I didn’t mind anything.</p>



<p>Right here and now, even though I was saying farewell to my parents, I was by no means alone.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>After that, pressing my father’s photo to her chest, with all the will to fight drained out of her, my mother went home quietly.</p>



<p>From her complicated expression as she left, I thought that she had not yet accepted everything.&nbsp; But all the same, she seemed to have retreated for today.</p>



<p>Only, Mutsumi, who went out the front door after her, turned back and spoke to me.</p>



<p>“Rikka.&nbsp; May I come back again to hang out?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Of course.”</p>



<p>“Yay.&nbsp; See you later!”</p>



<p>Mutsumi smiled innocently, glanced at Fumiya once only, and left the residence with light steps, her long black hair and her flower-patterned dress streaming out behind her.</p>



<p>And then the storm was over.</p>



<p>I stood motionless before the front door.&nbsp; Next to me, Fumiya asked, “Was that all right?&nbsp; Giving up Mr. Rikuzou to her.”</p>



<p>Perhaps even now, Fumiya believed that the words my father spoke as he approached his death were symptoms of the Moon’s Return Disease.</p>



<p>Perhaps that was true, perhaps not.</p>



<p>However, in the end, this was what I thought: “Giving up or not, from the very beginning, the person my father loved most was my mother.”</p>



<p>Even though that mother was someone who disliked her own child, who hated and caused pain.</p>



<p>Despite that, Dad had loved Mom all the way to the end.&nbsp; He was unable to hate her.</p>



<p>If I “wanted to prove myself superior” to my parents, if I “wanted to show” the two of them, the best way to do so was simply to live happily in this place, I thought.</p>



<p>We would definitely get married at some point.&nbsp; My love had begun from that prophecy and a promise.</p>



<p>Treasuring the emotions that had sprouted, I would lead my life here together with Fumiya.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>‘Til death do us part.</p>



<p>It was for that reason that I had been born.</p>
