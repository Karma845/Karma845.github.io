<h1>Chapter 22: Our Department</h1>

<div class="text-left">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While holding Her Highness in a side hug, I glared at the knight who wanted to take Her Highness away just now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s pathetic that the knights who protect the royal family are easily subdued.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”……”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The knight said nothing to intimidate me. Maybe they were only ordered to communicate with the princess exclusively.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The pale hand that reached for Her Royal Highness’s wrist was kicked off from the middle of its owner’s arm, and the tip that flew away was rolling on the cobblestone. The bleeding is… strangely low. Besides, the man didn’t seem to be in pain at all. Maybe that’s probably what it is. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, are you hurt? It looked like you hit your knee a while ago…” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“… Your Highness?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… Huh, yes. It’s nothing, it just got scraped a little.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I was relieved to hear that. It would be a disaster if she broke her knee from the impact of the fall. It bothers me that Her Highness is a little confused, but perhaps it’s because she’s still afraid. She’s an ordinary girl with no experience in combat after all.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I took my eyes off Her Highness and looked around at the knights surrounding us. They directed an eerie look that was devoid of life toward us… no, to be exact, at the princess in my arms while stalking forward.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it’s time to get out of here.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, I don’t have time, so I’ll give you a brief explanation.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your uneasiness isn’t ungrounded. They are insane… no, they are already lifeless, zombie soldiers who act according to the magic of mind control engraved by the operator.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh, you mean…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it’s the truth behind the disappearance of the royal guards, which has been a hot topic for several days. It’s a guess, but someone sneaked into the guard’s dormitory and attacked them. They created zombie soldiers by engraving the magic of controlling the mind on their bodies. Probably, they lost most of the blood when they were killed which explains the low rate of bleeding. Although, it exceeds the number of people I’ve heard before… I guess they put spare uniforms on zombies that had nothing to do with it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness bit her lower lip, balling her little fists with displeasure. I can understand that feeling very well. I can’t believe they did such a terrible thing to an honorable knight who protects their country and people… I feel nauseous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But we can’t help them anymore. The least we can do is to make them die again so that they can go to the other world.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">But there’s one more problem.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’d like to knock them down here… but I think I’ll lose.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness showed a clueless expression. It’s very cute, but now is not the time to admire it, so I won’t react.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, I’m very bad at close range fighting… and we are currently surrounded by strong people that became royal guards after being recognized for their ability even though they are dead. If I fight head-on, I’ll probably lose.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what are you going to do then?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the princess shouted, one of the knights came at me with a sword in his hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sophisticated movement that screamed years of practice. It seems their combat ability remained ingrained in their muscle memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the approaching sword and laughed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment… a dragon of fire burned down all the knights who were approaching us.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn’t I tell you? From now on, we will protect you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Footsteps echoed from behind me.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">There are two people.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you daydreaming about? If I hadn’t stopped him, you would have died.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“He has no sense of crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A relaxed voice without tension.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around and smiled bitterly.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for your hard work. Have you recovered from your hangover?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I’m all better now, aren’t I?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That oriental medicine was amazing. I’ll tell you which store sells it later.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes, after cleaning up?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">As we chatted, I stepped back while the two continued advancing, getting ready to confront the dead knights. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Short-range battles are their best field. I’ll leave this to them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, thank you and I’ll leave the rest to you. I’ll take Her Highness to safety. Please don’t lose…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told it to provoke them, Elto-san made the dragon of fire manifest in the sky, and Arina-san produced a plant tiger that grew through the stone pavement.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And glanced at me with a hostile smile.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Losing? Against zombies like this…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t even need five minutes.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… As expected.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">They’re reliable. Minus this morning’s sloppy hangover looks. If they were this cool on a daily basis, I would have a little more respect…</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, if they buy me time, it’s good. I don’t have to worry about anything.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I ran out with Her Highness in my arms and invoked the magic of body strengthening on myself. I jumped over, and using the walls of the private house as my stepping stones, swiftly reached the roof. Once again, I stepped on the tiles under the moon with high footsteps and ran.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please bear with me for a moment, will you? I’ll send you to a safe place at once.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, yes… well, even if you take a while, I don’t mind…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”No, nothing!” The princess said, holding her hands in front of her chest, and fell silent. Maybe being hugged by a man made her nervous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, she’s the first one I’ve ever hugged like this, too(laughs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked down, I saw a knight wearing a royal guard uniform in the alley. His expression was empty and he seemed to be searching for something. Well, I know what you’re searching for, but… I won’t let you have your way.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”… Death-Needle Thunder.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like the previous time, a little thunder struck the knight’s heart and he fell to the ground. Further detection was made, but no zombie soldiers were found. Maybe they’re still in town. If so, it will be very troublesome. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, we’re not the only ones defending the royal family.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out the communication stone and let the magic flow to my ears.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”… Yes, this is Milena-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s Raize. Elto-san and Arina-san were able to safely join me and rescue the princess.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, I understand. And I need to tell you something.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s the magical stone of a demon animal that you and Arina-chan collected before. It seems that a strange magic formula was drawn inside.” Milena-san sounds very serious. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“A magic formula?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”Yes, and it was engraved in the heart of the man who attacked you the other day. The lab kid just told me the results of the analysis.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… just sounds like more trouble, but can I leave them there for now? After all, the safety of Her Highness comes first.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”Okay, and you don’t have to worry about the zombie royal guards. For the Knights will cooperate.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“All right. I’ll see you later.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I removed the communication stone and placed it in my robes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after confirming that the four-legged creature is dead, I contacted Milena-san and decided what to do next. Arina-san and Elto-san readily helped me because they kept in touch in advance. After all, effective communication is important.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, you know, Raize-sama…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness looked at me nervously. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“The people you mentioned earlier are from the department that Raize-sama belongs to, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“? Yes, that’s right.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s this all of a sudden? They’re definitely my seniors. That’s why we can have such a friendly conversation. If it weren’t for that, I wouldn’t be able to talk to those monsters.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… Proficient in both overwhelming magic and precise manipulation. Have the ability and spirit to overcome the disadvantages of limited personnel… But…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Raize-sama.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Down from my arms, Her Highness looked me squarely in the eye, without worrying over how disorderly her clothes looked.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">There seemed to be some fear in her eyes. I have no idea what frightened her… </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your department… no, isn’t that the Royal Annihilation Force earlier?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I heard the remark from her mouth, I choked while my eyes opened wide… </span></p>
