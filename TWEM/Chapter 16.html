<h3>Chapter 16 &#8211; Result of the Investigation</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">——The next morning, I went to the royal castle alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good morning, Dillan. How did the investigation go?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We captured and interrogated Count Balazel yesterday, and he confessed to everything. At first he tried to play dumb, but when we showed him proof of the hidden passage leading from his house to Cobra&#8217;s hideout and the documents that came out of his house linking directly to the hideout, he caved in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see&#8230;but why did the Count have an underground passageway that connects to Cobra&#8217;s hideout?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That hideout is a building registered as a warehouse&#8230;it used to be a warehouse for the trading company. Cobra is an organization that moves from one base to another, and this one just happened to be that warehouse. Well, I guess they never thought anyone could ever discover their hideout in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, so that&#8217;s the reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a letdown&#8230;speaking of which, what about the other trading companies that were in league with him? Even though the Count was controlling them, they must have done a lot of shady things as well, didn&#8217;t they?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, Count Balazel——Almuth told me all about that too. We are going to capture them all today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh okay. And their punishment?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan thought about it for a moment and then opened his mouth.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-40107391' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-40107391' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ummm&#8230;Almuth is pretty much set for execution. Whether or not the Count family will remain and keep its title will be determined after we thoroughly investigate the family. The representatives of the business associations and any staff involved will be sent to the mines as criminal slaves. Since Cobra’s top executives are the only ones left alive, they will be executed after extracting as much intelligence as possible from them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, that&#8217;s fair enough. But what about their business associations? Seven heads up on a stake means seven seats up for grab, how are you going to deal with that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. If they have legitimate and innocent successors, I intend to allow them succeed their businesses, since the upper management of all the merchant associations are so deeply involved and culpable, there’s hardly anyone that they can be entrusted to otherwise&#8230;that said, if I were to go ahead and take them all down regardless, it would have a catastrophic impact on many people. Originally, I was going to seize some of the concessions as punishment, but if the government were to recover everything, it would make us look bad, as if we were confiscating all their properties, so I’d like to leave them in the hands of someone qualified&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan glanced at me as he said this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nope, no way I’m doing it. I&#8217;d rather grow my own business instead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, I see&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What about other trading companies?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mmm, well there are not that many trading companies that I can say for certain are trustworthy after all. Although there are few, if I allocate all those rights and interests to them, it will only lead to needless trouble, and the rest are small-time, or relatives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, there seem to be a lot of problems, such as not having the know-how to run a great merchant association, or receiving criticism regarding the act being the same as seizures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, we could make up some random merits and distribute the concessions to the ones we deem trustworthy. Now if we distribute them so as not to upset the balance of the Chambers of Commerce, doing that would pretty much mean that it’d largely still be run by the state&#8230;I just thought that with Haruto, very few would complain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmmm~, would a trustworthy trading company solve the problem?</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then remembered that a certain someone was now here in the royal capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How about Mr. Bacchus?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh right, you did mention he was an acquaintance of yours. I didn&#8217;t really consider him an option since he practically has no association with the royal family&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really. Well, I can assure you that he’s someone you can trust.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan and Rubel looked at each other when I said that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;All right, since you have that much faith in him, I’ll trust you. Can you handle the negotiations?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure thing. Are there any conditions he should be aware of?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well&#8230;I can allocate up to three trading companies to manage in its entirety. However, he will be required to hand over 20% of the sales for one year to cover the interests that were to be seized.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded my head anyway, because I could not judge whether the amount was too much or too little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I&#8217;ll go talk to Mr. Bacchus about those terms.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got up and was about to leave the room when Dillan held me back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A moment, Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How are things going with Iris?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;What&#8217;s with you all of a sudden?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan asked with a serious face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;So no kid yet uh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pfft!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y-You kidding. Iris is only 14 years old. No way in hell I am touching her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather, didn&#8217;t he say they were expecting a baby, as well? Amalia&#8217;s belly is getting pretty big, from the looks of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And don’t forget Iris hasn&#8217;t come of age yet, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rest assured, Iris&#8217;s birthday is just around the corner. She&#8217;ll be fifteen then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nice, that’s my cue to change the subject.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-80907952' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-80907952' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh really. We better make it one to remember then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I trust you’ll invite me, won&#8217;t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You bet. I’ll be on my way now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right. Later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that was a smooth exit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought to myself as I left the castle with Zebas seeing me off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;I wonder what he will say again on her birthday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I headed straight for the Bacchus Trading Company, Perdis royal capital branch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I passed by the Ashtaroth Trading Company on the way and saw that it was thriving again today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew that if I showed my face, I would get in the way, so I proceeded onward, looking at them from a distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took about ten minutes to walk from our store to Mr. Bacchus&#8217;s chamber of commerce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As gigantic as ever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is as big as our store, and it’s thriving as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manager of this store is Mr. Gulliver, with whom we traveled together. I always buy rice here, and he gives me quite a discount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it seemed that Mr. Bacchus had some kind of business and was in the store right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I entered the store and approached the female clerk at the counter. I&#8217;ve never seen her face before, so I guess she&#8217;s new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. How may I help you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sorry to bother you, but is Mr. Bacchus around? I need to talk to him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh the director? I’m afraid I can&#8217;t let you through without an appointment&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have to make an appointment&#8230;I guess, that&#8217;s normal if one is to meet the director of such a great merchant association.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh, I don’t have an appointment per se&#8230;but could you tell him that Haruto is here to see him on behalf of His Majesty, can you do that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the mention of His Majesty, the clerk started staring at me suspiciously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I’d be suspicious too.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clerk looked troubled and withdrew to the back of the store, where Mr. Bacchus seemed to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Director. There is a man here asking of you, says he’s here at the behest of His Majesty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His Majesty? Is it a messenger from the castle?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not really, he doesn’t appear to be a soldier or an official, but more like an adventurer&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the clerk from earlier and Mr. Bacchus came out of the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Master Haruto! I can’t believe it’s you! It&#8217;s been a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah it has. I&#8217;m glad to see you&#8217;re doing all right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Bacchus was staring at me in wonder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Bacchus explained to the clerk who was looking at her boss&#8217;s reaction curiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This man is Master Haruto, the one who saved me and the manager, Gulliver, from monsters before. He even patched us up afterwards, it’s thanks to him that we are still alive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-Is that so? Please excuse my rude behavior.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please, don’t worry about it, you’re just doing your job.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said this to the clerk who bowed her head to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Bacchus looked at me and said heartily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Look at you, you went ahead and became an even more bigshot adventurer than I thought. I knew you would eventually make S-rank, but who would have thought that you’d go beyond that to reach the unprecedented EX-rank&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customers around me seemed to notice these words, and their gazes were drawn to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Can we talk inside, is that okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, of course. Please come on in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Bacchus took me to the reception office inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After tea was served and we had settled down, I broached the subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I came here today to see you Mr. Bacchus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me, sir?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-43905496' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-43905496' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I explained as much as I could tell him about the situation surrounding the subject, the concessions of the chambers of commerce, and the conditions under which they would be granted, Mr. Bacchus groaned, “Hmmm”, and turned his head over and began to think.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t believe it, that trading company&#8230;considering these conditions and the expansion of our business——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the next few minutes, Mr. Bacchus mumbled to himself, but then he suddenly looked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next thing, he wore a big smile on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By all means, I accept the offer! If you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;d like to send some personnel&#8230;I think it’s probably better to speak to His Majesty directly about this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, that would be better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right. Thank you very much for bringing such a mouth-watering deal my way&#8230;by the way Master Haruto, your trading company seems to be doing very well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ha-ha-ha, thanks to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That toilet seat is so innovative, it&#8217;s a shame we can&#8217;t buy more of them. Nothing less from Master Haruto, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a bit embarrassing when Mr. Bacchus compliments me on business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you have any other revolutionary products?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. The prototype was completed without any problems, so we&#8217;re going into mass production——though I can&#8217;t tell you what kind of product yet, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ha-ha-ha. Was I too obvious?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Bacchus laughed broadly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well technically, we&#8217;re business rivals after all&#8230;oh and, about the toilet seat, I can give you some as gifts if you don’t mind?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh, are you being serious?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, when I think of how much you’ve helped me out, it’s the least I can do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said and took out ten of the ones for the nobles from my dimensional storage and handed them to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry about it&#8230;okay then, my business here is done, I better be on my way. I&#8217;ll let Dillan know and I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll send you another messenger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right. Thank you very much for today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, I went to the castle to inform them of Bacchus&#8217;s acceptance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan and Rubel, the king and prime minister of Perdis, looked relieved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see, he accepted the offer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, I told him to discuss the details directly with you, so I’ll leave the rest to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right&#8230;speaking of which, what are you going to do now, Haruto? You ventured into the elven village for Ephyr, got revenge on Glicente, and your trading company is steadily molding into what you envisioned. So what’s your next plan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told Dillan my plan after listening to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I was actually thinking of leaving the royal capital for the time being and going to another country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh, I haven&#8217;t decided on anything in particular. But I was thinking maybe Galzio Empire, one of the three great states that I haven&#8217;t been to yet, so now that I have the opportunity, I’m thinking why not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three great states are the Kingdom of Glicente, the Kingdom of Perdis, and Galzio Empire, they’re said to be the most powerful among the thirteen nations in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh&#8230;Galzio Empire.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Dillan was thinking about it with a serious expression on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it a bad idea?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nah, it&#8217;s a good country&#8230;I&#8217;m just worried because of the upcoming fighting tournament.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fighting tournament?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I tilted my head, Rubel answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the Galzio Empire, the idea that the strong are respected is deeply rooted, and even the position of emperor is fought over by those who have the right to succeed to the throne. The emperor himself attends the regular competitions as well, not only to spectate the bloody battles, but because it’s also a place for scouting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ohh&#8230;is that why you look so anxious?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current emperor, Oskar von Galzio is very greedy. He will do anything to get whoever he fancies. So far, quite a lot of the participants in the tournaments have been taken away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I see, he’s worried that I might be recruited or strong-armed?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see your point. But Dillan, do you really think an emperor or whatever could make me serve them just like that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nah, if anything, you refusing to do so would probably be what would end up causing an uproar. After all, the emperor would already have his eye on you since he witnessed your ability when you were promoted to the EX rank.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, that’s what you’re worried about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8230;couldn’t even confidently come out and say that there will be no problem, which is sad quite frankly.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then again, of course I couldn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, it’ll work out fine&#8230;by the way, Rubel, can you tell me more about this tournament? I would like to see how Iris, Finne and the others would fare, so I’m thinking of signing them up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh okay. Sure, of course. There are no specific requirements to participate in the tournament. The tournament lasts seven days, the first two days will be for individual qualifying rounds, and the next three days will be for tournament matches among those who passed the qualifying rounds to determine the winner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm? What about the remaining two days?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The remaining two days are for team matches. There are no qualifying rounds for this, just straight to the main competition.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see, that was very helpful, Rubel. Thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After listening to his explanation, I thanked Rubel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Dillan asked, as if he had just remembered something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You said you would like for Iris to participate, but how strong is she exactly?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He probably won’t even believe me if I told him&#8230;oh right!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gimme a minute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a flash of inspiration and sought permission from Dillan, then teleported back to the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grabbed Iris and teleported back to the royal castle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Dillan and Rubel had their eyes wide open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey Haruto! What was that&#8230;wow, daddy! Rubel! No way, the royal castle?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris was so surprised to see the two of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a magic called Teleport, it allows me to move instantly to a place I’ve been to before or within sight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Such outrageous magic skill, he made it sound so easy! &#8230;Anyway, why did you bring me here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, aren&#8217;t you accepting this a little too quickly? As if she could tell what I was thinking, she turned and glared at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan answered Iris&#8217;s question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing serious, we were just discussing about how strong you are right now, Iris.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-90463430' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-90463430' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, that’s it? If that’s it, then you don&#8217;t need to worry, I&#8217;ve gotten so much stronger!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, puffing out her chest with a smug look on her face, disclosed her status.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she chanted those words, a translucent window appeared in front of Iris.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““What the—?!””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Dillan and Rubel saw this, they were both astonished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength of the princess was no longer that of a country&#8217;s princess, but that of an A-rank adventurer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan asked me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-Hey Haruto. What did you do to Iris? Depending on your answer——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you talking about, Daddy? This was all thanks to my efforts, obviously!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris interrupted Dillan and got angry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can one become this strong through efforts alone?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course. And I can still become much stronger, Dad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-No. You’re plenty strong already, you don&#8217;t need to&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan looked troubled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It shouldn’t be a problem if Iris becomes stronger though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iris. Would you like to participate in the tournament in the Galzio Empire? Of course, I&#8217;d like to have Finne and the others participate as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris answered immediately without showing any sign of concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m in! I want Haruto to see how strong I&#8217;ve become♪.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All right, then all that&#8217;s left is to talk to Finne and the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please how do I get to Galzio Empire from here, Dillan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, you can either go through the Holy State of Belifaire or the Kingdom of Valna&#8230;if you take the route through the Holy State of Belifaire, you&#8217;ll pass through the holy city, which is beautiful and a good place for sightseeing.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-55462972' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-55462972' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ohh, that sounds exciting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holy city is, in essence, the royal capital, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name alone gives it a different feel from Glicente and Perdis, so I&#8217;m quite looking forward to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, then, we better start heading back&#8230;sorry to have taken so much of your time, Dillan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not at all, thanks for everything. Take care of Iris——Zebas, see Haruto and Iris off will ya.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood. Lady Iris, Sir Haruto, this way please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Zebas leading the way, Iris and I head for the castle gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Hey, Haruto, if I may?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why don&#8217;t we just teleport back home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since we’re heading home, let’s walk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was brought here out of the blue though&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris was not happy, and I could only reply with a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought we could take a little detour just the both of us on our way back, but I guess not?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris&#8217;s face turned red hearing this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“F-Fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, is there anywhere you&#8217;d like to go?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris was more happy than usual, perhaps because it was the first time in a while that we had some time alone together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want some of this! I want this and that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gotcha~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not bad to experience this once in a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first date in a while&#8230;maybe not exactly, but Iris and I went back to the mansion after enjoying our outing.</span></p>
