<h2>Chapter 16 &#8211; A Date with the Saintess</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next morning, after finishing breakfast at the inn where I had originally been staying at, I prepared myself and headed to the cathedral, and waited in front of Ilmina&#8217;s room. Finne and the others were helping Ilmina get ready. I had been waiting for quite some time and wondered if I should have stayed in my own room, but it seemed like that wasn&#8217;t the case. After a while, the door to the room opened, and Finne and the others emerged with beaming smiles. Ilmina, however, was hiding behind them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too surprised, Ilmina looks incredibly cute!&#8221; Suzuno boasted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With my touch, this is what you get!&#8221; Iris said, puffing out her chest with pride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She really does look lovely,&#8221; Finne agreed, nodding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even as a woman, I can&#8217;t help but admire her beauty…&#8221; Ephyr said, blushing slightly, with Asha nodding in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Come on, Ilmina, don&#8217;t be shy. Step forward.&#8221; Iris urged her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-I&#8217;m so embarrassed…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina poked out her head hesitantly, glancing at me before quickly averting her gaze. Even that was cute enough, but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Come on, get out here!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, wait, I&#8217;m not ready yet! Finne and the others, don&#8217;t pull me out!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina&#8217;s arms were grabbed by Iris and the others, and she was dragged out in front of me. To be honest, she was incredibly adorable. Instead of her usual saintess-like attire, she was wearing a simple white dress. Her skin wasn&#8217;t exposed as much as usual, but that only added to her pure and innocent appearance. She looked simply lovely. Clearly very embarrassed, Ilmina&#8217;s cheeks flushed as she tried to hide again, but Iris and the others wouldn&#8217;t let her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be shy, show yourself properly!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But I don&#8217;t usually wear something like this&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s there to be embarrassed about, Ilmina?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll change back into my usual clothes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, Ilmina, you look adorable. Be confident!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Suzuno, Iris, and Finne all telling her such things, Ilmina had nowhere left to run. She tearfully turned to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um, Haruto, does it&#8230; not look strange?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina&#8217;s face was flushed, and she had an uneasy expression. I clearly expressed what I thought,&#8221;You look great. And since everyone says you look great, you can be more confident.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Th-Thank you&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Ilmina started to look down, Iris gave her a small shove.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, wait!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina stumbled and ended up in my embrace. Her chest pressed against mine, the soft sensation transmitting through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She quickly moved away from me, but her face remained flushed. I told her not to worry, but she kept mumbling, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I jumped into Haruto&#8217;s chest&#8230;&#8221; I doubt she even heard me. I glanced at Iris, who was making a smug face, her thumb up as if to say, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t I clever?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wasn&#8217;t that more counterproductive?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, Iris and Finne pushed us along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anyway, get going. You won&#8217;t see each other for a while.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Haruto, please take good care of Ilmina.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that said, I replied, &#8220;I leave the house-sitting to you,&#8221; and turned back to Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ilmina, shall we go&#8230;? Ilmina&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wha-! Y-Yes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took a second call to snap her out of her daze, as she hurriedly responded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We walked out of the cathedral and strolled for a while, but Ilmina seemed fidgety and restless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is something wrong? You seem uneasy&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you try to relax?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to, but I don&#8217;t know what to talk about&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see. That&#8217;s the issue. I should bring up a topic myself, but we’ve already talked about various things yesterday, and I couldn&#8217;t think of a specific topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even if you don&#8217;t have a topic, you can talk about recent events. Don&#8217;t force yourself to talk; conversations will happen naturally.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s how it is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I brushed off the fact that I also couldn&#8217;t think of a topic, Ilmina seemed to accept my words. However, she soon got lost in thought again, so I suddenly mentioned something that came to mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, I didn&#8217;t have a chance to apologize to Iris and Finne for this sudden development.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t worry about it. Iris has always been like this, so I&#8217;m actually glad she hasn&#8217;t changed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina smiled wryly. Huh, so that was Iris in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What was Iris like back then?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the past?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, I only know the current Iris. I&#8217;d like you to tell me something I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure. Well&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we walked through the capital city, Ilmina shared amusing stories about Iris&#8217; past. I&#8217;m glad her tension seems to have eased. Then, in the middle of our conversation, Ilmina mentioned something unbelievable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That time when I tried Iris&#8217;s homemade cooking&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had heard stories of Iris&#8217;s cooking being the cause of a terrible experience for her father, Dillan. I couldn&#8217;t believe Ilmina was also a victim…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;S-So, how was it?&#8221; I cautiously asked, and Ilmina answered with a pale face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was dreadful&#8230; even my father and Gawain fell victim to it&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah&#8230; my condolences.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympathizing with me, Ilmina asked how it was for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, have you ever tried her cooking?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I did have her make pancakes for me when I was with Asha&#8230; the appearance aside, they were actually delicious.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wait, they were delicious!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina looked surprised. It was understandable, for those who have tasted Iris&#8217;s cooking, that would be the natural reaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haha, I guess so. I&#8217;ll tell Iris that &#8216;Ilmina is dying to taste her cooking.'&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please don&#8217;t do that!&#8221; Ilmina panicked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;ll be fine if you&#8217;re prepared for it. Of course, we&#8217;ll have someone supervising her&#8230; probably.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t make me even more worried!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a little while, Ilmina and I burst into laughter. The initial stiffness had disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How about now? Feeling more relaxed?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did you do that on purpose?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who knows?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina stared intently at my face, then broke into a smile and said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s just say that&#8217;s the case.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we walked for a while, a delicious smell wafted our way from somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s coming from over there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I checked the direction Ilmina indicated, there was a street stall grilling skewers of some kind of meat. I thought that there weren&#8217;t many stalls when we walked past earlier, but it seems some places did have them. The stall owner noticed us looking and called out to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, you two! How about a skewer?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What kind of meat is this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s Whitebird meat.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitebird? I remember&#8230; Oh, that&#8217;s the meat I had before! I had it at the city of Waxe, the first place we arrived at after being kicked out of Glicente. It was pretty tasty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are&#8230; could it be the Saintess and the Hero who saved our country?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s true, Ilmina is the Saintess, and I am the so-called Hero. But let me correct you: I&#8217;m not really a hero, just an adventurer.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so? Well, never mind. I&#8217;ll give you two extra skewers&#8230; and I&#8217;ll return your payment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he said that, he handed me new skewers and the money, but I shook my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, keep the money. I bought them because I wanted to eat them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing that I wouldn&#8217;t take the money back, the stall owner backed off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;If that&#8217;s the case, I understand. But these two skewers are my way of expressing gratitude. You&#8217;ll accept them, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded at the stall owner&#8217;s words and gratefully accepted. I found a nearby bench to sit on and handed Ilmina a skewer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Here. This Whitebird meat is really delicious. Especially when it&#8217;s grilled like this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I nodded, I asked Ilmina, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you usually eat things like this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I usually eat more vegetables&#8230; and I haven&#8217;t had many chances to eat street food like this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then today, we have to eat a lot of things you&#8217;ve never tried before.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a smile, Ilmina accepted the skewer and took a bite after watching me eat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s delicious!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently being more tastier than she expected, Ilmina&#8217;s eyes sparkled as she continued to eat. The two of us finished our skewers quickly, and I returned the metal skewers to the stall owner. The taste was just like what I had in Waxe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was delicious, thank you. By the way, is there anyone in the city of Waxe in Glicente who makes the same grilled skewers?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you know my master?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed they had a teacher-student relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, I ate at his place before. The taste reminded me of that, so I got curious.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m still far from reaching my master&#8217;s level, but it&#8217;s good to know that I&#8217;m starting to capture his flavor.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah. Your skewers are just as good, if not better.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Knowing that you think so makes me feel like my hard work is paying off. Come and eat here again. I&#8217;ll give you a special service.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll stop by again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I replied to the stall owner and left the place. I met up with Ilmina, who was waiting on the bench, and we resumed walking through the city, buying and eating various foods from every stall we spotted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, I&#8217;ve never eaten this before.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then let&#8217;s try it next.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we knew it, we had conquered most of the food stalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Phew, I feel like we ate a lot.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah. Even though each dish wasn&#8217;t that big, it was surprisingly filling.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina agreed as she sat on the chair and rubbed her stomach. As we chatted on the bench, I sensed a familiar presence. Four of them, in fact. I couldn&#8217;t help but let out a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina tilted her head, looking at me curiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, it&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; I replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I were to tell Ilmina about the people following us, she&#8217;d become embarrassed, and it would be back to square one. So, I kept quiet. However, it&#8217;s interesting that they decided to tail us even after sending us off to have fun. It&#8217;s time to shake them off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shall we move on?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What should we do next?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We might find something interesting just by walking around, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s true.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Ilmina&#8217;s agreement, we resumed our walk. Of course, I always kept an eye on the presence behind us. Now, how should we lose them? Then I spotted the entrance to an alley. Checking the map, it seemed to connect to another street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ilmina, shall we go this way?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Into the alley?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina wore a questioning expression, but her face quickly turned red. What was she thinking?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Could it be that in a deserted street, you want to do&#8230; something indecent&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She totally misunderstood the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s not it at all! Why would you think that!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that not it? I thought you wanted to do something improper, so I was mentally preparing myself!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn&#8217;t decide whether to tell her the truth or not while holding my head in my hands. In the end, I decided to deceive her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I just mentioned it because it connects to another main street. Sorry for making you misunderstand. We can take a different route if you prefer&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, it&#8217;s my fault for not understanding your intentions, Haruto! I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m not bothered by it, but what do you want to do?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go through the alley if it&#8217;s a shortcut.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina&#8217;s face was still slightly red as we went through the alley together. Despite being an alley, it wasn&#8217;t dirty, just a bit narrow. Once we emerged, we found ourselves on a completely different-looking main street, lined with neat shops selling clothes and accessories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every time we change locations, the scenery changes too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It really does.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is there anything you want?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, not particularly&#8230; Oh, I just remembered! Didn&#8217;t everyone have something around their necks?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, those are the accessories I bought and gave them on our first day here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought I saw a shadow fall over Ilmina&#8217;s expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was planning to buy something for you too, Ilmina. Want to go inside a shop?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you sure!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina looked happy. Relieved, I took a breath and checked whether the familiar group of four were still following us. They were. Since they hadn&#8217;t left the alley yet, we quickly entered a shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four people Haruto noticed were Iris, Asha, Suzuno, and Ephyr. There was a reason Finne hadn&#8217;t come. She figured she&#8217;d be caught tailing them, and didn&#8217;t want to disturb their fun in the first place. Incidentally, Kuzel was taken to a bookstore by Zero, while Gawain and the Holy Knights were training at the cathedral after their encounter. Finne, who happened to be at the castle, was doing the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris and the others were still in the same spot, their voices hushed as they engaged in an argument that was barely audible over the ambient sounds around them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Iris, at this rate, they&#8217;re going to notice us. We should just go back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why are you so scared, Asha? You&#8217;re curious too, that&#8217;s why you came along!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s&#8230; uh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Asha’s eyes darted around, Suzuno and Ephyr joined in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Besides, we&#8217;re curious about what Haruto might do with Ilmina.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Exactly. This is an important responsibility as a fiancée!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Haruto was listening in, he would probably argue with the two girls&#8217; statements. With their conversation going on behind her, Iris kept her eyes on Haruto and Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ilmina seems even happier than usual.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Indeed. We&#8217;ll have to spoil her even more when we get back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes! Just as Suzuno said!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As expected of Suzuno!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Iris and Ephyr praising Suzuno, Asha sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, they&#8217;re moving. Let&#8217;s go, but make sure our presence is concealed!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two girls, with a determined thumbs up, and Asha, who was both exasperated and obedient, resumed tailing Haruto. In the midst of this, Iris&#8217;s mouth watered as she watched Haruto and the others eating skewers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Iris, are you hungry?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not! It&#8217;s not like my stomach is empty or anything!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Iris denied Suzuno&#8217;s words, a cute growling sound echoed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I knew it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I thought so too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Indeed&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha, Suzuno, and Ephyr let out resigned sighs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lady Iris, didn&#8217;t you just eat breakfast earlier?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course I did! I eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner without fail!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How many pieces of bread did you eat this morning?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;About six, I guess.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How can you still be hungry after eating that much&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha was at a loss for words. Iris&#8217; eyes sparkled, as she came up with a seemingly brilliant idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s it! We don&#8217;t have to take our eyes off Haruto and Ilmina, so let&#8217;s have fun ourselves!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a self-satisfied grin, Iris seemed to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m such a genius, aren&#8217;t I?&#8221; However, no one seemed to agree with her suggestion, or so Asha thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s true, just tailing them isn&#8217;t fun, is it~&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to her expectation, Suzuno agreed with Iris&#8217;s proposal. Asha and Ephyr looked at Suzuno with puzzled expressions. Then, noticing their gaze and expressions, Suzuno spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I mean, with such a delicious smell wafting over, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a &#8220;you understand, right?&#8221; expression, Suzuno continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grabbing the hesitant Asha and Ephyr by their arms, Iris headed towards the food stalls.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24095" src="https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Stalkers.jpeg?resize=688%2C1010&#038;ssl=1" alt width="688" height="1010" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Stalkers.jpeg?w=688&amp;ssl=1 688w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Stalkers.jpeg?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Stalkers.jpeg?resize=660%2C969&amp;ssl=1 660w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Stalkers.jpeg?resize=66%2C96&amp;ssl=1 66w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha and Ephyr also understood that arguing with Iris would be fruitless, so they decided that if they were discovered, they would blame Iris and Suzuno for their failed tailing attempt. From that point on, Iris and the others enjoyed the street food while keeping an eye on Haruto and Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This skewer is delicious!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, miss, you have good taste. Here, have an extra one as a bonus.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris happily munched on the skewers with both hands. Of course, Suzuno, Asha, and Ephyr also joined in, enjoying the food and exclaiming, &#8220;This is really tasty!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In between bites, they would suddenly remember they were tailing Haruto and Ilmina and scramble to locate them, only to be lured back by the delicious smells and buy more food. This cycle continued until Ephyr, who had narrowly noticed Haruto and Ilmina slipping into an alley, reported it to the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto just disappeared into an alley!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?! We need to follow them quickly!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What could Haruto and Ilmina be planning in that alley?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lady Iris, let&#8217;s hurry up and follow them instead of eating!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four of them followed Haruto and Ilmina into the alley, but&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh? They&#8217;re not here&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Suzuno had said, there was no sign of Haruto and Ilmina. Although the main street lay beyond the alley, the two were nowhere to be seen within view from their current location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s move on for now!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Iris&#8217;s words, everyone nodded and exited the alley to the main street. But there was still no sign of Haruto and Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did&#8230; did we lose them&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems so. If only Lady Iris hadn&#8217;t stopped to eat along the way&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wait, Asha?! You&#8217;re blaming me?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please consider, if you hadn&#8217;t been hungry, we wouldn&#8217;t have lost sight of them, would we?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh, well, that&#8217;s true&#8230; but you also started saying you wanted to eat something too, Asha!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ha&#8230; I have no counter argument for that&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Suzuno couldn&#8217;t help but chuckle since both parties were to blame. From a certain point, all four of them had enjoyed the food at the stalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go back to the inn.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah. I&#8217;m pretty full now, anyway.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Same here, my stomach is full.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Iris, Asha, Suzuno, and Ephyr agreed to return to the inn.</span></p>
