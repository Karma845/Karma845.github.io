<h2>Chapter 13 &#8211; Fierce Battle Showdown!</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufufu, it’s my win.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chains were severed and I fell to the ground, Schwartz laughed as he looked around the holy city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now then, how about I slowly make my way through the holy city&#8230;? That&#8217;s weird, why is the barrier still intact?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No way——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, that&#8217;s right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the sound of my voice from behind him, Schwartz turned around and looked astonished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there I was, standing in one piece.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;? How are you fine?! I watched you fall just now——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he said that, he turned his gaze toward my feet and saw my body crumble and scattered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I see, so that&#8217;s how it is. That thing that fell is some kind of puppet made from magic power. But what’s more surprising is that even the wounds are now clean and gone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What can I say, I’m good with recovery magic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those weren’t wounds that could be healed by some random recovery magic though&#8230;but that&#8217;s all right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz seemed to understand the trick I had pulled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment I was cut, I fell while performing basic recovery on myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the minute Schwartz took his eyes off me, I used my magic power to create a puppet that looked like me, while I moved behind him while recovering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s unfortunate that I couldn’t finish you off with that blow earlier, but this battle is far from over!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then said coldly to Schwartz, who leapt backward and braced himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, it’s over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wrapped my sword in light magic, using enough magic power to annihilate Schwartz, and swung it at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz laughed happily as the blow came close enough to bury him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufufu, so you still have such a card up your sleeve this late! Still, it’s not enough to end this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time as he said these words, pitch-black magic power surged out from Schwartz with tremendous force, striking the heavens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sheer force of it drowned out the slash I fired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And at the same time, Ellis issued a warning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;It seems that Schwartz has acquired the skill Limit Break.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say what?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was still dumbfounded, the magic power that had been rising from Schwartz was being absorbed into his body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His left arm also regenerated, and although his appearance was no different from before, the magic power contained inside him had become enormous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufufu, so this is Limit Break. I can’t help but feel like I’ve become stronger than you right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While glaring at Schwartz, who was smiling happily, I analyzed both of our strengths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fuck me, he really wasn’t bluffing when he said that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellis, honestly, how does it look?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;At this point, you are evenly matched in terms of ability, and at the same time, Master is expected to reach the limit of your current combat potential in about five more minutes. Frankly speaking, the odds are fifty-fifty.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I&#8217;m weakened by the barrier, I too am running on Limit Break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now Schwartz has gained the same level of power as me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I wasn’t weakened, I would have wiped the floor with him without breaking a sweat&#8230;forget it, no use bitchin’ over it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At any rate, I guess I&#8217;d better get this over with as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was thinking about this, Schwartz launched his arm at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Devil&#8217;s Claw!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz&#8217;s slash was more powerful than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I blocked it with Aegis, but the impact was greater than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was just testing it out. I see, this is wonderful! Still, it doesn&#8217;t look like I’ll be able to destroy that defensive barrier of yours.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That, you can bet your ass. It won’t be funny at all, if you could.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufufu, I suppose that also makes it fun. But——looks like you won’t be able to hold out for much longer!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that Schwartz is aware that my Limit Break will be wearing off soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded my head when he pointed it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, you’re right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And here I thought you’d deny it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not like you’d believe me if I lied, and besides, you’re already aware of it, are you not?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz nodded, and the next moment he was swinging his claws over my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I immediately braced myself, with my arms covered in Diamond, but was blown away by the impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took another fist to the gut as a follow-up blow, and coughed up blood from my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I managed to create some distance between us, but&#8230;it’s not looking good, he’s obviously buffed up on speed and power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For you to still be able to keep up with my current movements, are you really human?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz&#8217;s eyes widened in genuine surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, I am now a “High Human”, a species that has an upper ability limit far above that of a “Human” and can easily acquire skills and magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Schwartz only knows of my fake status, and does not know that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I began to use recovery magic and smiled at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmph, maybe I’m more than just a human?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In that case, what are you then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good question. I&#8217;ll tell you if you defeat——me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I channeled magic power into my black sword and released a slash, but it was canceled by a slash from his claws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I unleashed several slashes, but the result remained the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Master. The effect of Limit Break will wear off in one minute.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellis informed me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I won’t be able to defeat Schwartz at this rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And here I thought I had become stronger. I never thought I would be cornered and pushed to this extent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz, looking at me getting flustered, jumped up high and raised one hand to the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, an enormous amount of magic power gathered near his arm</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh no, you don’t!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He must be planning to use large-scale magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried climbing altitude to stop him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I won’t let you get in my way! Summon Devil’s Gate! ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz pointed his other hand at me, and this time summoned five devils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Keep him away from me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““““Yes sir!”””””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I brandished a single slash of my blade clad in light magic at the devil&#8217;s closing in on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That took out three of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Twenty seconds left.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ellis informed me how much time I had left, I unleashed another combined spell of light and fire magic, annihilating the remaining two devils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“NOT HAPPENINNNNNNG!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I finally approached Schwartz and swung my sword at him, then——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Limit Break has worn off!&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt the power drain from my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hardly managed to maintain my balance and fell to my knees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh, I was so damn close&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Such a shame, but it ends now. Though I have to admit fighting with you has allowed me to climb to even greater heights. You have my gratitude.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz activated his magic right in front me, and a huge magic circle was formed in the night sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as soon as the magic circle was completed, I felt as if the magic power in my body was being sucked out of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed that the magic circle was absorbing my magic power, and that of the people in the holy city below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magic circle holding the magic power gathered from all over the holy city was probably the cause, as Detect Danger called for utmost vigilance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Master, danger detected! That magic has the power to annihilate the entire surrounding area!&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gritted my teeth at the sound of Ellis&#8217; unusually panicked voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damn it! Move, move, move goddammit!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried getting my body to move, but the backlash from using Limit Break wouldn’t let me move a finger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They depend on me to protect them. And unless I defeat this sunnavabitch, I’ll be reneging on my promise to Iris!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, I told Finne and the others that “I&#8217;ll take care of it”, and that “I&#8217;ll come back”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like hell I’m croakin’ out here——muddafucka!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just after I thought so firmly, the sensation of my magic power getting sucked out of me disappeared, and my strength returned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;——!? Master&#8217;s inner magic power is rapidly expanding. It&#8217;s even more explosive than Limit Break&#8230;is this?!&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellis reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as the magic power within me continued to grow——my vision turned crimson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this&#8230;the sign of power overflowing from my body?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, for the first time in a while, I heard the Voice of the World.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;You have acquired the skill &lt;Extreme Break&gt;.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps this skill has something to do with the recovery of my magic power and physical strength&#8230;well, I’ll check that out later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Fuckin’ hell!? What the devil just happened?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz couldn’t hide his surprise at the sudden and explosive increase in my magic power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a suffocating presence!! But unfortunately the magic is already completed!“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Schwartz said this, the collected magic power gathered to the center of the magic circle, and it turned black and ominous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Schwartz chanted the magic spell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Cruel End.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magic power stirring at the center of the magic circle was unleashed with Schwartz&#8217;s words as the trigger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The black magic swirled like a dragon as it approached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Devour all of him!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the overwhelming magic power closed in, I stared at the city below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And saw the people with expressions of despair on their faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them was Ilmina, clasping her hands and looking up at me as if praying for my victory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain and Liebert were also praying for my victory in the face of the approaching despair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t betray their wishes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put my beloved sword back in its sheath and infused as much of my current magic power into it as I could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then unleashed a flash of my blade at the menace that was already pretty close at hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An extremely rapid quick draw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blade traveled silently, without any slashes flying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jet-black dragon, which was about to swallow me, was cut in two without making any sound at all, and disappeared as if it were evaporating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the magic circle split in two as if the cut surface was spreading, and the weakening barrier covering the holy city began to crumble with a sharp sound like the shattering of glass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz didn’t seem to understand what had happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because his best move and barrier had been cut apart with nothing but a single blade strike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-It can’t be. To think that my personally created ultimate magic would crumble from just a single blow&#8230;you truly are a monster through and through.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing those words, I retracted my sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A high-pitched click sound echoed through the silent space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;What?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something also happened to Schwartz&#8217;s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sword line ran through his torso and slowly began to disappear from his feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That blow had cut Schwartz as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Fufufuu, so that’s how it is. You already killed me in that instant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right. You will never be able to resurrect again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I already knew that. To have been cut down to my soul, even I cannot survive that&#8230;I just didn’t expect to meet my end in a place like this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz laughed as if poking fun at himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I accept my defeat. But before I die, may I ask you something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How did you manage to become so strong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I answer Schwartz&#8217;s question, who had almost disappeared up to his waist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At first, I sought power to keep myself from dying. But now&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about now I wonder?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">——It&#8217;s obvious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To protect the ones I care about, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz had a satisfied expression after hearing my answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One last thing? What exactly are you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I answered Schwartz&#8217;s question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m——just an otherworlder who got summoned, although my species right now says I’m a High Human.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise, but he immediately laughed, “Fufufuu”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That explains it&#8230;so you’re a High Human. No wonder you’re so strong. Your actual level is over 400, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s right. After exchanging so many blows, you must have noticed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then it occurred to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“May I ask you something too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you know anything about High Humans?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to ask him if he had any information about them, since they were a species that were already extinct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I fought one a long time ago. I was young at the time, and fought alongside several other devils, and only then were we able to get the upper hand enough to defeat one&#8230;well, if I were to fight him again now, I don’t see myself losing though. Anyway, is that all for your question?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then as promised.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying this, Schwartz tossed over the sinister-looking sword he had just wielded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, I felt as if it was draining my power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The name of that sword is ‘Nigrum, the Underworld Sword’. It has a few quirks, but it’s a very powerful sword if you can handle it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for your generosity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we exchanged such words, Schwartz had disappeared down to his arms and shoulders, leaving only the top of his neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I guess this is it. I am very happy and proud to have fought with you as my last opponent&#8230;now, so long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that simple remark, Schwartz disappeared completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I saw this, my Extreme Limit state was lifted, and I felt completely weakened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel like I’mma pass out if I&#8217;m not careful. This is definitely a first..oh right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I undid Aegis below me and put the sword Schwartz gave me away in the dimensional storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I managed to maintain Sky Walk and slowly descended down to the cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I noticed something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people below were all looking up at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Master. The people seem to be waiting for you to declare victory.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, is that what it is? Well, sure, why not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I raised my beloved blade to the heavens and declared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——We’ve claimed victory!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a moment of silence, the whole of the holy city erupted in joy.</span></p>
