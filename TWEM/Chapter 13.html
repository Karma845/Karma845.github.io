<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; You Can Never Be Too Prepared</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A week after the opening of the business, I was holding an emergency meeting at the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only the employees, but also Sebas, Lyla, Mia, Zero and other servants of the mansion as well as Tendo and the other heroes had gathered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to have you get together all of a sudden. There&#8217;s something I need to tell you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told everyone about the incident on the morning of the first day of business, and that the viscount is a troublesome character, and how likely there is to be an attack in retaliation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I figured the harassment would begin immediately, but so far nothing has happened. I was in the store for the past week, so I didn&#8217;t say anything because I thought I could handle it if something happened, but that won&#8217;t be the case from now on. That&#8217;s why I am holding this meeting today to give y’all a heads up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the whole place started buzzing, but I put a stop to it with a wave of my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know you are anxious, but who do you think is standing in front of you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The room became quiet with those words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t have to worry about me getting killed. There may be an attack on the store, but you are strong enough to defend yourselves. I&#8217;ve taught you how to defend yourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a pause, I continued.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-25843731' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-25843731' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have only one thing to say to you—show no mercy to your enemies! That&#8217;s all I have to say.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I finished, the employees responded with a resounding, “Roger”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting was then dismissed, and the employees returned to their quarters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, I decided to have a discussion with Finne, Iris, Sebas, Lyla, and Mia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas is a former S-rank adventurer, and Lyla and Mia are former assassins. They should be familiar with the underground society of this country like assassination organizations and similar, so I thought it prudent to have them involved in this discussion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I gotta say, I’m a little disappointed that there has been no movement this past week. The fact that he hasn’t made any moves means that he is probably up to something&#8230;Sebas, if they were to say, try to assassinate me, do you have any idea who they would contract?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well&#8230;there certainly are a lot of assassins who make a living on their trade, but if there were to be an attack this time around, it would likely be from the assassination group&#8230;Cobra!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cobra?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right. It’s a huge organization of assassins, the full extent of which is still unknown in the country, and is marked as the most notorious criminal group. The members at the bottom of the organization are not worth mentioning, but the executives are all very powerful making it a formidable organization.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interesting, there&#8217;s an organization like that&#8230;hmm?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Have you ever fought the Cobra, Sebas?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked him, since his tone was somewhat regretful.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas answered with a downcast look in his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Yes. When I had just risen to the S rank, there was information that their hideout had been found, so I joined the subjugation team.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see, so that’s when you had a run-in with them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. However it turned out to be a dummy hideout, and the executives were waiting to intercept the subjugation team. After a fierce battle, we defeated them, but in the process, our comrades&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I’m sorry, for making you dredge up such painful memories.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh please, not at all. But if there’s going to be a clash, may I come with you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I answered immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure&#8230;still, is Cobra that strong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. It was a few decades ago, and I was a young man who had just become an S rank, but I had a very hard time with them&#8230;I don&#8217;t know how good they are now, but you can never be too careful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s all I need to know. Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see. An executive equivalent to an S rank&#8230;I think that&#8217;s a bit much for everyone right now, perhaps?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the actual fight against Cobra, I guess it would be better to have Zero accompany me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I was thinking this, there was a knock at the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you have a minute, Master Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, come on in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero and Noir opened the door and entered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m here to tell you that your bath is ready.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, Zero&#8230;by the way, Sebas, how would you score Zero’s current capability as a butler?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess&#8230;I would say about ninety points. I could even give him a perfect score.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoa, a high evaluation, how surprising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And there you have it, Zero.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero had a look on his face as if to say, “No way!”. Was it that surprising?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m—I mean, I still have a long way to go as a butler.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-11766720' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-11766720' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He even corrected his wording, he seems very serious about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere became relaxed due to Zero&#8217;s appearance, so I decided to give out a new set of instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lyla, Mia, and Noir, I have a job for you. Find out everything you can about Cobra and the piggy Viscount.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about Sebas’ words the other way around, simply means that we should have no problem dealing with anyone other than Cobra, as long as we remain vigilant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as for Cobra, it would be prudent to probe for information and exercise the utmost caution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even knowing that the government is having a hard time with them, if that’s the case, I might as well do them a favor and quash them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s best to nip dangerous buds like this early on before they become a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my words, Lyla, Mia, and Noir immediately became expressionless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes sir. Then, we&#8217;ll get right on it and report back by morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lyla answered on behalf of the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m counting on you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former assassins, and former black ops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three of them were perfect for espionage work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh right. Here, take this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It suddenly came to my mind and I took a pitch-black outfit out of my storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, what&#8217;s this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne asked before Lyla and the others, perhaps it piqued her interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a combat maid uniform I made for the three of them. It fits automatically to the size of the body with mana input, and is also equipped with a repair function, it’s also incomparable to the usual maid uniforms with how comfy it is to move in. And it’s impervious to weapons, say like an ordinary iron sword or the like.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I handed it to the three of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you very much. I, Lyla, swear loyalty to you, Master Haruto, for the rest of my life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Likewise, I, Mia, also swear loyalty to you for the rest of my life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two got on their knees having declared so. Noir, who had already pledged her allegiance, also knelt next to Mia in the same manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I suppose, you can count me in as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Sebas followed suit, kneeling and bowing his head.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I accept your pledges. Keep up the good work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““““Yes, sir!””””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, while at it, I should give the four of them something&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought about what would be most suitable, and then pulled a few weapons out of my storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I shall give these to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I presented them with six short one-handed swords and one long one-handed sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were all weapons I had made in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gave Lyla, Mia, and Noir two short one-handed swords each, and Sebas the long one-handed sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lyla, Mia, and Noir, I’m counting on you three, got it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three nodded vigorously and quickly exited the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After dinner that day, we were all chillin’ over a cup of tea when I noticed Kusel staring at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I’m to guess&#8230;she probably wants to have a mock battle or something like that anyway~.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was so sure that’s what it was, but I tried asking just in case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, um. Recently, I have been training not only with Sir Tendo and the others, but also with Zero and Sebas. I wanted you to have a mock battle with me to see how strong I have become&#8230;I know you are busy with the trading company and all, but I would really appreciate a spar with you, Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was right on point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I don&#8217;t think my presence is needed at the store anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the first day, all the employees had gotten used to serving customers, and were doing their jobs quite smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For tomorrow, I think I&#8217;ll have just the employees run the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh really? Then should we do it tomorrow?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said that, Kusel&#8217;s eyes lit up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you for real?! Definitely!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-12153458' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-12153458' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-Okay. How about Finne and Iris, wanna join?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While trying to pull away from the enthusiasm, I asked them if they would like to participate in the mock battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes! I&#8217;d love to!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too! I&#8217;m going to try out my newly developed ace move on you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Count me in, Haruto!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne, Iris, and even Suzuno all seemed interested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also tried asking Zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What about you, Zero?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With your permission, I&#8217;d be happy to try my hand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I thought as much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, there’s a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Zero and I were to have a mock battle, there was a good chance the yard would become a waste ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I guess I’ll build an arena or something in the basement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided that it would be better to build one, since it’d probably come in handy for Tendo and the others, as well as the employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having made up my mind, I quickly got up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? You&#8217;re going to make one? Now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded in response to Iris&#8217;s question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean a mock battle between me and Zero in the garden. Will probably destroy half of the capital, wouldn’t it? If the barriers were to break inadvertently while we were fighting each other with all our might, it would be a catastrophe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I see your point&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all agreed with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right then, while the idea is still fresh in my mind&#8230;fellas, I’m off to go remodel the basement. You guys can just go do your thing. And look forward to the outcome tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I left the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I headed for the basement of the mansion while putting my hand on my chin pondering what to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the rooms in the basement were in use, so it would be a hassle to move things out of the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being the case, I could just dig another floor below ground, but then I’d be faced with another underlying problem regarding capacity. Like how far down can I dig&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then it came to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build a staircase leading to the basement, and at some point down, create a door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you open the door, it would lead to a subspace with a spacious arena&#8230;problem solved!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent someone from getting lost inside, the door should be mana-authenticated, so that it can only be opened by the magic power of the person who set it up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly created a subspace and a door leading to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also quickly developed the magic power authentication function, and all that was left was designing the subspace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more mana I put into it, the wider it would be, but there was no need to go too far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arena will be a square 500 meters on the sides, create spectator seats around it, reinforce them to the maximum extent possible, and finally put up barriers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will not cause any damage to the audience unless it’s something really extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can&#8217;t wait to see everyone’s reaction tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early morning the next day. Before breakfast, I received reports from Lyla, Mia, and Noir about Cobra and the piggy viscount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly gathered everyone to come listen in on the report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When everyone had gathered in the dining room, Lyla spoke up first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you familiar with the number of great merchant associations in the capital, Master Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a trading company grows to a certain size and influence, it is called a great merchant association.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh, I believe there are less than twenty, aren&#8217;t there?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-90116031' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-90116031' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mia nodded at my answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Correct. Eighteen, to be exact.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered what this had to do with anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of them is owned by Viscount Berkshire, and according to our investigation, we have discovered that there are connections between the seven great merchant associations, including that one and the one owned by the Count. There is nothing strange about that in itself, but it seems that when a store comes along and poses a threat to them, they try to sabotage and destroy its business. One of their tactics seems to have been to contract Cobra&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That piggy, was he connected to the Count?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is the Count&#8217;s name?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lyla, not Mia, answered my question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An individual that goes by the name Almuth Balazel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is the name of his trading company?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Balazel Trading Company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I bet the boss of the Seven chambers of commerce is that guy called alphabet or whatever, given his position. Any one or all of the seven trading associations could be connected to Cobra.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““It’s Almuth.”””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lyla, Mia, and Noir corrected my mistake with the name at the same time. I, of course, ignored it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our store’s sales are growing steadily. They may have been quiet at first, but with this piggy viscount matter now, I won’t be surprised if they started to make their move.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I agree.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne nodded her head in agreement with me.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We should either take the initiative and make the first move, or set a trap for them&#8230;one or the other.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was thinking about which would be better, Sebas spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think setting a trap is the better option.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“May I ask why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure. The opponents are genuine nobles, even if they’re rotten pieces of shit. And we don&#8217;t have any clear evidence yet. So mounting an attack unilaterally is a bad idea. Instead, it would be better to set them up. If we catch the assailants and make them tell us who gave them the order, then we will have good justifications.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas is right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;I agree with Sebas.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You too, Ellis? Then let&#8217;s do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right then, a set up it is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What kind of setup do you have in mind?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Count Haguetezzo, who is in a prominent position will probably not be the first to make a move. Because if he fails, he will be met with harsh judgments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““It’s Almuth. Are you doing it on purpose?”””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ignored them again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lyla and the others’ temples seemed to be twitching, but I didn’t care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;If they are indeed connected, they will likely contract Cobra. Their objective would be to steal the technology to make the toilets, our main product, or kill the employees to slow down production, or perhaps more straight to the point, kill me—and be done with it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The assassination of Master Haruto would undoubtedly be the most significant loss for the Ashtaroth Chamber of Commerce, wouldn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Definitely, especially since Viscount piggy is so desperate to kill me now that I’ve ruined his reputation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne gave me a look as if to ask why are you taking such grave life-threatening matters so nonchalantly, but I brushed that aside as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well&#8230;I can’t really call it a plan, but if I go into a back alley or something by myself, won’t they attack me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, that’s dangerous—I mean, a good idea. Then if only the assassin could just attack heedlessly, everything would be perfect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other members of the group agreed with Lyla.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;She doesn’t seem to be worried about me one bit, and even hoping that I, her master, will be attacked heedlessly, isn’t that too horrible?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted someone to worry about me and almost cried a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, we had breakfast and headed for the underground arena.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at it, I brought Zero, Sebas, Lyla, Mia, Noir, and the other servants along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four of them, except for Zero, knew about my subspace, but they had never experienced it, so they were surprised to the point of having their eyeballs popped out of their sockets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero was also surprised, even though he had created a similar space himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“M-Master Haruto. How is it so wide? And even though we’re underground, the sky is&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm? Well, it’s a separate dimension I put together in a snap.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““““You say it as if you’re making light breakfast!”””””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was just answering Noir&#8217;s question, but I was barraged with snappy retorts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, since Finne and the others already knew about my subspace ability, they were not that surprised and only smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was a little sad when I didn&#8217;t get any reaction from them.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-25677958' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-25677958' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas, Lyla, Mia, and Noir returned above-ground because they had work to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now then, shall we get started?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right, let&#8217;s get on with it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris was getting worked up, but I have to keep the order we agreed to yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m going to start with Kusel first. We had an agreement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;That&#8217;s true, I&#8217;ll wait my turn.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris readily backed down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned to Kusel, feeling bad about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, are you ready?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You bet I am! My body is already on fire! Now draw your weapon!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel’s statement was a bit of a stretch, but no doubt she seemed eager to battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m convinced that it’s because she’s a battle maniac by nature. I always wondered how she was able to make deputy knight captain with that kind of disposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suddenly pictured a knight under her lying on the ground battered, and Kusel smiling broadly with hands on her hips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Wow, I could almost see that happening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having had enough, I put the image out of my head and took out an iron sword from the dimensional storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I were to use my beloved sword, she could end up dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel understood this, and without saying a word, turned her back on me and headed to the center of the arena.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason she seemed to be trembling though&#8230;I didn&#8217;t offend her or anything, did I? She’s probably just super excited, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned to Finne and the others, thinking, she’s kinda scary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You guys can watch from the spectator’s stand. Iris, you’re next after this, so just be patient for a bit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, I already agreed to wait my turn. Thank you, Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris smiled and moved with everyone to the stand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making sure everyone had moved over and sat down in the spectator’s stand, I too headed to the center, drew my weapon, and faced Kusel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m ready whenever you are—is what I’d like to say, but I’m guessing the match has already started the moment we walked in here&#8230;isn’t that right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. Damn right—it has!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel approached at a tremendous speed. She must have applied a physical boost instantaneously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her speed was nearly twice as fast as she had displayed in our last mock battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel slashed at me with a reverse diagonal slash, which I avoided by stepping backward&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, so it’s a slash attack!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her mana reshaped into a slash attack and came flying at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me see how you avoid this at this distance!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel was right, it would be impossible for a normal person to avoid it. However—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, I was caught by surprise, but what makes you think I can’t avoid it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stepped on the air with my Sky Walk skill and leaped up at once to avoid the slash.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But you can’t move while you’re in the—air!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having found my landing point, Kusel swung her sword, but it never reached me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come on, you should know by now that it won’t be that easy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shot up further into the air with Sky Walk and looked down at Kusel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh, then—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flames wrapped around Kusel’s sword with a frustrated expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take this, Fire Slash!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A blade made of flames flew toward me from her sword. It&#8217;s like a flame version of the previous slash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, I then wrapped water around my sword and swung it at the incoming flaming slash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Water Slash!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flaming slash and the aqueous slash collided, and both were extinguished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, Kusel did not stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Fireball!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, dozens of fireballs appeared near Kusel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, to think she is able to control that many now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Get him!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Kusel’s words as the cue, the fireballs darted toward me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, some of them were moving erratically, clearly Kusel was controlling them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, I utilized Sky Walk to duck the fireballs, cut them with my sword, and punch them with my fist to extinguish them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even as I was doing so, Kusel was churning out more fireballs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was getting me nowhere, so I landed on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ve been waiting for that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel shouted the moment I landed on the ground, and both the fireballs that had been prepared on standby and the fireballs that had been pursuing me all rushed toward me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How naive! —Water Wall!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wall of water formed around me. The fireballs that flew into it disappeared one after another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When all the fireballs were gone and the water wall was disengaged—Kusel, who must have used the skill Berserk Switch and the unique skill Trance, came running at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both skills were similar in the sense that you get a boost in stats in exchange for losing rationality. Meaning that her speed became even faster than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holy fuck!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took her on with my sword clad in ice, but the double application of that skill and unique skill granted an astonishing boost to her strength stat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I unexpectedly was about to be pushed and held on, the weight of the sword vanished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel had let go of her sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see, so that’s what you’re trying to do!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also let go of my sword as quickly as I could and deflected Kusel&#8217;s right fist with my right hand, which was just inches away from my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grabbed her by the wrist, hooked her leg to topple her down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s put an end to this already. There are others in the queue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn, it&#8230;”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-34119416' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-34119416' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then struck Kusel, who was lying on her back in the gut with my palm heel, and knocked her out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel, who was still passed out, woke up after a while with a recovery spell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s hopeless. I can’t even see any hope of victory against you, Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you talking about? You gave me quite a few surprises, you know? Especially when you let go of your sword and tried to make it a melee fight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh really. Actually, there was a brief moment when I regained consciousness from my berserk state, and it was at that exact moment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow, regaining consciousness from that berserk state&#8230;that’s a feat even I am not confident I could pull off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was surprised by that and many other things. You certainly have become even stronger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m glad to hear that. And thanks for using recovery on me. If I ever get the chance, I&#8217;d love to have another go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, anytime. I pick up one or two things when I spar with you as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seriously. Hearing you say that just made my day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these words, Kusel went to the spectator&#8217;s seats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, Finne, Ephyr, and Suzuno came in together after Kusel exited the stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm? Four of you at once?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course! I&#8217;m rather weak you see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Exactly. So, you’ll be taking on all four of us at once.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ones who replied to me were Iris and Finne.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Ephyr and Suzuno also opened their mouths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto. If you’d please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, you better not underestimate our coordination!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ohh. This should be fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus began the match—which ended after fifteen minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result was my overwhelming victory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Suzuno was right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris and Finne in the vanguard, and Ephyr and Suzuno in the rearguard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were quite well coordinated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever I tried to move, magic attacks would come flying at me. And when I prepared for a magic attack, the vanguard would attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was good practice for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also had a mock battle with Tendo and the others, which was also decided in about fifteen minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Suzuno, who usually plays the role of healer, was out of the picture, their battle formation was well-balanced, with Tendo playing the double role of damage dealer and healer, Mogami as the tank, Shinonome as the vanguard ranger, and Asakura as the rearguard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps this is all thanks to their experience at the labyrinth, they are clearly much stronger, with more rigorous attacks and coordination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that’s left now is my spar with Zero&#8230;from an onlooker’s perspective, it must have been a battle between monsters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each blow had the power to kill, and from the point of view of Finne and the others, just a graze would result in instant death. Such attacks were being exchanged back and forth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the spectators’ stands were protected by barriers, it must have been terrifying to watch at such close range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps it was because the aftermath alone shook the atmosphere and transmitted vibrations to the barriers, but then from the latter half, everyone&#8217;s cheeks began wobbling.</span></p>
