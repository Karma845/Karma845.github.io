<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Intermission – Yururu Garethia [A]</h2>
<p>The sound of swords clashing echoed repeatedly. This morning, Fay and Yururu were sparring as per usual. Although they appeared to be evenly matched, that was actually not the case at all, and Fay’s sword was knocked into the air.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Tch.”　</p>
<p>“…You’ve grown stronger.”</p>
<p>“Fuhn, I can only hear that as sarcasm seeing as how I got beaten down like this.”</p>
<p>“No, I had no such intentions… you really are growing stronger.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Yururu said to Fay with a smile. However, the latter remained expressionless as usual, albeit with a slight frown.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Fay-kun, let’s take a break.”　</p>
<p>“Aah.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The two of them put down their swords and leaned against the tree to rest. Fay folded his arms and closed his eyes; being quiet and blind to the world in between spars was his selling point. If it was any other day, Yururu wouldn’t have talked to him unnecessarily.　</p>
<p>“U-uhm-“　</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>However, she spoke out to him in the spur of the moment today. Fay opened his eyes and glanced at her, causing Yururu to flush a little and look down.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“I-it’s about this…”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She gently presented him with a sandwich in a wooden box out of the bag.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“…What’s this?”　</p>
<p>“I-it&#8217;s breakfast. It just happened that I didn’t eat it in the morning… s-so, here you go.”</p>
<p>“…I see. Then I’ll take it.”</p>
<p>The sandwich was clearly made with certain intentions and was to be eaten by Fay. If it was any other man, having a person of the opposite gender present them with breakfast –and in Yururu’s case, she presented it with a flushed expression to boot– that man would likely understand the hidden intentions.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“H-how is it?”　</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not bad.”</p>
<p>“R-really?! Y-you’re not lying?!”</p>
<p>“Aah.”</p>
<p>“B-but, is there anything else you want to say?! P-please say anything. You may even request the flavor for…”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing in particular. It’s not bad, that’s all. Rather than that, you really don’t want to eat it?”</p>
<p>“Eh, ah, I-I, well… I don’t think I want to eat now…”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She looked down and said nothing. Yururu Garethia, who turned 23 this year, had never been in love before. She had spent her younger days training her swordsmanship, then the tragedy struck which switched her obsession to clearing her parents’ name.　</p>
<p>Although she was aware of the concept of love, she has never experienced it herself before.　</p>
<p>And she also had a personality which made her panic easily. Especially so as she was stepping into unknown territory for her 23 year old self to fall in love with her own 15 year old student.　</p>
<p>That was why she was feeling really panicked right now.　</p>
<p><em>Awawa, f-for me to draw his attention using this kind of blatant approach. A-am I a fool…?</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“I doubt that it’s the case, but… did you go out of your way to make it for me?”　</p>
<p>“…?! N-no, that’s not it! I just happened to have a stomachache today…”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>C-calm down. He is my student, and I am his instructor. I have to keep proper distance… Let’s change the topic…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“I am still a paladin thanks to Fay-kun. You allowed me to continue teaching you. So, once again, thank you very much.”　</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that. I need you; that’s all there is to it.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Due to the ridiculously suggestive words, Yururu looked down once again. She knew she couldn’t stay like this and hurriedly switched tracks for her train of thoughts.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“A-ah- even so, thanks to Fay-kun for keeping me from leaving, I’ve been enjoying my days. It makes me sad to think of what might have happened if you didn’t.”　</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Perhaps I might have gone to the free city with a dungeon.”</p>
<p>“I see. However, that option is not allowed.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“Even if you were expelled from the knights’ brigade, you will still be my swords instructor. Worst case scenario, I considered having you live in my room at the orphanage.”</p>
<p>“E-eeh?! B-but if you do that, it’ll cost money for my living expense-“</p>
<p>“I can just pay it with my wages. I calculated that I earn enough to pay you the tutoring fee and to cover your living expenses.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Her heart pounded hard. Yururu flushed red and covered her face with her hands while looking down completely.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“…Auau.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She couldn’t even form a coherent word as euphoria gushed through her. She felt that it was even worse because he said it with a serious expression, and she could tell that he really meant it.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“What is it?”　</p>
<p>“No-nothing…”</p>
<p>“…Let’s end it here for today.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“It seems like you’re enduring a lot right now. I doubt you can concentrate properly in that state. Besides, it should be tough for you to accompany me every day. Go home for today.”</p>
<p>“Ah, y-yes.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>T-there’s no way I can teach him properly anymore, not while pining like this… I think I can’t even look at his face properly right now…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>I wonder if Fay-kun noticed that the feeling I’m enduring right now is different… Uuh, this is so embarrassing.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Fay stood up as he told her that. He seemed to have no intention to continue his training today. She didn’t look at him due to how red her face was and only continued to hide behind her hands.</p>
<p>“F-Fay-kun. See-see you tomorrow.”　</p>
<p>“Aah.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>AAAAAAAAhhhhhh, this is embarassiiiiiinnngggg!</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>With that said, she buried her face a little more and left in a fierce dash as if escaping from the foot of the three trees.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">■◆</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Sensei, did your tummy hurt?　</em></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Such a thought ran through my mind as we did our morning training. I didn’t know why, but sensei averted her gaze whenever our eyes met during the training.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>And somehow, she seemed really panicked and fidgety today. Uh-n, but the image of sensei in my mind was that she was always panicking after all, so I didn’t think it was particularly weird after that.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She still said awawa despite being 23 years old. I could feel her usual panic and worry. Underlying all that, I also felt that sensei was somewhat nervous. Perhaps her tummy was hurting?　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Perhaps it felt so painful that she wanted to hurry and be done with training, but she couldn’t bring herself to say that directly to her disciple…　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Sensei said to take a break and gave me a sandwich. Ooh, I appreciate it. It grew tastier with every bite.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>But well, to be honest, Maria’s dishes were more… I shouldn’t say anymore.　</p>
<p>—Indeed, I was a protagonist who knew how to be considerate.　</p>
<p>Even so, why didn’t sensei eat it? It would be better if she ate as well. Was her tummy really hurting?　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“I doubt that it’s the case, but… did you go out of your way to make it for me?”　</p>
<p>“…?! N-no, that’s not it! I just happened to have a stomachache today…”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Ah- so her tummy really was hurting. So that was why she gave her portion to me. I thought of the possibility that she might be the heroine considering her reaction, but that didn’t seem to be the case. <span id="easy-footnote-1-20385" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-20385" title="T/N: Yururu missed her heroine&amp;#8217;s flag. Poor her. ED: the age gap tho…"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Hm? What if you ended up expelled? Hey, who would teach me swordsmanship if you were gone? I would pay you properly regardless, you know?　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It was normal to be paid for tutoring in Japan, so I don’t have any resistance to paying you for this. When I said that though, she looked down.　</p>
<p>W-was her tummy really in that pain…? Ah- sensei was a hard worker. She was recently told that she was about to be expelled after all. Perhaps she was trying to relieve her stress and gain a sense of familiarity by training me like this.　</p><div class="watas-d35ab016018ff450fd48346a2dc9f8cf watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-d35ab016018ff450fd48346a2dc9f8cf"></div>
<p>Then her tummy got hurt as a result?　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“What is it?”　</p>
<p>“N-nothing…”</p>
<p>“…Let’s end it here for today.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“It seems like you’re enduring a lot right now, I doubt you can concentrate properly in that state. Besides, it should be tough for you to accompany me every day. Go home for today.”</p>
<p>“Ah, y-yes.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>When I said that, sensei immediately said that training was done for the day, so I guess her tummy did feel really painful. She dashed right home after that too. I felt bad for forcing her to accompany me in that state.　</p>
<p>—Fuh, as expected of me. Because I was such a considerate protagonist, I was able to make a wise decision.</p>
<p>I didn’t know whether or not sensei noticed my consideration, but the master and disciple should naturally be considerate to each other. What a wonderful bond!!　</p>
<p>That’s right. I should buy her some good stomach medicine next time.　</p>

<p><strong>9    Anonymous God</strong><br>What is that person like? Details pls.</p>
<p><strong>10    Anonymous God</strong><br>No magical aptitude, but have sword talent. Also, his mentality is abnormal &lt;- this part is important one.</p>
<p><strong>11    Anonymous God</strong><br>Fuh-n</p>
<p><strong>12    Anonymous God</strong><br>Are you all talking about Fay-sama?</p>
<p><strong>13    Anonymous God</strong><br>Fay-sama (LOL).</p>

<p><strong>15    Anonymous God</strong><br>Who reincarnated him?</p>
<p><strong>16    Anonymous God</strong><br>It’s Athena, right?</p>
<p><strong>17    Anonymous God</strong><br>Hee, I’m getting curious.</p>
<p><strong>18    Anonymous God</strong><br>The dude was reincarnated as cannon fodder in an utsu novel game called “Round Table Heroes.” However, the person in question is doing protagonist RP without noticing it.</p>
<p><strong>19    Anonymous God</strong><br>Ah!! I know that novel game! I love that big tits loli Yururu-chan!</p>
<p><strong>20    Anonymous God</strong><br>>>19<br>She’s already taken by Fay (LOL).</p>
<p><strong>21    Anonymous God</strong><br>>>20<br>Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>22    Anonymous God　</strong><br>>>21<br>Seriously. She totally fell for him. I think she wouldn’t hate it even if he asks for a physical relationship.</p>
<p><strong>23    Anonymous God</strong><br>But well, that one just can’t be helped.</p>
<p><strong>24    Anonymous God</strong><br>He’s so quick with his decisions after all (LOL).</p>
<p><strong>25    Anonymous God</strong><br>If Yururu were to attack people, Fay would cut his own stomach as an apology (LOL).</p>
<p><strong>26    Anonymous God</strong><br>That chief paladin is laughing all the time back there.</p>
<p><strong>27    Anonymous God</strong><br>Seriously? My Yururu-chan is… I almost got her though.</p>
<p><strong>28    Anonymous God</strong><br>Give it up. She already belongs to Fay. Just fap to her photo instead.</p>
<p><strong>29    Anonymous God</strong><br>>>28<br>It makes it harder to fap to it, you know!</p>
<p><strong>30    Anonymous God　</strong><br>That’s right (LOL) it’s hard to fap if you are just one step away from getting her.</p>
<p><strong>31    Anonymous God</strong><br>Isn’t Bouran quite good too?</p>
<p><strong>32    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Ah- it’s Arthur for me.</p>

<p><strong>37    Anonymous God　</strong><br>This sounds like a phimosis. No doubt about it.</p>

<p><strong>39    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Drill phimosis (LOL).</p>
<p><strong>40    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Well, Fay-sama is the best. Will he be dying soon?</p>
<p><strong>41    Anonymous God　</strong><br>>>40<br>Scary scary scary.</p>
<p><strong>42    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Why do you want him to die?</p>
<p><strong>43    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Because, I can take his soul once he dies, then make it meld into me so we will be together forever.</p>
<p><strong>44    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Wow, sounds like a psychopath. You must be Freya, right?</p>
<p><strong>45    Anonymous God　</strong><br>This sort of dangerous remark definitely came from Freya.</p>
<p><strong>46    Anonymous God　</strong><br>This Yururu girl is a virgin, right? I wouldn&#8217;t approve of it otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>50    Anonymous God　</strong><br>He thinks her tummy’s hurt. Is he an idiot?</p>
<p><strong>51    Anonymous God　</strong><br>He totally thought of her as the master character. His belief is just too intense.</p>
<p><strong>52    Anonymous God　</strong><br>What kind of dangerous mentality does he have there? Isn’t that rare for a human?</p>
<p><strong>53    Anonymous God　</strong><br>>>52<br>He strongly suggested to himself that he is the protagonist.<br>It makes other suggestions invalid against him.<br>He thinks it’s normal for the protagonist to be wounded<br>It allows him to resist fear over injury.<br>He thinks it’s normal for the protagonist to endure pain.<br>It allows him to resist pain.</p>
<p><strong>54    Anonymous God　</strong><br>That sounds dangerous. What’s with him?</p>
<p><strong>55    Anonymous God　</strong><br>I think his mentality seriously belongs to the top tier in the history of humanity.</p>

<p><strong>58    Anonymous God　</strong><br>She’s so cute.</p>
<p><strong>59    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Yururu’s crotch is already yuruyuru for Fay.

<p><strong>63    Anonymous God　</strong><br>That sounds so disgusting. I can&#8217;t laugh over this.</p>
<p><strong>64    Anonymous God　</strong><br>>>59<br>That is definitely Zeus.</p>
<p><strong>65    Anonymous God　</strong><br>That crazy feeling he gave means that there’s no doubt about it.</p>
<p><strong>66    Anonymous God　</strong><br>I can’t like that Fay fellow. It’s too disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>67    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Ah?</p>
<p><strong>68    Anonymous God　</strong><br>>>66<br>Ah, those must be his last words before he gets killed by Fay’s hardcore fans.</p>
<p><strong>69    Anonymous God　</strong><br>There are such people?</p>
<p><strong>70　Anonymous God</strong><br>There is.</p>
<p><strong>71    Anonymous God　</strong><br>He is quite popular. His soul will return to Athena once he dies, but there are gods who have already begun to bid for his soul for a large amount of money. Like Freya.</p>
<p><strong>72    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>73    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Hey, Fay is not that big of a deal, right?</p>
<p><strong>74    Anonymous God　</strong><br>>>73<br>I’ll kill you. Don’t say such a thing about Fay-sama. Who do you think you are to speak in such haughty tones?</p>
<p><strong>75    Anonymous God    　</strong><br>>>74<br>Well, I’m a god.</p>
<p><strong>76    Anonymous God　</strong><br>LOL.</p>
<p><strong>77    Anonymous God　</strong><br>What about Maria?</p>
<p><strong>78    Anonymous God　</strong><br>The reason why Fay is weakened, huh. Most of the things are Maria’s fault.</p>
<p><strong>79    Anonymous God　</strong><br>That’s right. It’s Maria’s fault.</p>
<p><strong>80    Anonymous God　</strong><br>But Maria also has it bad, you know? I know since I played the game.</p>
<p><strong>81    Anonymous God　</strong><br>>>80<br>What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>82    Anonymous God　</strong><br>>>81<br>Isn’t it all about how her parents got slain by the Abyss monsters?</p>
<p><strong>83    Anonymous God　</strong><br>>>82<br>Nope, I cleared the game so I know, but the Maria Route is seriously beyond saving. She might grow into someone like a heroine to Tlue, but she is quite pitiful by the end. Moreover, there’s a backstory involving her parents’ circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>84    Anonymous God　</strong><br>What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>85    Anonymous God　</strong><br>>>84<br>Maria’s memories were tampered with. I knew it.</p>
<p><strong>86    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Seriously? That sounds dangerous in so many ways. As expected of a utsu novel game.</p>
<p><strong>87    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Well, Fay will do something about it (random).</p>
<p><strong>88    Anonymous God　</strong><br>You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>89    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Fay keeps saying it’s not over yet and he will eventually sort everything out (LOL).</p>
<p><strong>90    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Rather, I did have this thought when I saw Yururu’s scenario, but isn’t this just a bit too heavy for a story?</p>
<p><strong>91    Anonymous God　</strong><br>The writer definitely loves a Bitter END.</p>
<p><strong>92    Anonymous God　</strong><br>I know that. This kind of person hates Happily Ever Afters. More than half of the people who came during the entrance exam would die.

<p><strong>93    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Eh? Then Yururu-chan will die? She didn’t die, right?</p>
<p><strong>94    Anonymous God　</strong><br>If Fay missed her at that moment and she went to the free city, she would die as she meets her terrible ordeal.</p>
<p><strong>95    Anonymous God　</strong><br>As expected of Fay.</p>

<p><strong>97    Anonymous God　</strong><br>Well, Fay will do something about it (random).</p>
<p><strong>98    Anonymous God　</strong><br>I guess so.</p>

<p>These gods are only observing. Since some people thought gods will intervene mid-plot, I came to explain directly. They won’t. Because of heavenly law (random excuse), they can’t intervene with people once they reincarnate them!!!</p>
