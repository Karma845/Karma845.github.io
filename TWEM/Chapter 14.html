<h2>Chapter 14 &#8211; After the Battle</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went straight down to the cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Argh, I can’t wait to go to bed&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was thinking that, Finne, Iris, Suzuno, Ephyr, Asha, and Kusel came running towards me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When did they get here?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are all of you here&#8230; I thought I told you to stay at the inn&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And just watch and twiddle our thumbs? You know we can’t do that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Besides, we knew there was no chance Haruto would lose, so we came here to pick you up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris and Finne answered, and the others nodded in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, it was a close call, but&#8230;I’mma keep that bit out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I won in the end, so it’s all good&#8230;I guess, as long as everyone&#8217;s all right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, Ilmina, who looked as if she was about to burst into tears, called out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert and Gawain were also behind her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;What’s up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um, I don&#8217;t know how to thank you&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, so that’s it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you want to thank someone, thank Iris.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? But&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told you, didn’t I? Iris asked me to help you, so I did. Right, Iris?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said and looked at Iris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris smiled and nodded toward Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because you’re my friend, Ilmina! You&#8217;re supposed to help your friends! Although this time, it wasn’t me, but Haruto.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyway, that&#8217;s how it is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying that, Ilmina hugged Iris and started crying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Ilmina was crying, Liebert and Gawain also expressed their gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you very much, Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please accept my gratitude as well, Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They both bowed deeply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come on, please raise your heads. Can we talk inside instead? &#8230;That’s if there are any rooms left standing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure. That would be great.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert chuckled and looked back at the damaged cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, when Ilmina stopped crying, we headed to a room in the cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as we were seated, Liebert bowed to me once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, allow me to convey our sincerest gratitude for saving our holy city——or rather, the Holy State of Belifaire. We all thank you from the bottom of our hearts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Liebert, Ilmina and Gawain bowed their heads to me as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come on guys. Just like I said earlier, I did it because Iris asked me to help her friend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto is too kind, so it’s just like him to lend a hand!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris said, looking all smug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And why is she puffing out her chest?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Finne, Suzuno and the others were also nodding their heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was starting to feel a little embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so? Then, about the reward&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert said and looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I pulled a fast one on him and opened my mouth before he did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t need a reward. Just the thought alone is enough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I appreciate you saying so. However, you’re the hero who saved our country, Haruto. I would like to at least give you something in return. You can request for anything, so long as it’s within our powers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you say it like that, I thought about it as well during the designated commission. I have more than enough money and I don&#8217;t even need status or honor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also I’m currently on a trip, and plan to return to my original world sooner or later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay&#8230;then, how about making it so I can move in and out of the country freely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that what you want?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. Just being able to pass freely through the checkpoints is enough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert was still not satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Ilmina spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Father, I think it’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ilmina?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Remember, Haruto is an adventurer. I understand that as the ones showing our gratitude, the request seems too humble and far from enough, but since that’s the case, the only thing we can do now is to do our best to meet up with the support he requested to the best of our abilities, isn’t that right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert nodded in response to Ilmina&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;You’re right. It’s just as you said, Ilmina. Haruto, could you give me a moment?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert asked a nearby nun to bring a piece of paper and a pen, and within seconds he wrote something and stamped it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Here. You can have this, Haruto. It will serve as a form of identification. With this, you can freely enter and leave almost anywhere in the country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took it from Liebert and read through the contents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It read, ‘I, Liebert Heilig, guarantee the identity of this adventurer, Haruto’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve confirmed it. Thank you. Does this apply to my friends as well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, it is only for you, Haruto. But not to worry. Captain Gawain, if you’d please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert placed the object he received from Gawain on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a simple knife in the shape of a cross.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s the identification I’ll be giving the others. It doesn’t have as much recognition as the one I handed to you, but it will still allow you to move freely in the country. There’s enough for everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Liebert said this, the nuns who had been standing by, handed Iris and the others the rest of the knives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone who received the knives thanked Liebert one by one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Iris turned to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I may, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who was behind this incident?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at Liebert&#8217;s expression and wondered if it’s okay to tell them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s all right. Although I can&#8217;t let the people find out about it, so I’d ask that it doesn’t leave these four walls——excuse me Sisters, and the Holy Knights, if you would please secure the perimeter around the room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert asked the nuns and holy knights to leave the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure they’re also aware of who the mastermind is, but he must have had them stand guard so that no one will overhear our conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they were ready, Liebert opened his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The people who kidnapped Ilmina were members of the satanic cult, led by Cardinal Alben and his fellow cultists. They summoned the highest-ranking devil, and the result is what we just witnessed&#8230;but, I cannot let the people find out about this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that makes sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cardinal, who was also a leading figure in the Holy State, turned out to be a devil worshiper, and was also the one responsible for this situation. If the truth were to come out, the country would surely lose its credibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, Iris nodded in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A Cardinal&#8230;huh. Then it makes sense that you would want to keep this under wraps.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoa, I was expecting Iris to say something like, you shouldn&#8217;t hide the truth from the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You think so too huh, Iris.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course. If the people were to become uneasy and start a riot, it would only cause unnecessary casualties, right? And that’s the last thing anyone wants.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, as a princess, really cared about the people. No wonder the people of the royal capital like her so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert nodded and turned to Gawain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you think, Knight Captain Gawain?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh. As Princess Iris said, it could lead to a riot. So regarding this incident, I think it would be better to say that Cardinal Alben and the others were possessed by the devil.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s a decent enough explanation, I’d say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert seemed to agree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sounds good. Then, may I trouble you with leaking the information?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it, please leave it to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we were talking about this, for some reason, Ilmina was glancing at me and fidgeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s the matter, Ilmina?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hieek?! Oh, no, it&#8217;s nothing, nothing&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fidgeting restlessly, while glancing back and forth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Goddamn it, I can’t help being curious!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s the matter, Ilmina? You seem strangely restless.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Liebert asked, Ilmina finally opened her mouth while blushing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um, it&#8217;s about the reward&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I already gave Haruto the reward, though?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, that&#8217;s not what I meant&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then make yourself clear.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-Okay. Um, you see, as a reward for saving the holy city, well&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone present was staring at Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I said that I’d give everything I have as reward&#8230;! ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina&#8217;s cheeks turned even redder, and she plopped down on the table, covering her face with both hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, my four fiancees namely Finne, Iris, Suzuno, and Ephyr sent sharp glares at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cold sweat trickled down my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it just me or are their eyes getting colder?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned to Kusel, but she looked uninterested, and Asha was looking dumbfounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero was standing quietly with his eyes closed, as if he wasn&#8217;t interested in the subject at all&#8230;he’s not sleeping, is he?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hurriedly came up with an excuse to tell the four of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um listen guys, I obviously refused, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I managed to say so, but the stares from the four of them turned even colder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Ilmina, who looked up just a little, opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-Haruto, do you not want me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn&#8217;t say anything to her as she looked at me with tears in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris then raised her voice cheerfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am all in favor! And Ilmina is my friend to begin with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris seems to be fine with it, but&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne called out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, what is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From what I can see, Ilmina is a nice and wonderful person. But if you keep bringing in new wives everywhere you go like this, I won&#8217;t be able to spend time with you, Haruto&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne looked sad and downcast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finne&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m not proactively trying to get more fiancees, either&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of which.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finne. I&#8217;ve said it before, you’re the one I hold most dear, Finne. I love everyone else, too, of course. But if you make a sad face like that, then——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then Finne interrupted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m not going to say anything even if you get more. But I want you to love everyone, including me. As long as you keep that in mind, I won&#8217;t object.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That goes without saying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded, and Finne replied with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it&#8217;s okay with you, Finne, it&#8217;s okay with me. But next time, we&#8217;ll have a meeting before adding any more!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s right! We&#8217;ll have ourselves a fiancee conference!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Suzuno agreed with Ephyr&#8230;what&#8217;s a fiancee conference?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I guess this means that all four of them are fine with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks like I dodged the bullet this time&#8230;as I was thinking this, I heard Liebert&#8217;s low voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahem. May I have a word, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, sure, what’s&#8230;up&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">W-Whelp, this ain’t good. I can tell from the tone of his voice, without looking into his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He&#8217;s fuming like crazy!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, you&#8217;re making Ilmina your fiancee, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned my head awkwardly towards him, but the aura emanating from Liebert was tremendous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s invisible, but I sure can feel it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, his bloodshot eyes are spooky as hell. Not the kind one should see on a Pope, that’s for sure!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dammit, what’s the play here?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm? What do you want to do with my beloved daughter? Please tell me, I won&#8217;t be offended.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah right! Your aura already says it all!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s got that dangerous look in his eyes, as if he will hack me in pieces if I say anything funny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to go with the most reliable means in order to give Liebert a most satisfactory reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And by that I mean——Almighty Ellis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellis! The best solution if you would!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;&#8230;There isn’t one.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That can’t, be&#8230;? Even Ellis can&#8217;t come up with an answer?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was inwardly astonished, Liebert pressed on demanding answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What about it, Haruto? The question ain’t going to answer itself if you keep quiet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Way to go with the pressure!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I reached out to Finne, Iris and the others for help, but they quickly looked away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;re on your own. That seemed to be the message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at Ilmina and our eyes met.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, Ilmina&#8217;s cheeks flushed and the pressure from Liebert increased by a notch when he saw this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ugh, you know what, fuck it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will just say what’s on my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s not my decision to make. Then again, I guess it is&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would like to hear your own thoughts on the matter, Ilmina.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said this, all eyes gathered on Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert asked Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you want to do? You’re free to do whatever you want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, Ilmina opened her mouth with a bright red face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Father, um, the, the truth is, I-I-I really like H-Haruto!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying this, she covered her face with her hands again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s so cute to watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ilmina&#8230;I see now. I understand that love is different for each person. In the first place, I have always wanted Ilmina to be able to make her own decisions when it comes to her own love life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, father!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina thanked him with a big smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Liebert continued and looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, what are your thoughts on this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m honestly flattered you feel that way about me, Ilmina. So, allow me to respond with the same degree of determination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got up from my chair, kneeled down in front of her, looked straight at her and opened my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it’s all right with you, I&#8217;d like you, Ilmina, to support me along with Finne and everyone else.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said and held out my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-Yes, of course. I-I hope you will treat me kindly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina smiled with flushed cheeks and took my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the best smile I&#8217;ve ever seen, like a blooming sunflower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s great, Ilmina!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris and the others came up to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iris&#8230;yes, it is! And, nice to meet you all!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina greeted my fiancees, Finne, Iris, Suzuno, and Ephyr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once again, I&#8217;m Finne. Welcome aboard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m Suzuno. Let’s get along from now on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am Ephyr. I look forward to spending time together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you everyone!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After greeting Ilmina, the three shook hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Again, it’s nice to have you among us, Ilmina!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too, I&#8217;m looking forward to spending time together, Iris! ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At any rate, they seem to be getting along just fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was watching the four of them, Liebert called out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please take good care of Ilmina. I&#8217;m not asking this of you as the Pope, but as her father.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His eyes showed he was dead serious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t just give him a random answer, so I looked him in the eye and replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please leave it to me. I will be sure to protect Ilmina no matter what. She is now my fiancee, so rest assured.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The respectful tone was also a gesture of sincerity on my part as the one taking away Liebert’s daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Thank you. But I gotta say, I just can&#8217;t get used to you using honorifics, please carry on with the way you were. So, will you be taking Ilmina along on your trip too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, Ilmina is a saint. I can&#8217;t just show up and decide to take her along so easily. And before anything, wouldn’t it be best to hear from the person in question?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Ilmina looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I want to go with Haruto too. But with the capital in turmoil due to the situation. I will have to stay back this time and fulfill my role as a saint.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see that Ilmina wants to help out her country as a saint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like to respect her wishes and won’t force her to come along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay. Is that okay with you, Liebert?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded and asked, and Liebert nodded as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right. Honestly, that would be very helpful. So, Haruto, when do you plan to leave the holy city?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re planning to attend the Empire’s tournament, and would rather we arrive somewhat early, so&#8230;I&#8217;m going to remain here for a few more days. Until then, I&#8217;m going to take it easy, you know, with all that has transpired.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m so beat&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really can’t wait to go back and lie down&#8230;it&#8217;s starting to get to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina seemed a little down, I wonder if our departure was earlier than she had expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ll come back here after the tournament.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m going to hold you to it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina leaned in and took both my hands in hers, staring at me intently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tender, flowery scent hits my nostrils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, I promise you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Liebert chipped in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, we have prepared rooms for you all tonight. You can have a good rest here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, that’s perfect. I&#8217;m not going to lie, I was already thinking about how I’m going to get myself back to the inn. In return, I&#8217;m going to help with the city&#8217;s recovery efforts tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cathedral is also quite damaged, and the area around the building where the devil summoning took place, as well as the city, must have suffered some damage from the battle between Zero and Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you sure? I mean you’ve already done enough&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, because If I go to the Empire like this, it’ll just linger on my mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, even though I said I’m going to take it easy, with my ability, it shouldn’t be a problem if it’s just reconstruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said that with that thought in mind, Liebert smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. I would very much appreciate it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, can we talk about the details tomorrow? For now, I would like for you to please show me to my room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert called the nuns who were outside the room and asked them to show us to our rooms.</span></p>
