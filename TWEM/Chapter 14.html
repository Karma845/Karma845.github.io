<h3>Chapter 14 &#8211; Mission Start</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After dinner the next day, I gathered everyone together and told them that I was going to execute the operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since last night, my Detect Presence and Detect Magic had been going off like crazy, it was then I knew that someone was watching me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the response was very weak, probably because my Covert skill is over the roof. If Noir’s team hadn’t carried out their investigation, I would have overlooked it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, tonight, I am going to carry out the operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan is quite simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will act as a decoy and go into a back alley unarmed. Then, I and the other members of the crew who would be in hiding will ambush the assailants and get them to cough out the identity of the client and mastermind behind it&#8230;simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they happen to be related to the merchant association or Cobra, then I will just go ahead and annihilate them completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;I was beginning to feel like it was too simple to be called an operation, but oh well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This operation will be carried out by just the three of us, me, Zero, and Sebas. If the perps turn out to be at the level of a Cobra executive, you guys may not necessarily be able to handle them. And I also don&#8217;t want to see any of you get hurt, so I hope you understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero and Sebas, dressed in butler uniforms of the same design, bowed gracefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero seemed to have become a butler completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne and the others nodded their heads in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Zero, Sebas. I want you two to stay away from me and keep a lookout. If you catch any assassins, leave one for interrogation and dispose of the rest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood. Master Haruto.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m counting on you guys&#8230;and what about the store by the way?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Noir is currently monitoring the store. With her ability, I think she’s got it covered as long as it&#8217;s nothing too serious. And if anything goes wrong, she will come back to let us know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. It’s all good then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr, who had apparently become friends with Noir, was somewhat proud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, we should get going. I’m leaving the fort to you guys.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were about to leave when Finne called out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s up, Finne?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be fine, but please be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course, don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll be back safe and sound&#8230;Zero, Sebas, shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““Roger!””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I left the mansion with Zero and Sebas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, I decided to head to the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they’re a little far away, the guys surveilling me seemed to be tagging along. Moreover&#8230;there seemed to be more of them, I thought?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s looking even more likely that they may try something today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I arrived at the store, Bohbee noticed me.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-20491963' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-20491963' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The store had closed for business for the day, but he seemed to be organizing the merchandise and filling out the books.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Boss!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How are the sales looking?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee grinned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The business was booming again today, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. Oh, by the way, I&#8217;ve got a new product, and I&#8217;d like to give you the blueprints and instructions&#8230;is the back room free?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, of course!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as we entered the room and took our seats, I handed him a piece of paper describing the new product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee quickly skimmed through the contents and exclaimed in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“C-Could this be&#8230;a small magic refrigerator?! I didn&#8217;t know it was possible to make it this small!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right, there are refrigerators in this world, as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, they are quite expensive due to the large amount of magic stones required. In addition, because of the size of the refrigerators themselves, they are only found in royal castles, noble residences, and some restaurants and stores, and are not widely used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the refrigerator this time is about the size of a slightly larger family refrigerator in the original world, and a compact size just enough for a single person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, because the circuitry had been made more efficient, it could be produced with smaller magic stones, resulting in a significant cost reduction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let&#8217;s try making a prototype of these, and show it to me when it&#8217;s finished. If it turns out well, we&#8217;ll mass-produce them and then start selling ‘em.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand. But what about the pricing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m thinking we could put the small one up for eight large silver coins, and the large one for about five gold coins.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I think that&#8217;s about right because the large-sized one requires a reasonably large magic stone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Exactly. Okay then, I&#8217;m going to be off now. There is this daredevil crying for a beating that I have to oblige, you see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Oh, I see. It’s today. Take care then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee must have guessed from my words that the operation was today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was about to leave the room when I suddenly remembered and instructed Zero and Sebas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You two, I want you to blend in with the staff while concealing your presence and go out the back door. Then, stay out of sight. Bohbee, please see me out, but not too deliberately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““Yes, sir.””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, this way sir.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee escorted me out of the store building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Now then, let the mission begin.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I muttered softly and started walking back to the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way, I pretended to make a detour and proceeded toward a less populated area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, after acting like I had chanced upon a suitable back alley, I proceeded there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇ ◇ ◇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of a building about 200 meters away from Haruto.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-83789822' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-83789822' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The target is on the move. We will now begin the operation&#8230;the butlers who were accompanying him earlier have separated from him, and now he’s completely alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man dressed in a black outfit with gadgets signaled his companions around him to advance under the shade of the night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I happened to witness the scene during the previous crisis where he saved the royal capital, and I couldn’t help but be in awe at the sight of the sheer power of that magic, truly befitting of an EX-rank. But, if he were to receive a concentrated attack outside his sphere of awareness with this number of people, even him wouldn’t stand a chance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The others nearby nodded, affirming those words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He doesn&#8217;t seem to know these parts well. It&#8217;s a dead-end just ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, that&#8217;s where we’ll hit him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assassins shared the information among themselves in the vicinity and began to move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But they were none the wiser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That their target, Haruto, knew their location and deliberately chose a dead-end road to lure them out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That the two butlers, who did not come out of the store together the same way they went in, were lurking a short distance away, watching them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh? Oh no, you gotta be kiddin’ me, a dead end?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing the target&#8217;s voice, the man gave a signal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, poisoned arrows and knives were flying toward the target, and a figure with a sword appeared and charged toward the target.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I launched fireballs to intercept the attacks of the assassins who got hooked completely in my trap. And burned away the arrows and knives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then took control of these very fireballs and redirected them towards the bunch on the roof who initiated the attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of them died on the spot, but there was only one who avoided the fireball and landed on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was distracted, some of them came at me with swords, but I approached them with Ground Shrink and knocked them out with my barehanded arts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guy who had landed on the ground shouted in agitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the—, was he already aware of our attack?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course I was aware. I am sure you lot thought you hid pretty well, but to me, your presence and bloodlusts may as well have been a beacon&#8230;you fucked with the wrong guy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh shit&#8230;shit! Pull out!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the sound of that voice, several people, who were probably standing by as insurance personnel, tried to escape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Zero, Sebas, take care of all of them but this guy.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-96514749' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-96514749' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““Roger!””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my command, Zero and Sebas appeared and stood in front of those who were trying to escape, neutralizing them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were mercilessly taking lives, probably because they found out that the ones who somehow happened around my feet were still alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, on the other hand, grabbed the guy who seemed like the leader who was the same guy who gave the order to retreat, and I struck him cold with my fist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In no time at all, the assassins who were after me were all killed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Brilliant. Zero, Sebas.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am honored by your praise. If my Lord commands it, I will even make enemies of the entire world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ho-ho-ho. I am not about to lose to you young’uns anytime soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strongest and most loyal butler and the strongest old butler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;That said, Zero, you don&#8217;t have to go that far, okay? If you do that, I&#8217;ll really become the Demon King, won&#8217;t I?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now then. There’s something I will very much like to know before I call the guards.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s see, there were five survivors out of twenty-five.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, I decided to wake up the guy who looked like their leader.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, wake up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Hmm? S-Sunnuva bitch!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leader woke up and tried to get up as soon as he did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I immediately kicked him and broke his leg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AAAAAARGH!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How noisy, shut the fuck up—heal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly healed him as planned, and squatted down to face level with the leader, staring him right in the eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As you must have figured out by now, you can&#8217;t avoid my attacks with your level of speed. And just so you know, aside from healing, I can also use a magic spell to restore physical defects&#8230;you should be able to understand the implication of what I’m saying, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked this, but the leader glared at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then tried to stand up again, so I gently put my hand on his shoulder this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said this with a smile on my face, the leader broke into a heap, sweat pouring from his entire body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Great, thanks for your understanding. So, I have a few questions I’d like to ask you&#8230;I’m sure you don’t mind?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leader nodded in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the way, I can tell when someone is lying or not, so keep that in mind before you open your mouth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This dude just said okay, but I bet he’s going to try and play a fast one for sure&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This should be fun, in that case, why not show me how conniving the most notorious assassination group in the country can be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, let’s begin with. Who are you working for?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Viscount Birksh—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re lying.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How do you know the big boss&#8217;s name?! Don&#8217;t tell me you already know that Count Balazel is the big boss of Cobra?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm? All I wanted to know was the name of his employer, so I tossed a random bait to get him to cough up, but&#8230;to think this dude would run his mouth on his own about Balazel, being the boss of Cobra, and about himself being a member as well?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funny enough, he doesn&#8217;t seem to be aware of his blunder, he must have felt pretty on edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Who is the client this time?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fuck it, looks like there&#8217;s no use playing dumb&#8230;it’s Harbal Galba, head of the Harbal Trading Company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems to be true. He suddenly became honest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re being honest with me. Next question. How many are you in Cobra as well as the location of your hideout? I’m sure you already know this, but I will know if you’re lying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh, so you also knew that we were Cobra huh&#8230;If I talk, will you let me go?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dude, you just revealed that yourself just now&#8230;more importantly, does he really think I’m going to let him go?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was dumbfounded and kept silent, he took it as an affirmation and started blabbering on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cobra has a total of one hundred members. This time, twenty-five of us were tasked to assassinate you. The boss is a very cautious man, and did not even tell his colleagues from the other great merchant associations that he was the boss. This time, he made Harbal put up the request. And the location of our hideout is—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a round of talks, the leader exhaled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve told you everything! Now you let me go—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knocked him out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I never said I&#8217;d let him go&#8230;besides, the guards that Zero had gone to call when I started listening to him should be arriving any moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, the guards arrived soon after and were bewildered at the devastation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s going on? What’re all these?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These guys are Cobra, a notorious assassination group. They came after me, so I fought them off. Tie them up and throw them in jail.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said this and was about to leave when I was stopped by the guards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the hell, that should suffice, shouldn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who the hell are you? If what you just said is true, why were they after you? Show us your ID!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Crap, I forgot to mention my name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ID was it? Is this fine?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took out my adventurer&#8217;s card and showed it to the guards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—A jet-black adventurer&#8217;s card&#8230;no way!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guard’s face turned into a look of surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn’t realize it was you, great hero Master Haruto. Please excuse our discourtesy. We will now take these men into custody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, I’ll leave them to you. I&#8217;m going to report to Dillan—His Majesty the King now, but I want you to make sure that you report this matter to him as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood. You two, bring the wagons and any extra hands you can find! The rest of you will tie them up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““““Roger!””””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, we left the scene to the flailing guards and headed for the royal castle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I arrived at the castle and was taken straight to Dillan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He must have sensed that it was an emergency because I have never visited him at night like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was shown to the guest room where Dillan and Rubel were waiting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, it&#8217;s unusual for you to be here at this hour. What&#8217;s the matter?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told them about how I had just been attacked by Cobra and that the mastermind behind the attack was Count Balazel and a coalition of seven merchant associations, including his own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Um Haruto, the members of Cobra are known to be tight-lipped. How in the world did you manage that&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s probably better if you don’t know, to be honest?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I agree, Your Majesty. At any rate, you can be pretty certain that Master Haruto’s information is solid.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebastian said, backing me up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I see. I trust both Haruto and Sebas. And for the both of you to affirm so strongly, then it must be so. Still, to think that Almuth is the big boss of Cobra&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And this coalition of merchant associations. It is quite common for merchant associations to join hands with each other, but then getting this cozy with a criminal organization is&#8230;”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-73212530' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-73212530' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSc0JyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8aW5zIGNsYXNzPSJhZHNieWdvb2dsZSIKICAgICBzdHlsZT0iZGlzcGxheTpibG9jazsgdGV4dC1hbGlnbjpjZW50ZXI7IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtbGF5b3V0PSJpbi1hcnRpY2xlIgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtZm9ybWF0PSJmbHVpZCIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWNsaWVudD0iY2EtcHViLTY2MDk0NDIzMzgwODAxMTYiCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1zbG90PSI1NTg2ODE4NjUwIj48L2lucz4KPHNjcmlwdD4KICAgICAoYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgPSB3aW5kb3cuYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgfHwgW10pLnB1c2goe30pOwo8L3NjcmlwdD4=' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan and Rubel were making seriously worried faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand your surprise, but right now speed is of the essence. I’m sure that Count Balazel hasn’t received word of me defeating Cobra yet. I suggest that you send in the troops to take him into custody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At these words, Dillan glanced at Zebas, and he immediately left the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s probably on his way to rally the knights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, I got up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well then, I guess we should be on our way to annihilate the rest of the Cobra members.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um, I understand that you now know the location of their hideout, but the way you’re treating this like someone taking a stroll to the restroom or something&#8230;can you really afford to be this nonchalant?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh come on now, I wouldn’t worry about it. But, you’re right, it would be great if you could prepare some wagons and soldiers to collect them afterwards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan looked at me with a puzzled look on his face for a moment, but soon realized what I was talking about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;How many hours from now would it be okay to dispatch them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s see, I’ll be returning to the mansion for a bit, and then head to their hideout right away, so maybe in two hours? I heard their executives are quite strong, so it might take some time to wrap up the whole thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“Two hours huh&#8230;uh, okay, that will be all. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing the outcome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded to Dillan, who said in disgust, and left the royal castle to return to the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I came back briefly to explain the situation to Finne and the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing my explanation, Finne and the others were like, “&#8230;Oh poor little assassin, he actually hung on quite a bit.” and so on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyway, I&#8217;ll be going in with Sebas and Zero, just the three of us now that we know where they&#8217;re hiding out. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be fine, but please remain vigilant&#8230;all right, shall we set off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufuu. I’m getting excited.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were leaving the mansion, saying things like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From behind me, I heard Finne say, “You seem to be having fun”.</span></p>
