<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; To the Nargadia Labyrinth</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day, I—Haruto Yuki, a high school student, was suddenly summoned to another world together with my whole class as a hero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, after checking my status, it was discovered that I didn&#8217;t have the title of ‘Hero’ and also did not receive the ‘Gift’ that was supposed to be bestowed to heroes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was driven out by Mariana, the princess of the Kingdom of Glicente who led the summoning and was almost killed by a knight, but a god appeared in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as an apology for forgetting to bestow me a gift, I got some cheat skills such as All Creation, which allows me to create any skill, and God Eye, which allows me to see through anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I swore vengeance on the Kingdom of Glicente and became an adventurer in the Kingdom of Perdis, where I was awarded the world&#8217;s highest rank of adventurer, EX, for my many exploits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, together with fellow adventurer Finne, the first princess of the Kingdom of Perdis Iris, her attendant Asha, the former elf princess Ephyr, and other friends, I succeeded in exacting my revenge on Glicente.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;After successfully rebuilding the internal affairs of Glicente, my former classmates, Tendo, Suzuno, and the others decided to train themselves so that they could defeat the Demon King.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-90727397' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-90727397' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After sending the group of heroes to the ‘Nargadia Labyrinth’, a dungeon in the kingdom of Glicente, we also set out a week later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ones heading to the Nargadia Labyrinth this time are me, Finne, Iris, Asha, and Ephyr. Including Kusel, a former knight who had joined us during the attack on Glicente, bringing the total number to six.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope Tendo and the others are okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They should be&#8230;but still can’t help feeling uneasy though.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On our way there, Finne asked me with a worried look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nargadia Labyrinth is just barely difficult enough for Tendo and his friends to clear the middle floor with their current abilities. With their growth rate, they should have progressed a little further by now, but&#8230;for some reason I couldn’t shake this bad feeling I was having.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Feeling worried? But you sent them there, didn&#8217;t you, Haruto?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris said, tilting her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn’t have said it any better.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, yeah. When I confirmed the existence of the dungeon, I also looked at the level of the monsters and determined that they’re not too much for a hero to handle&#8230;just that, there was no information on the boss monster. I heard that there is an evil dragon sealed within, does anyone know anything about it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard the story about the evil dragon from Glifas, the Knight Commander, and Marvelle, the chief royal magician, when we left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel raised her hand in response to my question. As expected of a former knight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I do. Though it’s only something I read somewhere.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please tell me about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right. The Nargadia Labyrinth is said to have a total of thirty floors, but the highest floor ever recorded is twenty. It is said that the most powerful dragon exists at the lowest floor. The book itself is one of those ancient documents that’s been around for centuries, so I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s true or not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The most powerful dragon, huh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds like a fairy tale, but considering the fact that I couldn&#8217;t confirm the information back there using God Eye, then it might not be utter bullsh*t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I once again decided to check out the boss at the bottom of the Nargadia Labyrinth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The map function that comes with God Eye also has the ability to look up information on a target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information on the boss monster didn’t seem like it was restricted or anything of the sort, but&#8230;now that I have a clue about the dragon, I might be able to find out something if I really try.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, guys, I&#8217;m going to concentrate for a bit and see what I can find out, take care of the carriage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said and closed my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After about an hour of gathering information—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, holy sh*t&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn&#8217;t help but let out a few words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha asked me.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-29631493' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-29631493' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Tendo and his party are no match for the dragon at the bottom of the Nargadia Labyrinth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—! So the rumor about there being a dragon is true!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr’s eyes widened, and Finne, who was sitting in the coach’s seat. turned to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded and hesitantly spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah. And&#8230;the boss monster&#8217;s level is—300.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone who heard the level exclaimed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone knew that my current level was 355.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even the heroes and Kusel, who was the vice commander of the knights, are at about one-fifth my level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five people with the highest levels are Suzuno Ichinomiya, Koji Tendo, Shinya Mogami, Aoi Shinonome, and Natsuki Asakura. However, even so, they haven&#8217;t even reached level 100, so they’re not even close to be a match for a level 300.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Finne asked me with a serious look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto. Are we going to make it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess she meant, if we can catch up with Tendo and the others before they face the boss monster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;We’d be cutting it really close. At their level, it might take a few more days to get to the boss monster at the bottom floor, and&#8230;even if they end up confronting it, they&#8217;re not going to get killed right away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-That’s true.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believed in them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are heroes, after all, and they have the self-crafted special item I gave to them that can protect one from an instant death magic attack only once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t mean we can drag our feet, however.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if we arrived at the dungeon, it would take some time to reach the bottom floor.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And even though the monsters in the dungeon are small fry for me, and I can see the shortest route on the map, I can&#8217;t run as fast as I can with Finne and the rest in tow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would take about a day to reach the lowest floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let&#8217;s hurry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I returned to the coach stand and drove my beloved horse, Maguro, who was pulling the carriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a day and a half of running, using recovery magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had arrived at the entrance to the Nargadia Labyrinth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must have been a tough one for Maguro, but he&#8217;s been a really reliable partner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Maguro to move to another space I had created, a subspace. There was no way I could take him around the dungeon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The carriage was also put into the subspace, and after a brief preparation, we stepped into the labyrinth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now then, shall we go in?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With my friends who were full of enthusiasm, we proceeded smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the current level of the heroes, they can make it to the middle floor&#8230;meaning, they’re no better than flies to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Finne and the others were a little higher in level than the heroes, they were able to advance to the lower floors without difficulty, but from there on, they began to struggle somewhat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like a good place to train but&#8230;we’re in a hurry right now, so maybe I’ll come back another time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was looking at the map and taking the shortest route, we encountered a party of some classmates just past the 20th floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, they&#8217;ve grown enough to reach this point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we crossed the 25th floor, we no longer encountered our classmates, but up to this point, we still haven&#8217;t been able to see Tendo, Suzuno, Mogami, Shinonome, or Asakura.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-19632144' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-19632144' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Checking again on the map, it seemed that they were already near the exit of the 29th floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;This is bad. They&#8217;re about to reach the thirtieth floor.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Seriously?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. For some reason, I can&#8217;t find out what&#8217;s going on inside, even with my powers&#8230;let&#8217;s hurry up a bit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded at Finne, who seemed surprised, and increased my speed until everyone could keep up with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, a short time after Tendo and the others entered the 30th floor, we reached the 29th floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we reached the midpoint of the journey to the 30th floor entrance, we felt a tremendous amount of magic power swelling from below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s with this, magic power?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris shouted in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s Tendo&#8217;s magic power. But he didn&#8217;t have this much magic power or the skills to amplify it&#8230;perhaps he’s acquired a new skill?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I muttered to myself, but immediately afterwards, a magic power much larger than that of Tendo swelled up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh, wh, what, what tremendous magic power&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&#8220;Unbelievable&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha and Kusel were surprised by the magic power that probably seemed to be that of the evil dragon, and stopped in their tracks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—I&#8217;ll go on ahead! You guys keep up at your pace!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I left it at that, used my intimidation skills to neutralize all the enemies on the 29th floor, and headed for the stairs leading to the bottom floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I ran down the stairs and kicked in the door, I saw a huge dragon about to release the magic power it had stored in its mouth at Tendo and his party.</span></p>
