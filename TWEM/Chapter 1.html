<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 1 – An Awakening Event is considered Common Sense</span></h2>
<p>I was a boy who longed to be a protagonist. From a young age, I learnt about courage, dreams, passion, importance of effort, and various other things from the protagonists of fictions. They were all cool people, so I wanted to become like that too.</p>
<p>I began to act at an early age. But my actions were too chuuni, so people around me were all repulsed. When we were on school trips, the girls often played games with the punishment being to sit beside me if they lost… Well, many things have happened since then, and I thought it couldn’t be helped, so I gave up on it… However, deep inside my heart, I was still drawn into it.　</p>
<p>Whether it be Harem or Fantasy, I wanted to be reincarnated in such a world.　</p>
<p>I was always thinking about such a thing.　</p>
<p>Then it happened. While I was on my way to attend my first year of high school, there was an elementary school kid who began crossing the road while ignoring the red light. I proceeded to jump in to protect the kid and died in the crash. I couldn’t remember why I did that. Perhaps it was out of my chuuni heart, that wanted to do something protagonist-like.</p>
<p>I felt my life end with the dull sound of the car hitting me. However, that wasn’t actually the end of it. A god told me I would be reincarnated.　</p>
<p>“Okay, I will reincarnate you as the protagonist of a novel game titled ‘Round Table Heroes’. <em>(Actually, I will reincarnate you as the cannon fodder named Fay though</em>.)”</p>
<p>“Re-really?!”</p>
<p>I had heard about the novel game called Round Table Heroes. My friend recommended it to me, but I never managed to play it. I knew the character that’s 1<sup>st</sup> in popularity though. Even so, I don’t care as long as I get reincarnated as the protagonist! After all, most problems can be resolved eventually!　</p>
<p>“Indeed, my heart as a god was moved by how you protected that child.”　</p>
<p>“I did iiiiiit!! My next life is a winner!”</p>
<p>“Please enjoy the protagonist Role Play of your dreams. By the way, you will be reincarnated as a boy named Fay, your previous life’s memories will return when you reach 13 years old.”</p>
<p>“I-I see. If I’m not wrong, Fay is the most popular character, right? I’ve never played the game, but I’m aware of that character’s name.”</p>
<p>“Ah- that’s right.”</p>
<p>“Since he was the most popular character, that means-”</p>
<p>“Indeed, the character named Fay is the protagonist. He’s not the most popular character for nothing, after all!”</p>
<p>“Ooohhh!”</p>
<p>It seemed that my next life would be a success story. What a wonderful goddess I’ve gotten to meet! I was overwhelmed by the good fortune I got. And… my thoughts were dazzled at that moment…　</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
<p>I am the Goddess, Athena. My duty was to observe the dead, guide them to the afterlife and grant them a new life, then watch over their actions in their next life to kill my boredom. And so, the next soul I have to guide… Fu-hn, so it’s a teenage high school boy who loved the idea of protagonists who appeared in fictions… then he got hit by a car and died. Fu-hn.</p>
<p>Well, I guess he could be considered a good person since he died to protect a random child.　</p>
<p>And then, the boy appeared in front of me. At that time, a certain thought came to my mind.　</p>
<p>[“Let’s deceive this guy into thinking he is reincarnated as a protagonist while I actually reincarnate him as cannon fodder (LOL)”]　</p>
<p>I was curious about how this guy would spend his life then. Me having this kind of thought couldn&#8217;t be helped. After all, gods were hungry for entertainment.　</p>
<p>“Okay then, I will reincarnate you as the protagonist of a novel game titled Round Table Heroes.”　</p>
<p>“Re-really?!”</p>
<p>Actually, I will reincarnate you as the cannon fodder named Fay. (LOL)</p>
<p>“Indeed, my heart as a god was moved by how you protected that child.”　</p>
<p>Well, although that’s not exactly a lie… my heart wasn’t actually moved that much (LOL). 　</p>
<p>“I did iiiiiit!! My next life is a winner!”</p>
<p>“Please enjoy the protagonist Role Play of your dreams. By the way, you will be reincarnated as a boy named Fay, your previous life’s memories will return when you reach 13 years old.”</p>
<p>“I-I see. If I’m not wrong, Fay is the most popular character, right? I’ve never played the game, but I’m aware of that character’s name.”</p>
<p>“Ah- that’s right.”</p>
<p>He sure only knew about weird stuff. Well, that ranking was made as a result of a collusion of people in a thread trying to make fans of the story cry though. (LOL)　</p>
<p>He sure was an interesting fellow (LOL) it seems I was right to deceive him!!　</p>
<p>“Since he was the most popular character, that means-”</p>
<p>“Indeed, the character named Fay is the protagonist. He’s not the most popular character for nothing, after all!”</p>
<p>“Ooohhh!”</p>
<p>I let a laugh escape me. I was sure this child would show me a wondeful dance in his next life.　</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
<p>I was struck with a high fever. Indeed, just as the god told me, this was proof that I’ve possessed the character named Fay as he hit 13 years old. The boy had black hair, black eyes, the face was well… should I say it looked a little villainous despite being the protagonist? Or that he’s got a taunting gaze? Well, there were those types of protagonists anyway.　</p>
<p>I was reincarnated as the protagonist of a novel game. It made my heart throb in excitement just simply knowing that. But to understand my current situation, I spent a few days normally. Then I learned about many things.　</p>
<p>First of all, the words I spoke, for some reason, weirdly converted into something provocative. When I said “Hey” it became “Oi”, or when I said “Good morning” it converted into “What are you doing?”, it felt like my words were being translated in that fashion. Why did it end up like this?　</p>
<p>Perhaps the character named Fay was supposed to be the Cool type of protagonist? Perhaps this kind of word translation was something like a protagonist’s correction. In that case, there was no problem. A cool guy usually spoke haughtily after all.　</p>
<p>And the place I live in seemed to be an orphanage. In other words, I was an orphan, and there were tons of children other than me. Well, having a protagonist as an orphan was often used in fiction too after all. There was also a sister called Maria, a blonde busty beauty who looked dangerously cute. She truly was cute. She seemed to be twenty five years old though. But she was still cute.</p>
<p>Well then, since the world I live in was based on a game, that meant there would come a point where the plot would begin. I didn&#8217;t know when that moment would come. But I already expected it would come eventually, so it was better to prepare to be able to fight moving forward.　</p>
<p>This world seemed to be set in a medieval kind of world with swords and magic. There were people known as paladins in this world, and their top priority was to protect the people of the Britannia Kingdom, of which the orphanage was part of, from the monsters called Abyss.　</p>
<p>And it seemed that people could take an entrance assessment into the knights brigade once they were fifteen years old. That was how I got my revelation! I, who had read many fictions, understood that I would enter the knights brigade once I hit fifteen years old!! Then I would show off my moves which would fascinate people, then eventually lead into a wonderful life surrounded by heroines!　</p>
<p>I was able to form a rough plan in my head. In that case, there was only one thing I should do. I was currently 13 years old, in other words, I have two years to up my skill with swords! Since there were wooden swords and secret manuals in this orphanage, I would make use of this and improve my expertise in swordsmanship from now on!　</p>
<p>With that in mind, I started to practice swordsmanship. It seemed Fay was already originally detached from others in the orphanage, so nobody came to talk to me. I could invest all my effort and time for my future to my heart&#8217;s content.　</p>
<p>“Fay, you shouldn’t overdo yourself.”　</p>
<p>“Aah, of course.”</p>
<p>My words turned into goading ones. This couldn’t be helped since most cool protagonists were basically haughty. Although I felt sorry for Maria who was simply worried for me, I couldn’t stop this part of me. After all, I was the protagonist, who would save the world if I was defeated? There was such a responsibility imposed on the protagonist after all.　</p>
<p>However, I would swing my swords and grow stronger. I swore to do so.　</p>
<p>After all, I was the protagonist!　</p>
<p>With that in mind, I practiced every day since my consciousness reincarnated into Fay’s body. Maria was staring at my figure. Perhaps Maria was… my heroine? Although I had my doubts —let’s leave the &#8220;Maria is the heroine&#8221; theory for later since I would find out eventually anyway. Rather than that…　</p><div class="watas-75d86d5c7564705f7e9a0e6e8d4eb425 watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-75d86d5c7564705f7e9a0e6e8d4eb425"></div>
<p>“Hey! What are you planning?!”　</p>
<p>“You want something from me?”</p>
<p>The person who interrupted my practice was Tlue, a handsome blond-haired, blue-eyed boy who happened to be the same age as me and also lived in the orphanage. He interrupted my practice every day and I didn’t understand why he would always do so without fail. According to my speculations, he must be the cannon fodder character. There was no doubt about it.　</p>
<p>“Don’t mess with me! There’s no way you will train seriously like this! Did you forget about what you’ve done all this time?!”　</p>
<p>My apologies, but I have no memories of before I possessed Fay’s body. I could only reply, “I see” to Tlue’s claim regardless of how many times he asked me. Also, I have something I cared more about: the things I ought to do as a protagonist. As I dealt with him coldly and ignored his words, Tlue pointed his wooden sword at me.　</p>
<p>“I challenge you to a duel. If I win, I’ll have you explain to me everything!”　</p>
<p>Even if you say that… It&#8217;s fine. Before the world would learn of me, I would teach you how amazing I was. He seemed to have trained in his own way before I began my training, but that wouldn’t be enough to match the innate talent of a protagonist.　</p>
<p>“I don’t mind. I’ll teach you how big the world can be.”　</p>
<p>“What did you say?!”</p>
<p>Tlue and I stood at a distance from each other. Then a single leaf danced in front of me. Both of us understood without needing words. The moment that leaf touc-</p>
<p>“Doraaa!”　</p>
<p>“—Gahaa!”</p>
<p>Tlue attacked me before the leaf fell to the ground, and it was a critical hit. I endured the slash that hit my abdomen. It was very painful… Moreover, he was way faster than I was…　</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 001 – An Awakening Event is considered Common Sense [B]</span></strong></p>
<p>He was faster than me, the protagonist… How could that have happened? I was the protagonist, right?　</p>
<p>Alright, calm down. That one just now was a fluke. That was definitely it… In that case!! I stood up and faced Tlue. Although I was supposed to have attacked him with a speed that cuts the wind… he easily evaded it and, once again, his slash hit my abdomen.　</p>
<p>It happened again, and again. Regardless of how many times I tried, I wasn&#8217;t a match for him. Why was that?　</p>
<p>As I fell to the ground, Tlue’s victory appealed to the people around him…and the orphans praised his deed.　</p>
<p>I was supposed to be the protagonist… However, I couldn’t win against him no matter what I did… Hm? I couldn’t win no matter what… Indeed, it seemed I had no way to achieve victory.　</p>
<p>At that moment, thunder boomed in my head. Ah, was this the awakening event? It was something that commonly happened. It was the trope where during the early stages of the story, a powerless protagonist awakens special powers during a crisis; that kind of event!　</p>
<p>I see. So that’s how it was. No wonder I couldn’t win. For this situation, I had to endure and never give up until my awakening concluded. It was a blind spot I didn’t take into account. So the process of the plot began before the main plot, which happens two years later when I become active as a paladin.　</p>
<p>In that case…　</p>
<p>“Not… yet… the match isn’t over… it’s not over yet!”　</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>What happened after could hardly be considered a battle. I couldn’t win against Tlue’s combat ability no matter how much I tried. However, I believed in the awakening that awaited me, and kept standing every time I fell.　</p>
<p><em>Are we there yet (excited) are we there yet (excited) okay, come on, come on</em>, I kept wishing for it fervently.　</p>
<p>But perhaps our duel was getting too intense.　</p>
<p>“That’s it! What are you doing?!”　</p>
<p>Maria stopped the unscathed Tlue and me, who was wounded all over. My battered body failed to sustain itself, and I fell into deep unconsciousness without achieving my awakening.　</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
<p>For the boy named Tlue, Fay was an unlikable boy. Despite how everyone else cared for and respected others in the orphanage, he alone was self-centered and made derogatory remarks toward others.　</p>
<p>Therefore, not only Tlue, everyone in the orphanage didn’t like Fay, and Sister Maria also found him hard to deal with. No, perhaps Fay already went beyond her control. Every time something happened, Tlue had to stop Fay’s barbaric acts and built a tremendous amount of trust within the orphanage.　</p>
<p>Indeed, Fay was beyond one’s control.　</p>
<p>Until that one day, Fay was struck with a high fever when he was 13…　</p>
<p>Fay, who always did as he liked without care for others, suddenly began to practice swordsmanship every day on his own for some reason. As for Tlue, his parents were attacked and slain by monsters. Therefore, he had trained himself since young to become a paladin to prevent others from experiencing the same pain and protected all he could.　</p>
<p>His talent was also tremendous, comparable to a diamond in the rough.　</p>
<p>Indeed, Tlue felt that he was a special person and didn’t doubt himself. That was why he asked Fay for a duel to teach Fay of his own wrong doings.　</p>
<p>The difference between Tlue, who already trained from an early age, and Fay, who only began training recently, didn’t need to be said. The result was already clear. Neither Tlue nor the orphans at the orphanage doubted Tlue’s victory.</p>
<p>“I challenge you to a duel. If I win, I’ll have you explain to me everything!”　</p>
<p>The duel began. Indeed, what happened was exactly as expected. The point difference of 1 and 10 was obvious without needing to be mentioned.　</p>
<p>Tlue lightly hit Fay’s abdomen with his sword. Kindness was considered Tlue’s strong point. Regardless of who he fought against, he would show mercy and didn’t resort to underhanded means. However, that was Tlue’s naivety, or rather, his arrogance.　</p>
<p>“—Is-isn’t this enough?”　</p>
<p>“Not yet…”</p>
<p>It was the gaze of a man who sought desperately for something. Regardless of how many times Fay fell to the ground and was beaten down. Even if Tlue only used gentle strikes to hit Fay, it had to still feel painful nonetheless.　</p>
<p>“I won’t… be defeated here.”　</p>
<p>“Why!”</p>
<p>Tlue naturally increased the strength of his grip. It was out of fear. The thing that was happening at that moment was something unacceptable to him.　</p>
<p>—Those were the eyes of people, nay, starving wolves who sought power.　</p>
<p>Within Fay’s eyes, Tlue felt something similar to a muddy abyss.　</p>
<p>The orphans around were also baffled. Was that a face of Fay they never knew of before? It was totally different, a downright foreign thing.　</p>
<p>“Not… yet… the match isn’t over… it’s not over yet!”　</p>
<p>“—! Uh- uwaaaaahh!”</p>
<p>It was fear. It was a vague, underlying sense of great terror. It was the first time Tlue, nay, the main protagonist of Round Table Heroes, learned to fear something beyond his understanding.　</p>
<p>The person in front of him appeared to be a monster.</p>
<p>Tlue desperately tried to erase the overlapping image from his eyes, swinging his sword more vigorously. But they were stopped by Sister Maria.　</p>
<p>“That’s it! What are you doing?!”　</p>
<p>When the person who Tlue considered his elder sister and loved as family came to the scene, he came back to his senses. Tlue was ashamed of himself as he knew he had gone too far.　</p><div class="watas-bdb45e3c44ba753b67024ebde2816e0f watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-bdb45e3c44ba753b67024ebde2816e0f"></div>
<p>Now as he looked at what he had done, he could see Fay before him, wounded all over.　</p>
<p>“Tlue, why did you do that!?”　</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>“Fay! Are you…”</p>
<p>“—No way, he fainted while he was standing…”</p>
<p>Both Sister Maria and Tlue were at a loss for words. Fay must have reached his limit and fainted. Even so, this person still stood upright in his spot. He went beyond his limit and still stood due to the obstinacy of his soul.</p>
<p>Was there anyone who went that far for power?　</p>
<p>The protagonist Tlue never forgot about the events of this day for it carved a fear deep into his memory.</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
<p>T/N:</p>
<p>For the people who are new here, welcome! For those who have already accompanied me for some time, it’s my honor!</p>
<p>Anyway, due to the drop in the number of patrons, I decided to pick up this series as a patron exclusive, to give early access for the novel translation. Well, maybe the novel will eventually be released for the public, but that will be after I secured enough chapters for the patreon side and assembled enough people willing to help with editing and QC-ing the stuff, so it will take quite some time. Also, the public release will be split due to chapter length, so the update speed for later may vary.</p>
<p>Well anyway, leaving my circumstances aside, I picked this novel due to how it interests me, the usual comedic misunderstanding which is right up my alley. I think people will enjoy it.</p>
<p>As for the names, leaving the obvious &#8220;Maria&#8221; aside, &#8220;Tlue&#8221; is basically &#8220;True,&#8221; it’s just me changing r to l to avoid confusion if true appears not as a name. As for &#8220;Fay,| it came from both &#8220;Fake&#8221; and the Fay of Morgan Le Fay, its a round table heroes game and so, Arthurian names will appear after all.</p>
<p>Well then, this series might last for some time, but have fun while it lasts!</p>
