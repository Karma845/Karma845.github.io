<h3>Chapter 01: Common Warts and HPV</h3>



<p class="calibre1">Many days passed, and now it was the middle of February 1147. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As usual, the imperial capital was cold and snowy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palle had taken back his only life from the clutches of death and survived leukemia through  complete  hematological  remission.  Now  he  was  undergoing  maintenance therapy in order to keep the leukemia in remission. His progress was favorable as there were no visible leukemia cells under a microscope. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">TN: the author explicitly states that Pal e is undergoing chemotherapy. As Pal e has already</i> <i class="calibre3">reached complete remission the author is likely referring to maintenance therapy, which</i> <i class="calibre3">can take several years and may include occasional chemotherapy. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to prevent an infection, Palle refrained from going outside. Instead, he wrote at an astounding pace. Aided by the speed of his ink brush, Falma completed a series of textbooks titled “de Medicis’s New Foundations of Biopharmacy”, each of which was almost 1in thick. Bruno then arranged for them to be bound and sold to various medical and pharmaceutical universities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(It’s been a long time since I wrote a book, huh) In his previous life, Falma had published several textbooks on pharmacology. However, when he picked up one of the pristine textbooks that the mimeograph had printed, he couldn’t help but be deeply moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">TN: Falma compares the thickness of the textbook to his intermediate phalanx, in case</i> <i class="calibre3">you were wondering </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma gave El en a copy of the textbook so she could be the first to read it. El en accepted the textbook, which had been wrapped, and put on her glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Al ow me to humbly read this, Professor Falma, and may you please continue to provide guidance and encouragement” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>

<p class="calibre1">“What’s the matter, did you eat something weird?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma asked Ellen sarcastically after watching her act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a very impressive feat, did Falma-kun and Palle-kun write all of this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We each wrote about half, and Lotte drew a picture of the human body” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte was also the court painter, and her illustration of the human body turned the textbook from an amateur production into something much more professional. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lotte-chan is really talented too, isn’t she? I’ll have to study this textbook a few times before I start university” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right, because I’m going to get you to take a course, so make sure you read it… </p>
<p class="calibre1">now that I’ve finished this, I have nothing to regret in life” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the two brothers had poured their heart and soul into this. Falma had taught the bare minimum of his pharmacology knowledge to Palle and  even  then,  it  was  still  a  heavy  burden  for  Palle  to  learn  it  all  at  once.  Palle’s intelligence was a big help, thought Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Palle wasn’t able to learn everything, Falma couldn’t just ask for a replacement. He would’ve had to write the entire textbook himself and, in the process, would’ve worked himself to death again. When Palle returned from Novaroot half a year ago, he was an annoying and tiresome sibling, but now he was a brother who could be relied upon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Similarly, Palle also held his brother in high regard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re only 12 years old, don’t go saying stuff like that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen scolded Falma for looking too far ahead into the future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right, you still have an entire life ahead of you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte also encouraged Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma, who seemed to be burned out, thought that if he were to disappear from this world right now, at least he left behind a small amount of knowledge. In fact, he had left behind everything from general knowledge to specific details on medicine and biology, as well as detailed information on pharmacology. Furthermore, he also wrote </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>

<p class="calibre1">down the molecular structures for all the drugs and chemical reactions that he knew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That way, when science and technology has sufficiently advanced and drug development is possible, they can go through Falma’s notes one by one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma hoped that they’ll be able to surpass what Falma remembers of Earth’s modern-day medical sciences and start the next chapter of their world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lotte, Cedric-san, if you’d like, please take a look” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma hands Lotte and Cedric the same packages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you very much, Falma-sama” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cedric humbly accepted the gift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eh, something this precious, are you sure!? I don’t even understand what it’s about! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’ll just be wasted on me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A smile lit up Lotte’s face, since she never expected to receive something like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You were responsible for the illustrations, so of course you should receive a copy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also, there are some things you should read, such as the section on emergency first aid. I left a bookmark there” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the three unwrapped the textbooks, they found a pelt bookmark with a gem of their favorite color attached. It was Falma’s gift to them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Falma-kun is really diligent, isn’t he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell me I’m the best” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re the best” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cedric playfully praised Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ara, Falma-san real y is great. Oh, I forgot to deliver the medicine for Ambroise-san’s husband to her!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambroise-san works as a merchant and is Falma’s patient because he’s suffering from chronic gastritis. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>

<p class="calibre1">“Oh no! I’ll go deliver it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Falma put on his black haori and prepared to go outside, Lotte quickly grabbed the prescription bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll go! If it’s the Ambroise’s mansion, then I’ll be familiar with it” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really? Well, thank you. If you would be so kind” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte out of the pharmacy as fast as the wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">TN: gastritis is when your stomach lining is inflamed, could cause nausea and even vomiting. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma went downstairs to the first floor and handed out textbooks to the part-time pharmacists. The Other World Pharmacy currently employs three part-time pharmacists for Falma and Ellen’s convenience. They were chatting during their break, but when they saw Falma’s figure they stopped and stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A textbook…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It would be useful if they read it during their free time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My brother and I wrote it. Please read it, even if it’s little by little” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you very much. I’ll humbly read it” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma had recruited Roger, a first-class pharmacist, from the Kingdom of Nedale while he was unemployed. Although he wasn’t very fluent in the Kingdom of San Fleuve’s language, he was still very talented. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Th-th-thank you, shopkeeper-sama. I’ll commit this book to memory” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rebecca, a second-class pharmacist who recently graduated from university, looked delighted. However, she had a very timid personality and stuttered whenever she was talking with Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mmm, it’s not necessary to memorize it. As long as you read and understand it, it’s fine” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>

<p class="calibre1">“This looks difficult. I’ll study it after I put the children to bed” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A part-time worker who held many jobs, Celeste was a lionhearted mother of several kids.  She’s  a  second-class  pharmacist  and  was  quick  at  prescribing  medicine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, she’s also an alumnus of Novaroot Medical University. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s fine to take your time, you know” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don’t want to be a burden, thought Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Falma-kun, you have enough pharmacists, right? I’m going to head out for a bit” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be careful” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen had patients of her own even before she started working with Falma. They were all powerful aristocrats and nobles. Every week, Ellen takes half a day off to care for them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well then, I should do my best this afternoon as well” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before his lunch break was over and immediately after Lotte had left on her errand, a carriage stopped in front of the pharmacy. The gatekeeper came to call for Falma, so he knew that a noble had come to visit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unless they’re seriously sick, Falma typically wouldn’t greet a visitor in person just because they’re nobility. However, if the visitor was a patron, he’d greet them no matter what their social status was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, are you still on vacation?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, it’s her excellence, the baroness Me lodie le Roux. It’s alright, welcome!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma bowed his head. The Empire’s best metal and glass worker, Me lodie, stepped out of the carriage. This was her first time in a pharmacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">TN: Remember, in the light novels Falma treated Mélodie for the first time in Volume 2 </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Chapter 9, but he did so by visiting her in person. The manga switched this up by skipping</i> <i class="calibre3">the treatment and having Mélodie visit Falma in Chapter 15. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Me lodie’s hair was long  and her  makeup was perfect,  making  her  look even more </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>

<p class="calibre1">beautiful. She wore a white dress with a bustle, which was popular among the citizens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A delightful-looking dark-blue ribbon lined the frills of the dress. That the baroness Me lodie was able to go outside dressed so fancily was proof that her condition had stabilized. She took off her fluffy feathered hat and nodded at Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">TN: There was a description of what a bustle looks like but I had a hard time translating</i> <i class="calibre3">it while doing it justice, so just Google “Victorian bustle” if you’re curious </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, Falma-sama! I appreciated your gift and letter of gratitude the other day” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma  had  Me lodie  make  compressed  oxygen  canisters  for  Palle’s  treatment,  and naturally he sent her a thank-you letter afterwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Likewise, thank you for helping with the commission for the compressed air tank. To make something as large as complicated as that in just a single day… my brother’s life was saved thanks to you. He’s very grateful” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me lodie’s swift work had helped both Falma and Palle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was it good? Could it withstand the internal pressure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, there was no problem. It was wonderful” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that so? Well then, I’m relieved. By the way, could I trouble you to give me a medical examination when you’re free?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me lodie had come to pick up her medicine for her schizophrenia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since he last saw her, Me lodie was now able to control her schizophrenia and tension headache  attacks  and  seemed  to  be  in  good  condition.  Falma  examined  her  while listening to her butler describe her day-to-day routine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Me lodie-sama appears to be in very good health. Her work is very fulfilling… she goes on walks during the day, explores her territory, and works on her commissions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Recently, she also started going to evening parties” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The butler was happy to report on Me lodie’s condition. At this stage of treatment for schizophrenia, it’s very easy to relapse and develop other types of mental illnesses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore,  during  treatment  patients  may  be  lethargic  or  experience  cognitive dysfunction. Fortunately, Me lodie didn’t seem to be experiencing any of those symptoms. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>

<p class="calibre1">“Is that so? That’s good. Let’s reduce the dosage of the medicine” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma  also  changed  the  combination of  drugs  used,  so he  instructed  the  butler  to inform him if anything unusual happens. With schizophrenia, it was necessary to not only observe the patient, but also the surrounding environment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is there any chance that I can stop taking the medicine?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In your current state, you could stop taking the medicine” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a relieved expression on her face, baroness Me lodie realized that she could finally live a “normal” life. However, Falma continued, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although Falma’s divine sight confirmed that Me lodie’s condition was improving, it wasn’t time to celebrate yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If  you  suddenly  stop  taking  the  medicine,  there’s  a  very  high  chance  that  the schizophrenia will come back. In order to prevent this, let’s keep taking the medicine for now” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I understand” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me lodie  understood.  Falma  explained  that  given  the  especially  good  progress,  she needed to endure for just a little longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want to live my life in a cage anymore. Thanks to Master Falma’s medicine, I can spend the rest of my life in good health. You’re my benefactor. You gave me the gift of helping me recover my sanity” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I should be thanking you instead” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From Falma’s point of view, his large orders of equipment for use at the Marseille pharmaceutical factory was always completed on time and as requested, so he had no right to object to Me lodie’s unreasonable demands here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now then, I’ve hindered the other customers, so please excuse me” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me lodie, smiling sweetly, stood up and brushed her hair back. It was at this moment </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>

<p class="calibre1">that Falma suddenly had an uncomfortable feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please, wait a moment. Me lodie-sama, may I see your hand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah… what for? I’m a bit ashamed to show you” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me lodie hid her fingers from Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why are you ashamed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s because I have the hands of a craftsman. They’ve grown a lot of calluses from handling tools” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because Me lodie felt bashful, she nervously held out both hands in front of Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have they increased recently?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wonder if it’s because the continuing orders with quick deadlines” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It didn’t seem like Me lodie understood the cause. However, Falma still smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, that’s not it. Although there are some calluses, about half of these are warts. Did you scrape this part?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A part of the wart was flat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I wasn’t feeling well so I scraped it with a knife…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma informed Me lodie why that was a problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It may have caused them to increase” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Verruca vulgaris</i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma used his divine eye to confirm the disease – “verruca”, more commonly known as “warts”. Falma took Me lodie’s hand and brought it near his face to inspect the blood vessels under the warts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These warts were caused by viruses” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>

<p class="calibre1">Falma explains the concept of viruses to Me lodie. Warts usually form in places where the skin is injured so Me lodie, as a craftsman, must have hurt her hands a lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Currently, there are no drugs which can cure this virus” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The human papillomavirus (HPV) has infected deep into the skin of Me lodie’s palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No way… it won’t heal? It’ll be very embarrassing if this increases” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“However, there may be drugs which can treat this… please give me a moment” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was impossible to judge the effectiveness of liquid nitrogen as a treatment using Falma’s divine eye, so he checked some other drugs instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Salicylic acid</i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Glutaraldehyde</i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a way to soften the stratum corneum of the wart, but it’s not always effective. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this case, it doesn’t seem like it will work for Me lodie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, Lotte had just returned to the pharmacy from her errand and saw Falma unexpectedly grabbing Me lodie’s hand and bringing it close to his face. She was startled and quickly hid in the pharmacy’s shadows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ehh?! Just now… could that have been… a ki-“ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kiss? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Based on appearances, that’s what it looked like. A kiss on the palm rather than the back of the hand from a man to a woman surely meant it was a proposal. “Falma and Me lodie had that sort of relationship…?”, thought Lotte, confused. “Come to think of it, Falma went to Me lodie’s mansion several times while he was treating her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Falma must have slowly became more intimate with Me lodie during that time… I didn’t realize it at all” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  unusual  for  Falma  to  touch  a  woman’s  body,  unless  it  was  for  a  medical examination. Besides, Me lodie’s hand wasn’t diseased. Falma rarely even touched Lotte, that’s how intimate this situation was. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>

<p class="calibre1">If you think about it, Falma and Me lodie are both nobles, and Me lodie is also an baroness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As such, despite the age difference she was still the best partner for Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that’s how it is…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To Falma, Lotte was just a servant. As she thought that, she felt a wave of misery and looked down at her hands. They were smooth despite Lotte’s work in the kitchen due to the lotion that Falma makes for her. Lotte didn’t think she could ask for anything more than this… </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wonder if I’ll have to leave the de Medicis family’s mansion if I get married… maybe I’ll only get to see Falma-sama at the pharmacy” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haaaa… A sigh escaped Lotte’s lips as she considered her bleak future. She began to absentmindedly play with the nearby snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Falma had finished examining Me lodie’s hand. He was completely ignorant of what had just happened, and instead began to explain the treatment process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s no way around it. We’ll freeze the warts using liquid nitrogen. After that, you can return to your mansion for some tea” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s no cure for verruca vulgaris, so the typical treatment is to use liquid nitrogen to freeze the skin until it becomes necrotic. Then, the infected area can be shaved off little by little. It’s normal to not use any anesthesia when treating with liquid nitrogen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there may be a sharp pain, so it was important that Me lodie didn’t accidentally activate her flames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me lodie is a flame arts user, so if she accidentally evaporates the liquid nitrogen, then the treatment can’t continue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me lodie looked puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What would you prefer? A way that may hurt more, but takes less treatments, or a way that may hurt less, but takes more treatments?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m in pain, so it’s better if it doesn’t hurt” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>

<p class="calibre1">Me lodie was scared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Understood, today we’ll try a treatment that doesn’t hurt. Let’s start by applying the anesthetic” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma spread some ointment containing Lidocain onto Me lodie’s fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let me know when your hand is numb so I know whether the anesthetic is effective. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alright, next person please” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma began to examine the  steadily increasing number of  patients while Me lodie waited in the counseling corner to avoid being a nuisance. Slowly, as Falma examined patient after patient, the sensation in Me lodie’s fingertips disappeared. She once again admired how reliable and talented Falma was, despite only being a child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think the anesthetic worked” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me lodie showed Falma her hands </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Understood” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma left for the compounding room </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Liquid nitrogen</i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liquid nitrogen at -196 °C was materialized into a low-temperature-resistant container and a cotton swab was dipped into the fluid. This caused the tip of the swab to freeze and maintain a super-low temperature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well then, let’s freeze it” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma returned to the store and applied liquid nitrogen on the warts on Me lodie’s hand using the swab. While prolonged exposure to liquid nitrogen is usually very painful, short bursts don’t hurt as much.  Furthermore,  Me lodie is anesthetized, so she felt almost no pain at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it over already?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, it’s fine for now, but please come back in 5 days so we can freeze the virus before it starts growing again. We’ll remove it immediately” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">With that, the treatment was completed. Falma also gave Me lodie some Job’s Tears tea, which is very effective against warts caused by papillomavirus. Falma had grown a lot of it in Marseille, and as such the pharmacy had a lot in stock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you very much, I’m so relieved” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me lodie expressed her gratitude and paid Falma </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hope you get well soon” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Ellen returned from treating her patients, she found Lotte sitting on the stairs in front of the pharmacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lotte-chan, what happened here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of the pharmacy were numerous snowmen which Lotte had absentmindedly built  with  the  snow  that  had  fallen  onto  the  ground.  They  were  so  beautiful,  they seemed like they would come to life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, as a result Lotte’s hands had turned red and swollen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh my, you built all this with your bare hands even though your guardian deity isn’t the water god… what happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I got immersed in building the snowmen, and now my hands really hurt” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte sadly sniffled </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That much is obvious. At this rate you’ll get frostbite. Well… there’s no other choice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll apply some of the de Medicis’ cream, so it should heal in about a week” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen tried to go inside to get the medicine, but Lotte tugged on her coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aaaa! Don’t go inside, Ellen-sama!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, why’s that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s- Me lodie-sama is inside right now… with Falma-sama…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So he’s treating her, right? What’s wrong with that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>

<p class="calibre1">Lotte was flustered </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Falma-sama is proposing right now… so I don’t think we should interrupt them” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ehhh? Proposing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen’s voice cracked out of shock at hearing those words </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Falma-kun’s proposing… so there was someone he liked after al ! He’s normal y so quiet” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen still thought of Falma as a child, but at 12 years old it wasn’t unreasonable to be thinking about marriage. Ellen’s father, the Count, had started introducing her to love stories little by little, so it was also at the back of her mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Falma-kun, you’re growing up” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, Me lodie exited the pharmacy with her butler. She looked very happy and cheerful y bid farewell to Ellen and Lotte with a “goodbye, thanks for taking care of me”. Then she entered her carriage and departed for her mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen whispered to Lotte </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She seemed happy, but I think that’s natural. Aaaa, did Me lodie-sama accept Falma-sama’s proposal? Falma-sama is such a gentleman, even Me lodie-sama…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It sounded as though Lotte’s very soul had escaped her. Suddenly, and with terrible timing, Falma spoke up from behind the two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks for running the errand, Lotte. Were you late? Ah, Ellen’s here too” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was no big deal. I think some kids came to play in front of the pharmacy… which is why there are so many snowmen” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte was startled by Falma’s question and came up with an excuse </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lotte-chan built so many snowmen that she’ll going to get frostbite” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ehhh… let me see” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>

<p class="calibre1">Falma was surprised and reached out for Lotte’s hands. The warmth of Falma’s hands that were nonchalantly extended caused Lotte’s heart to race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Falma-sama, you can’t! You already have Me lodie-sama” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte quickly pushed away Falma’s hands so as to not hurt Me lodie’s feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right, Falma-kun. You shouldn’t be so promiscuous” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen agreed with Lotte </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you saying?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Falma heard the story, he laughed in embarrassment. It was a funny story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was just examining Me lodie’s hand, since there were warts” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really? Is that really true?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte trusted Falma, and her voice rose in delight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did you think it was?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing in particular!” </p>
