<h2>Chapter 1 &#8211; The Journey to Belifaire</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day, I——Haruto Yuki, a high school student, was suddenly summoned to another world together with my whole class as a hero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, because I didn’t possess the title of ‘Hero’, I was kicked out, and nearly killed by the summoners, the Kingdom of Glicente.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, I met an existence who claimed to be a god, and with the help of the numerous cheat skills I acquired from him, I began to work as an adventurer in the Kingdom of Perdis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, I became an EX rank adventurer, the highest adventurer rank ever attained, and together with other adventurers and the elves whose villages were attacked by Glicente, I took revenge on the Kingdom of Glicente.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, I rebuilt the internal administration of Glicente, sent the other heroes to the Nargadia Labyrinth to train them, made the boss of the labyrinth, a dragon, into my companion, and then finally set up my own trading company in the Kingdom of Perdis&#8230;I was just living up my otherworldly life to the fullest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My next destination is the Galzio Empire, where a fighting tournament is to be held. I was planning to test the strength of my companions at the tournament. Then, I heard that we would be passing through a country called the Holy State of Belifaire, so we decided to stop by.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are eight members on this trip, including me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, is my fiancee, Finne, an adventurer. Followed by Iris, the princess of the Kingdom of Perdis and also my fiancee, and her attendant Asha. Then we have Suzuno, one of the heroes summoned to this world along with me, also my fiancee; Ephyr, the former princess of the elven village; Kusel, a former knight of Glicente; and Zero, the dragon who was the boss monster of the Nargadia labyrinth but transformed into a human and decided to follow me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our destination, the capital of the Holy State of Belifaire, is two weeks away by carriage from the royal capital of the Kingdom of Perdis, where we currently are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The border is about halfway, or about a week&#8217;s ride away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like a long journey from the perspective of my original world, but for the inhabitants of this world, a trip of this level is one of the shortest. I, for one, have become quite accustomed to the awareness of this world, so I don&#8217;t feel it at all burdensome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the journey, there were times when monsters and bandits appeared, but everyone took the initiative in defeating the monsters, and Zero in particular proactively sought out the bandits before they even got close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, the bandits were often relieved of their loots after they were defeated, which also provided unexpected extra income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I had a lot of free time during the trip, and I spent a lot of time napping on top of the carriage. Sometimes, when Kusel wanted to spar, I would indulge her in the subspace beyond the door of the carriage, which I had created——a separate world where everyone usually spent their time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a checkpoint at the border along the road, but we were able to pass through it easily by showing a dagger with the emblem of the Kingdom of Perdis and my EX rank adventurer&#8217;s card.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon entering the Holy State of Belifaire, the roads were clean and well-maintained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The journey was peaceful, with occasional passing merchants and adventurer-like carriages on their way to the Kingdom of Perdis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A certain day after entering the Holy State of Belifaire and back on our journey, I asked a question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Does anyone know why the appearance of monsters has decreased considerably since we crossed the border?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris answered my question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s because the holy knights in the holy city regularly exterminate the monsters. It&#8217;s an age-old practice to make it safer for merchants to come and go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ohh, they must have proper considerations for the people then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, the country itself has the power to do so and more after all. That is why the entire Holy State of Belifaire, including the holy city we are about to visit, is economically developed and has an abundance of food.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, if there were fewer monsters, bandits, and the like, it would be easier for merchants to gather.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I suddenly remembered something and asked Asha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asha. I noticed there aren’t that many adventurers passing by, is there no adventurers’ guild in the holy city?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, there is. As the princess said, the holy knights exterminate the monsters, but the adventurers&#8217; guild also exterminates the monsters along the road. Obviously, the holy knights alone can’t handle it all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha is right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there&#8217;s one thing still bothering me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do they do when powerful monsters appear?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are no S-rank adventurers in this country, so I guess they pull everyone together to deal with it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There aren’t?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they do, then this country is doomed&#8230;well, if they thinned them out regularly, I guess they wouldn’t have to worry about such strong monsters showing up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that thought in mind, I was about to climb back up on top of the carriage when I felt a gaze behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned around and saw that Finne was looking at me with a dumbfounded expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Another nap&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, the weather is so nice, it’s making me sleepy. We’ve already had lunch too. Don&#8217;t you ever get sleepy, Finne?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, sometimes&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne quickly turned away after saying that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seems to be sleepy, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Would you like to join me? It&#8217;s nice and breezy up here, so how about it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne was still somewhat hesitant, but Asha took care of it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s okay, Finne, I’ll take the reins.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, Asha. Th-Then, I&#8217;ll take you up on it&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne, a little embarrassed, climbed up on top of the carriage with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top is reinforced with magic, so there’s no fear of it tearing down from the weight of two people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankly speaking, unless it’s pierced by a reinforced armor-piercing arrow or something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the two of us lay down and let the rattling carriage rock us, Finne suddenly muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is so nice&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s so sunny and warm, with a pleasant breeze. On days like this, it&#8217;s best to just sleep outside.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now I know why Haruto has been napping here all this time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we were talking about such things, Finne and I fell asleep before we knew it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I woke up a short time later, the sky was tinged with an azure hue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To my right, Finne was sleeping comfortably.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I noticed something strange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone was also sleeping on my left side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked over to see Suzuno, who was sleeping just as comfortably as Finne.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that she had noticed that Finne and I were sleeping and had climbed up without us even realizing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I woke them up, and went jumped down to look for a nice spot where we could camp out for the night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were only a few days away from the capital of the Holy State of Belifaire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During break, I was feeding my beloved horse, Maguro who has been pulling the carriage, some fruit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maguro. We’re almost there, so just hang in there, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Neighh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maguro seemed to be in great form today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Finne came over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, having come this far, have you decided exactly what you want to do in the holy city?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well&#8230;I&#8217;m mainly interested in sightseeing mostly. And maybe eat some of the local specialties if there are any.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I answered Finne’s question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our main purpose is to participate in the Galzio Empire&#8217;s tournament. After all, our trip to the holy city is strictly for sightseeing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iris. What kind of country is the Holy State of Belifaire?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuno asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t know much about it myself, and I&#8217;m only curious because I heard from Dillan, the King of Perdis, that it is a nation based on a religion that worships God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, who was asked the question, explained while placing her index finger on her chin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmmm, well&#8230;there&#8217;s no discrimination between races, like beastkin and the like&#8230;come to think of it, Perdis doesn&#8217;t discriminate against other races either, so I guess there’s that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ohh, ain’t that nice of ‘em.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris continued, after my witty remark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Also, there are hardly any slaves in Belifaire. In fact, they even reject the idea.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But are there any?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, a few. Still, I heard that criminal slaves alone contribute to keeping the holy city clean.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. So they&#8217;re like clean-up crews.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I changed the subject and asked Ephyr who seemed to be dozing off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ephyr. Sorry to interrupt your sleep, but have you been in touch with Aegan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan is the name of the elf that I left behind in Glicente to keep an eye on the queen and princess of Glicente.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr answered the question in a stupor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. I have been communicating with Aegan through letters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good. Is everything all right back in Glicente?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ministers and the heroes seem to be doing all right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s good. I&#8217;ll leave it to them to keep it up. The next time we meet will be when we defeat the Demon King.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Defeat the Demon King?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel&#8217;s eyes widened at the mention of “defeating the Demon King”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-What&#8217;s up with you all of a sudden, Kusel?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh, nothing. I was just curious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe we&#8217;ve been talking about this for quite a while now, so I wonder what that was about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Demon King huh~. I have no idea what the Demon King is up to, but I&#8217;m sure each country has its own agenda, so I guess it’s still too early to say what will happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it comes down to it, I will just defeat him and be done with. But that&#8217;s not my role, that&#8217;s the role of the heroes. Well, I may end up having to go with them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a good chance they&#8217;ll ask me to go with them, and even if they don’t, I&#8217;ll still go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel nodded, “I see”, seemingly convinced, but her expression was somewhat vacant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right cut the crap, why is it bothering you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;d like to try fighting it at least once!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not that again&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn&#8217;t help slamming her with the retort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s beyond saving&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone laughed at Kusel&#8217;s words, seeing as she’s the same as ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s so funny?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris replied to Kusel who was getting furious as if to make an excuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well&#8230;hehee, you said you wanted to try fighting the Demon King, so I thought, that’s so like you, Kusel, hehee”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess, you&#8217;re being rude!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha chastised her, but Iris replied while still laughing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, it’s true&#8230;is it not? Even you, Asha, didn’t you laugh as well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But, at least I get where she’s coming from&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yup, Asha laughed too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversation between the two of them was making Kusel shudder——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stop laughinggggg!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She exclaimed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next to her, Zero, who had been reading a book with one hand, turned to me and asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Master Haruto. How long will we be staying in the capital?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, I&#8217;m thinking maybe a week.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. May I buy a few books then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, but are there any that interest you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you very much. I have been in the labyrinth for a long time, so I thought I would accumulate knowledge of this era. Information is the most valuable commodity in any age after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Zero has been reading a lot. As he says, his main purpose seems to be to gather information, but it appears he’s become a typical bookworm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I let him read Japanese manga, would he get hooked as well? It’s really hard to say, and first of all, since there’s really no way of getting one, I can’t really say if he would actually like it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I just hope nothing goes wrong in the holy city.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I muttered to myself, and everyone froze except for Zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, like a machine that hadn’t been lubricated, they all turned their heads and stared at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wh-What is it&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Suzuno who answered my puzzled question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please tell me you didn’t just say that, Haruto! Please tell me you didn’t!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a splendid flag he just erected, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris followed suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s no way that Haruto goes somewhere and nothing happens. Right, Ephyr, Asha?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;re right, princess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“True. I guess Iris and Asha are right about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; &#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Kusel nodded in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned my expectant gaze to Finne hoping that she would back me up, but&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s so spot-on that I can’t even think of anything else to add. I guess we better brace ourselves since something is definitely going to happen when we get there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; &#8230; &#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was being treated like a complete troublemaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt so sad and my vision blurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh hold on&#8230;somehow I think I’ve got sweat in my eyes!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““That&#8217;s tears!”””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone except Zero put me on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gsshhh&#8230;so sad&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few days later, we arrived at the capital safely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s kinda white&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was my first impression of the city from afar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, it&#8217;s white.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So white&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s really white.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne, Ephyr and Suzuno murmured in agreement with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s exactly as it sounded, everywhere we looked in the holy city, was pure white.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there were some brown buildings in some places, the city was basically white and beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve been here before so I already knew.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve also been here before as the princess&#8217;s attendant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mine was during a military expedition.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, Asha, and Kusel had been here before, apparently. Zero was like, “It&#8217;s beautiful”, and then went back to reading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iris. What is that palace or cathedral-like structure at the center of the city?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s the Belifaire Cathedral.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A structure that could be described as a castle or a palace. It looked like the Milan Cathedral in Italy back in my original world. But many times bigger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I am not an expert in architecture, I thought it was very beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So that&#8217;s the cathedral, huh? It’s so cool.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everyone who sees it for the first time gets the same impression.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess so. I was also surprised when I saw it for the first time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris and Asha said so, and Kusel nodded in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We arrived in front of the outer wall that surrounds the holy city and lined up to go through the checkpoints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris was afraid that things might get complicated if she entered the country as a princess, so she decided to enter as an adventurer, and Asha also changed the way she addressed her from “Princess” to “Lady Iris”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it got to my turn, the person in charge at the checkpoint seemed surprised to see my adventurer rank and the presence of an elf, but he let me through without any problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so we set foot inside the holy city.</span></p>
