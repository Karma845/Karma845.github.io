<h1>Prologue: The Princess Is Staring At Me</h1>

<div class="text-left">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Raize. The princess is watching you again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t have to tell me, Elt-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sitting at the benches in the gardens of the Royal Palace, I spilled a sigh. My colleague, Elt-san, sat next to me. I stopped eating the homemade sandwich in my hand and turned my gaze toward the fountain in the center of the gardens. A woman was peeking at us from behind it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure you haven’t done anything? Hasn’t she been staring at you all week?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, more than a week…”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, it’s been several.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I really don’t know why she keeps watching me… Lately, it’s all that’s been on my mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t think she’d hate such a well-mannered guy…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elt-san put down his sandwich, crossed his arms, and made a troubling gesture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you offend her somehow?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me? It’s impossible. Come on, I’m a court magician, and she’s the princess of our country. Sure, we cross paths sometimes in the royal palace, but other than that we don’t interact.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not knowing the cause, I sighed again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elt-san wiped his hands and drank some tea. Tea from my flask, by the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no reason for it. We’re in completely different social castes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I searched my memories as hard as I could, trying to remember the actions and words and deeds I’d done since I had come to the kingdom. After a minute of fruitless thinking─</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nope, nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s nothing that rings a bell.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe you just forgot?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I doubt it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I had an audience with the princess, I would certainly remember it. Well, it was true that I’d see her sometimes, considering I worked in the royal palace, but I never talked to her or did anything rude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wish I knew how this situation came about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, here’s an idea.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elt-san raised his index finger in a flash and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d known him for a few months now, and when he smiled like this, he was usually thinking about something weird. I couldn’t trust him.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">…Do I ask him? Not that I expect anything to come of it.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just ask her directly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…? What are you talking about?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Directly… the princess?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who else is there?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, no.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That would be too difficult. Even though we both frequented the royal palace, she wasn’t someone I could talk to. If I were unlucky, it could spell the end of my life as a court magician. My neck could be blown off. Realistically speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wouldn’t want that to happen. I had arrived here only months ago, after finally leaving my village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve been lucky enough to become a court magician, so I’d rather not end my life here. Please don’t say anything that would hasten the death of your junior.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry. No one would sentence you to death for simply talking to her…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really, now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at Elt-san nervously, prompting him to laugh dryly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, maybe someone would. When humans have power, they do things that don’t make sense.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks, I’m even more worried now… Well, I don’t think the princess would do that. She’s known for being very kind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s also very popular with the people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Royal Highness was a wonderful person both on the inside and outside, what with her beautiful appearance and benevolent, gentle personality. In no small part due to her presence, the royal family was well received by the citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, my eyes met those of the princess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our postures both immediately stiffened.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">In this kind of situation, I should move first.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Being absent-minded right now was not the best idea. The other party was a princess. If I even seemed disrespectful, my head could fly away!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stretched my mouth wide, trying to present a beaming smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“—Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The princess’s face turned a bright crimson. She bit her lip, then swiftly turned around and ran away. Her dazzling silver hair fluttered behind her.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">…Did you hate the thought of meeting me that much?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ohhhh, so that’s what this is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike me, who was tilting my head in confusion, Elt-san muttered meaningfully. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, yes, yes, yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then he slapped me on the shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You… are such a sinful guy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understood even less now. Nevertheless, Elt-san gave me a thumbs up and a mysterious smile. Soon after, I stood up and left the gardens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…What could it be?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On my list of recent worries and doubts:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The princess stares at me.</span></p>
