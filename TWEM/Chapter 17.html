<h2>Chapter 17 &#8211; Departure</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having shaken off Iris and the others, Ilmina and I found ourselves at an accessory shop. The shop assistant was initially surprised upon seeing Ilmina, but after looking at me, their expression seemed to convey a sense of understanding.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for saving Holy City from the devils&#8221;, the shop assistant bowed, and I replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it&#8221;, as we looked around the shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, Ilmina, what type of accessories do you like?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my question, Ilmina touched her lips with her index finger and replied, &#8220;Well&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I prefer simple and cute things over flashy ones.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So you don&#8217;t like flashy stuff?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not that I dislike it, but it gives off this&#8230; overly wealthy vibe&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, I can understand that feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So you feel the same, Ilmina?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You mean, you feel the same way, Haruto?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded at Ilmina&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah. I don&#8217;t like bulky, gaudy accessories either.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do most men feel that way too?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded without hesitation at Ilmina&#8217;s question. It&#8217;s just a personal preference, but I don&#8217;t have a very good impression of such accessories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad. I&#8217;m not good with flashy accessories either, and while I would be happy to receive it as a gift from Haruto, wearing it would be a bit of a problem.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina said this with a smile. I felt like I could make a promise to never wear bulky accessories for the rest of my life just to protect this smile. In fact, I decided not to!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was thinking about this, Ilmina hesitantly opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Could you help me choose which accessory to get?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina looked at me with hopeful eyes. Naturally looking up at me, due to our height difference. I quickly replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My response may have been a bit more spirited than necessary, but seeing Ilmina&#8217;s happiness, I took it as a win. I began looking through the accessories in the store one by one. Then, one particular accessory caught my eye. It was a silver ring with a greenish hue, designed to resemble a wreath, adorned with small pink and yellow flowers. I immediately showed it to Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you think of this one, Ilmina?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s beautiful and stylish. Plus, it&#8217;s simple and cute.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That settled it. It&#8217;s bound to suit such a pure and beautiful girl like her. I told the shop assistant, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take this one.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shop assistant took the item out of the glass case and showed it to me for confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Seeing it up close, it looks really beautiful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, it truly is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing our conversation, the shop assistant smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a masterpiece created by a skilled artisan who spent several months crafting it. As expected of a hero, you have a great eye. It will suit the Saint very well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other shop assistants nodded in agreement. We proceeded to check out, and honestly, I was taken aback by the price. It cost two platinum coins, equivalent to about 200 million yen. I hesitated for a moment, but an expense of this level wouldn&#8217;t hurt my wallet in the slightest. In fact, I felt relieved to have an opportunity to use some of the rewards I&#8217;ve been receiving. I should be careful, though, my sense of money might be getting skewed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had no idea it would be so expensive&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Ilmina was bewildered by the high price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. There&#8217;s no point in having money if you don&#8217;t use it. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s for.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I took out the platinum coins from my storage and paid. Then, without further ado, I received the accessory and put it on the ring finger of Ilmina&#8217;s left hand. Blushing, she brought the newly placed ring up to her face to admire it. She must be really happy; her mouth softened into a smile. I&#8217;m glad I bought it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By the way, does this accessory have a name?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shop assistant nodded in response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s called the &#8216;Ring of Sacred Flowers.'&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome. We look forward to your next visit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina and I left the shop. Before we knew it, it was already past noon. I spoke to Ilmina, who was still admiring her ring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you want to do? Head back to the cathedral a bit early?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, I think so. I&#8217;ve enjoyed myself enough, and it&#8217;s been a fulfilling day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my words, Ilmina smiled and nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for the ring. I&#8217;ll treasure it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure thing. Can I take a look at the ring for a moment?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took Ilmina&#8217;s left hand and enchanted the ring with magic. A faint light shone, but it quickly subsided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What did you just do?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I enchanted it with &#8216;Antidote&#8217; and &#8216;Automatic Mana Recovery.'&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina&#8217;s face showed surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can enchant items too. The automatic mana recovery is slow, so be mindful of that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you so much!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina, truly grateful, clenched her hand tightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon returning to the cathedral, I found Gawain, the Holy Knights, and Kuzel training with Zero in a corner of the garden. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What on earth were they doing? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne, who noticed me and Ilmina, approached us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, you&#8217;re back earlier than I thought.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As you can see.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I glanced at Ilmina, who had been smiling at her ring since we arrived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ilmina must be really happy with the present from you, Haruto.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems so. Anyway, what&#8217;s going on here? I didn&#8217;t expect to see Finne here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Apparently, Zero and Kuzel ran into Gawain while they were in town, and that led to this training session&#8230; I was participating too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne looked at the fallen Holy Knights, including Gawain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I tried fighting Gawain, but I lost,&#8221; she said, laughing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How did it go?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think I did well, but I still have a long way to go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain had been no match for Schwartz, but he was still the strongest Holy Knight. If Finne could hold her own against him, she must have become incredibly strong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is Sir Gawain, the leader of the Holy Knights, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina, who was watching the training session with Zero, asked, and I thought for a moment before answering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He should be&#8230; probably.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Probably?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sure Zero was holding back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We watched for a while, and eventually, the training ended, and Gawain collapsed. As expected, he was battered when I rushed over to check on him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Gawain, are you okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto? Is your date with Lady Ilmina over?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We just got back, actually. I came to drop off Ilmina.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain looked at Ilmina, who was wearing a happy expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. It&#8217;s good to see that you enjoyed yourselves&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Do you want me to cast healing magic?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gawain replied with a &#8220;please,&#8221; so I cast healing magic on everyone present. Gawain, borrowing my hand, stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you, you saved me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, how was it? Fighting against Zero?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s just too strong&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other Holy Knights nodded in agreement with Gawain&#8217;s words. Meanwhile, Kuzel was looking satisfied and chatting with Finne and Ilmina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You fought Finne and Kuzel too, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, I did&#8230; but aren&#8217;t they both too strong? I had quite a tough time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s good to hear. I think they should&#8217;ve beaten you up more, though.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, have some sympathy for your fellow man.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What are you talking about? Of course, I&#8217;ll side with my friends.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I suppose so&#8230; Anyway, even if all of us Holy Knights teamed up, we wouldn&#8217;t stand a chance against Master Zero. It&#8217;s a cruel joke that he&#8217;s not an adventurer or a knight but a butler.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huh? Master&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gawain, what do you mean by &#8216;Master&#8217;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I looked puzzled, I received an immediate explanation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, actually, as we practiced together, I realized there was so much to learn. I couldn&#8217;t help but ask if I could call him my master,&#8221; said Gawain, with Zero standing behind him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Welcome back, Lord Haruto. I had a good workout—now, Gawain, please become a bit stronger by the time we meet again. That goes for all of you too, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing Zero&#8217;s words, Gawain and the other knights responded with an enthusiastic &#8220;Yes!&#8221; I wondered if that was really okay, but I guess it was up to them, so there wasn&#8217;t a problem. As we chatted, news of our return must have reached Liebert, who came to see us. Apparently, while we were out, a new Cardinal had been chosen and there had been some personnel reviews. They said they had chosen carefully this time, so there was no need to worry about incidents like before. Still, it was important not to get complacent… As we discussed this, dusk approached, so we decided to return to our lodgings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon returning, I saw Iris and the other three engaged in a lively conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, you&#8217;re back already!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris called out as if nothing had happened, so I gave her a suspicious glare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let me ask you one thing, what were you guys up to today?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my question, Iris averted her gaze, while Suzuno, Asha, and Ephyr began to sweat nervously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wh-what do you mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, we were just hanging out together, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Suzuno&#8217;s right!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was with Iris and the others, as well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, Suzuno, Asha, and Ephyr replied, but their eyes wandered evasively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know what you&#8217;ve been up to, you know? Don&#8217;t think you can escape my senses.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re so sorry!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apologies of the four echoed throughout the inn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, we arrived at the northern gate of the divine capital. It would take about two weeks to reach our next destination, the capital of the Galzio Empire, departing from this gate. Many people had come to see us off at the gate, including Gawain and the other Holy knights, Liebert the Pope, and Ilmina, who had become my fiancée. First, Gawain stepped forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, we owe you. If it weren&#8217;t for you, not only the divine capital but our entire nation might have been doomed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that, Gawain. Thanks to the efforts of you and the other knights, I was able to make it in time. Be proud.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Thank you. With your words, the souls of those who have died can rest in peace. I&#8217;ll use this life, saved by their sacrifice, for the sake of our country.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next to speak was Liebert.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lord Haruto, we are grateful for your help. Even though you saved the divine capital, we have not been able to express our gratitude properly&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that. I didn&#8217;t do it for a reward&#8230; Besides, just meeting Ilmina is enough for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I placed my hand on Ilmina&#8217;s head, who was standing nearby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ha-Haruto!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person in question blushed furiously at my sudden gesture. Liebert smiled at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I won&#8217;t forgive you if you bring misfortune or sadness to her, alright?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you saying that as the Pope? That&#8217;s not it, is it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert smiled at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, as a father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I smiled at his answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Leave it to me. I&#8217;ll make her happy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s no one more reliable than you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert smiled again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well then, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I was about to leave, Ilmina grabbed my sleeve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ha-Haruto!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um&#8230; there&#8217;s some dust on your head.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hadn&#8217;t noticed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll get it, just bend down a little.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bent down as she requested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ilmina—&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I was about to ask if she got it, I felt a soft touch on my cheek and heard a cute smooching sound. Finne and the others gasped, and I quickly raised my head. Ilmina&#8217;s face turned even redder than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Th-that was for good luck!!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina hugged me and buried her face in my chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please, promise me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stroked her head as I responded to the words she had whispered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll be back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You promise?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina looked up at me with pleading eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I promise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…I understand. Please be careful, but I guess you don&#8217;t need me to tell you that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina took a deep breath and smiled broadly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please enjoy your journey. I&#8217;ll be waiting for your return.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alright, I&#8217;ll enjoy it to the fullest. Look forward to listening to my stories.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina stepped away from me, stood next to Liebert, and waved goodbye. I turned to Finne and the others and called out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alright, let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We boarded the carriage and left the Holy Capital. Our next destination was the Galzio Empire, a country we had never been involved with before. My heart raced, anticipating what awaited us in this new land.</span></p>
