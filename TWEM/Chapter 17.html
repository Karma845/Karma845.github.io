<h3>Chapter 17 &#8211; To the Galzio Empire</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we got home and were all eating lunch together, I mentioned that I was thinking of going to the Galzio Empire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Galzio Empire?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why so suddenly?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne and Ephyr raised their voices in question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I heard there&#8217;s going to be a tournament coming up real soon, and I wanted to see how much you all have improved. Ultimately, you’re free to decide whether to participate or not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our improvement, huh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne looked a little uneasy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Listen. I know you’ve all grown pretty strong, so this is more of testing your mettle. Of course Kusel will participate, or won&#8217;t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You bet I will! What about you, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I think I&#8217;ll just participate in the team competition. At any rate, you can decide whether or not you&#8217;re going to participate by the time we get to Galzio. On this journey, I will be touring the Holy State of Belifaire and will be on the road in time for the tournament&#8230;but just to be on the same page, everyone is coming with me, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course! Although I haven&#8217;t decided if I&#8217;ll be participating in the tournament.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne seems to be on board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It goes without saying that I&#8217;m coming with you as well, Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris answered, and Asha nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m already getting excited.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I&#8217;m coming!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-97818707' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-97818707' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSc5JyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8IS0tIEJsb2NrIDkuMSAtIERpc3BsYXkgQWZ0ZXIgcGFyYWdyYXBoIDAuMSAtLT4KPGlucyBjbGFzcz0iYWRzYnlnb29nbGUiCiAgICAgc3R5bGU9ImRpc3BsYXk6YmxvY2siCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1jbGllbnQ9ImNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtc2xvdD0iNjQ2MDkxNjYyMyIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWZvcm1hdD0iYXV0byI+PC9pbnM+CjxzY3JpcHQ+CiAgICAgKGFkc2J5Z29vZ2xlID0gd2luZG93LmFkc2J5Z29vZ2xlIHx8IFtdKS5wdXNoKHt9KTsKPC9zY3JpcHQ+' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel and Ephyr are down too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Suzuno——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course I&#8217;m coming along!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thought as much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her answer was immediate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, during the last trip, it already seemed like Suzuno was part of the group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Zero spoke out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“May I come with you as well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s unusual.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not really. It is my duty to protect my Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so, well, anything can happen, so I guess I’ll be relying on you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Zero in the mix, we won’t have to worry about anything along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero bowed to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then I asked Suzuno.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Speaking of which, where’s Tendo and the others? I haven&#8217;t seen them since yesterday&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re asking about them, then they’re with the Knight Order taking pointers, in order to become a little stronger, even if a bit they said!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They should be back today, probably.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just after saying that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The door to the dining room opened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re back! Whoa, Haruto, so you’re back already.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re finally back!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re back guys~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo, Mogami, Shinonome and Asakura appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Welcome back guys. You look like a wreck.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were training with the Knights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These guys are probably much stronger than the knights&#8230;did they learn how to fight from them or something?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh right, Haruto, we’re thinking of leaving here tomorrow and going back to Glicente for a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. We were also thinking of leaving Perdis and going to the Galzio Empire through the Holy State of Belifaire. There&#8217;s going to be a tournament. I’m having everyone participate in it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, a tournament, that sounds like fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you guys going to do when you get back to Glicente?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m going to have a discussion with the rest of our classmates. I still don’t think I’m strong enough to defeat the Demon King after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that&#8217;s a good idea. I hope everyone is doing well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That evening, we invited Bohbee and the other employees to a farewell party for Tendo and the others, which turned out to be a big party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next morning, we were gathered at the entrance to see Tendo and the others off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve been of tremendous help, Haruto. Thanks for everything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No shit, we even became stronger, so thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, Yuki.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks a lot, Yuki.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo, Mogami, Shinonome, and Asakura, in that order, each thanked me in turn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, Sebas and the others should be the ones deserving of their gratitude, not me&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure thing. Try not to die on your way back, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I’m that easily killed, I may as well piss on my title as a hero.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been some close calls though?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re ready for the expedition to defeat the Demon King, gimme a call. I&#8217;ll assist you as much as I can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s very encouraging.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;d hate to see any of my classmates kick the bucket.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hahaha&#8230;that&#8217;s true I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mogami, don’t limit yourself to just close-range combat, try learning one long-range magic spell of any kind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wouldn&#8217;t my fists get the job done much faster?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve gotta lose that mindset! Or you’ll be done in before you know it, sheesh.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-49166466' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-49166466' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, not happening!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I may be raising death flags by saying that, but guys like him live longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I moved on to Asakura.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You too, Asakura——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Call me Natsuki.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asakura, try not to bother Tendo so much, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told you, you could call me by my name!? And what do you mean by bothering him?! Do I do that?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like my life may be in danger if I so much as dare to call her by her first name right now. The pressure from the women behind me is no joke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Try and reflect on it&#8230;besides that, you just need to refine and master your magic spells more, I guess?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maybe not as proficient as you, Yuki, but I&#8217;ll get better at it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With that mindset, you&#8217;ll be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asakura&#8217;s smile brightens and cheers up those around her. I hope she is always in good spirits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, Shinonome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I leave everyone in your care.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What am I everyone&#8217;s guardian or something, Yuki?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not at all. You&#8217;re the calmest of them all, are you not? There you have it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Right. Thanks for the blade, I&#8217;ll take good care of it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good. You do that and make good use of it too, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one I had given her before was in bad shape, so I gave her a new one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh yeah, here&#8217;s one for each of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I took out some necklaces from my dimensional storage room and handed them out to the four of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inlaid into the necklace is a small red pearl the size of a pinky finger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo asked on behalf of everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;What is this, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a necklace that has the same effect as a skill that temporarily increases one&#8217;s abilities. You can appraise it for more details.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I explained the effect to the four who were stunned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The damage is at most a muscle ache, but if you use it continuously, the after-effects can be quite painful, so be careful.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, I had Kusel use the prototype, and the next day she could not move at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the boost in ability provided was staggering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of concern for Tendo and the others, I made this using a combination of my Molding skill and Magic Engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also distributed it to Finne, Iris, Asha, Ephyr, Kusel, and Suzuno.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and his party of four were still stunned, but as if coming back to themselves, they thanked me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyway, thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Tendo, Mogami, Shinonome, and Asakura also thanked me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don&#8217;t sweat it, I just want you guys to be safe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aww, that makes me so happy&#8230;also, please look after Suzuno.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You bet. I&#8217;m not going to do something lame like not being able to protect a woman who loves me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Suzuno’s face turned red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you talking about, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others laughed delightfully when they saw Suzuno smack me on the back for saying so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haha, that kinda makes me feel all tingling inside&#8230;well then, we&#8217;d better get going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s really no helping you, Haruto&#8230;all right. Let’s be on our way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay. Take care.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying that, I fist-pumped Tendo and Mogami and said goodbye to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shinonome and Asakura approached Suzuno and called out to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take care, Suzuno. And take good care of her will you, Yuki?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take care! Look out for her okay, Yuki?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks! Both of you, take care as well!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure&#8230;I will. I’ll be sure to protect her, don’t worry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing my words, Shinonome and Asakura nodded in satisfaction, hugged Suzuno and said goodbye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had prepared magic bags for the group, so all four of them are traveling light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We watched Tendo and the rest of the group of heroes until we could no longer see their backs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing Tendo and the others off, we had lunch and decided to discuss our plans for the day ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, we will be leaving for the Holy State of Belifaire first thing tomorrow. I want us to finish procuring the necessary supplies like food, tools and the likes today. So let&#8217;s split up and go shopping.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebas, Lyla, and Mia responded to these words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Master Haruto. “If it’s shopping, you can leave it to us&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please leave it to us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I appreciate you all saying that, but this is in preparation for our trip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s something one ought to do themselves, not leave to others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me at least prepare for my own trip. But, fine. Can I trouble you to prepare the carriage then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood. We’ll do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I watched Sebas and co. leave after bowing their heads, and then we too headed out to do some shopping.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-71509039' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-71509039' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to buy what I could get at my own store and what I didn&#8217;t have at Bacchus&#8217; place or at a nearby store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we arrived at our store, and told them what we needed, they quickly got everything ready&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I can’t! I can&#8217;t take money from Master Haruto!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why not, I mean&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benak refused to accept payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can&#8217;t just up and take goods for free just because it&#8217;s my trading company. Don&#8217;t you think so too, Bohbee?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Bohbee, who was listening to the conversation next to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re right, boss. Even if you own the store, the goods must be accounted for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you understand now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes sir, I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benak finally agreed and accepted the payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After putting away the purchased supplies in dimensional storage, we left the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We spent half a day shopping, having fun together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, just like that, it was the next day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were back in front of the mansion again after showing up at Dillan’s place to inform him of our departure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eight members going on the trip this time were myself, Finne, Iris, Asha, Kusel, Suzuno, Ephyr, and Zero&#8230;well, nine, including Maguro.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please do take care, Master Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course. I leave the mansion in your capable hands, Sebas.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bohbee and Benak as well, I leave the company in your able hands. Continue expanding the business as much as it requires.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““Yes sir!””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They replied cheerfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And Noir, please look after everyone from the shadows. If anything happens, report to Sebas, Bohbee, Lyla, and Mia immediately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my words, Noir knelt down and nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right then, hop in guys!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that cue, everyone got into the carriage at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay then. Here we go, Maguro!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Neighhhh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maguro, in high spirits started to move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our carriage slowly passed through the north gate as everyone saw us off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From here to the capital of the Holy State of Belifaire is nearly two weeks by carriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within a week, we would be at the border.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until then, everyone would spend their free time however they like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder what kind of place the Holy State of Belifaire is?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was getting excited thinking about finally getting to see this country which I knew nothing about.</span></p>
