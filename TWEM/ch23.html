<h1>Chapter 23: The Promise We Made</h1>

<div class="text-left">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The court magicians group that serves the Royal Palace isn’t actually a department to be exact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their group is mainly responsible for paperwork, or simply desk work.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">And there’s another division – the Forces, they are legitimate armed forces of the kingdom against threats to the peace of the kingdom.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The department is named XXX and the force is named XXX.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">And, even though the Knights are armed soldiers equivalent to the armies of neighboring empires, they are not part of the Forces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both swords and magic belong to those who are above average in ability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are many aristocrats with good family connections in the Knights, but I don’t want to get too close to them. I can go to the captain directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">And I belong to – The Royal Annihilation Force.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve explained it lightly before, but I’m a slightly special case among court magicians.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I was forced to become a court magician through an irregular route. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We, court magicians, manage people who have extraordinary magical powers and are likely to pose a threat to the kingdom.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">This is how the Annihilation Force is formed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">You can think of it as putting mad dogs in an unattended cage. If you can tame a mad dog with unusual methods, it will become a capable and faithful dog. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was recruited by a court magician, I had no idea there was such a back story. I felt like I’m being forcibly taken away rather than scouted. I even broke four bones.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Those who belong to the Annihilation Force, where unusual magic wielders are grouped together, had only one job; if there is a threat against the kingdom or a royal family, risk your life to eliminate it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Restrained with an invisible collar, instead of having the freedom they deserve, they have to die for the country and the royal family in case of an emergency.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the pledge to erase the names from memory, they rely on us in case of an emergency. It’s convenient, but can’t be helped either. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any age, the weak are afraid of the powerful and use their wits to trap them. And in this day and age, the number of the weak is overwhelmingly higher than that of the strong.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">So, the few who have power can only be at the mercy of many who do not.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">◇</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… You know?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I narrowed my eyes a little and forced out a slightly husky voice. Does she know what my job is? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How did she even know the existence of the Annihilation Force? That’s the actual point.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Before, Arina-san told me that the princess should not know about the oath, so I thought she didn’t know the existence of our group.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness nodded in response to my question.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“During one of my strolls in the royal palace, I heard a rumor about court magicians… that’s when I found out.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, where else could she find it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The existence of the Annihilation Force is not concealed. In contrast, it is quite famous for being a completely different department from the others.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">But I thought that the king of this country was afraid of us, and that his biological daughter, Her Highness, was only considerate to us because she did not know.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the time. Let’s open up. I don’t intend to hide it anyway. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“As Your Highness said, I belong to the Royal Annihilation Force. We are magicians who are controlled by the kingdom as a weapon. By the way, how much do you know about us?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I don’t know that much…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It doesn’t matter just to know.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">How much information does Her Highness have? That’s important. I stopped to talk, because now we’re in a dangerous situation where Her Highness was targeted. We must escape to a safe place as soon as possible. I don’t know the enemy troops’ strength.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… A group of people with overwhelming magical powers beyond the reach of other magicians. If all of them fight seriously, it will cause disaster-grade damage, isn’t it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s not exaggerated…I guess it’s pretty much right. I’m not lying that people other than me have overwhelming skills, and if they fight seriously, they can really cause disaster-grade damage. Especially Elto-san and Arina-san’s magic… It’s dangerous.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">At least, I found out that she knew nothing about the oaths that they forced upon us. I don’t want to say her name carelessly again, so I have to make sure of it first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, will you promise me one thing?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Promise…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I smiled at Her Highness.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“From now on… no, at least until we are out of this mess, don’t tell me your name. I can’t go into details, but it’s very important.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? If it’s about my name, Raize-sama, before…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, of course I remember. However, I can’t mention your name in this situation. I can’t let anyone know that you’re here. If they find out, it’ll be quite troublesome.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I bowed my head and lied.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness, of course, will see through my half lie. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness has a possession magic, the Mind’s Eye Apperception. No matter how small a lie is, or how she thinks of the other person, she can see through them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s the only lie I can think of, or an excuse for why I don’t want her to tell me her name now. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">But even if I know I’d be caught, I have to tell her. To protect Her Highness.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“ … ”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness said nothing.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She kept staring at me with a slightly shocked look on her face.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I silently apologized to her in my heart. I’m sorry that I couldn’t remember your name. That’s quite heartbreaking.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few seconds, the princess suddenly sighed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Okay. I won’t say my name until I’m in a safe situation.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you very much.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“But,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She said with a forlorn expression, putting her index finger to my mouth, efficiently blocking my words.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“When this is over, tell me the real reason, will you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You might get hurt… “</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m prepared, if that’s the case. If you hurt someone, you should experience the same pain yourself.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… I promise.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I lowered my head deeply and put my hand on my chest.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the princess is quite passionate.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked to the south of the royal capital and urged toward it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let’s hurry to where the Knights are. I’ll hold you and run…” </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t have to.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked back reflexively at the voice I heard all of a sudden. Then I saw a sharp knife flying at me.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“… huh!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately hugged the princess and dodged. The weapon pierces the stone roof deeply. The sharpness is profound… is magic added?</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked in the direction of the sword’s flight, and saw a tall man with shiny long blonde hair.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">His clothes were similar to the ones worn by Royal Guards, a mixture of red and white uniform. On his chest was a double-sword brooch, insignia of the deputy commander of the Royal Guards.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew he’d come.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“The main performer’s entrance will surely be at the final moments, don’t you agree?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? You’re lying, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness gasped in shock.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of us was the group of vanished royal guards, who I was most wary of. I thought I had seen it coming, but I didn’t know he was aiming for a time like now…</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Arsenas Kroger…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t have to introduce myself? That’s convenient. Long time no see, Your Highness. I’m glad you look well.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The missing Deputy Commander of the Royal Guard – Arsenas Kroger, gave a reverent bow with a fearless smile on his lips… </span></p>
