<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Monster Summoning</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Would you guys mind stepping back for a bit? I&#8217;m about to summon a monster to take Zero&#8217;s place as the boss monster of this place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making sure everyone was far enough away, I held out one hand in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I activated the monster summoning skill, infusing my magic power into it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Get your ass out here already.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chant for the summoning could be anything really, so it’s simple and easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, a huge magic circle about fifty meters in diameter was drawn from magic power on the ground in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I immediately poured the magic power needed for the summoning into it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was told that only a small amount of mana would be needed, so I guess this much should be about right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought to put as little mana as possible, but&#8230;for some reason, Zero was looking kinda pale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My Lord. The magic power is too much. There is a possibility that this will cause the summoning to fail, or that a very powerful monster will come out that could prove uncontrollable&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? Are you serious? I actually thought it was little&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others agreed with Zero&#8217;s words, nodding in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow like, really?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could it be, that my mana capacity has increased as a result of the evolution, and I can’t control it well anymore?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or rather, what happens if the summoning fails?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;The mana in the magic circle will go out of control and explode.&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s going to explode?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;With this amount of mana, Nargadia Labyrinth and its surroundings will be obliterated from the map.&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, no, no, that’s not good! Please tell me that sooner sheesh!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hurriedly tried to reduce my magic power, but the magic circle began to glow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh no, is it going to explode?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;No. It seems the summoning was a success.&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Ellis&#8217; voice, black mana spiraled up from the magic circle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And after the magic subsided, what appeared was&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A black sphere?&#8221;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shinonome muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right, there was a sphere with a radius of about fifty metre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gradually, cracks appeared and the sphere shattered, revealing the figure of a monster inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, no way! How come&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Iris who raised her voice in such despair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others were also breaking out in cold sweats at the sheer amount of magic power being exuded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster that appeared was about fifty meters long. It was a four-legged beast with two horns on its head. It looked like a combination of a cow and a hippopotamus, but its reddish-black skin and bulging muscles stood out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This amount of mana and presence is&#8230;just about the same as Zero uh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Iris, are you okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Iris, who was stunned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like hell I am! This monster is probably the legendary demonic beast——Behemoth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Behemoth?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in my original world, I think I heard the name a lot in games and anime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Iris, the last time it was recorded was in a war a thousand years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cornered by war, a nation summoned Behemoth, a legendary demonic beast that is said to have lived in the age of the gods. However, as soon as Behemoth was summoned, it indiscriminately destroyed not only the enemy nation, but also the nation that summoned it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was thought that Behemoth was going to invade the surrounding nations, but it disappeared before it could do so, partly because it had little magic power at the time of summoning rendering it an incompete summoning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the story has been handed down to the royal families of various countries as a fairy tale to admonish against monster summoning by the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so&#8230;but if this guy goes on a rampage right now, only me or Zero could possibly stop him, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">——GURUOOOOOOHHHH!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I finished saying that, Behemoth roared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tsk, I’ve gone and set off an unnecessary flag* uh? (TLN: Implies the trigger of an event, which almost always result in a negative outcome)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bellowing and the pressure released at the same time caused the pale faces of Tendo, Finne and the others to quickly flee to the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can understand Finne and the others making a break for it, but as a hero, why are you at the top flight, Tendo?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, he&#8217;s probably exhausted from the battle earlier, even though he’s recovered from the potion, so maybe I should cut him some slack, I thought as I checked Behemoth’s status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>&lt;Ruler of Earth&gt;</b></p>
<p><b>Magic consumption is reduced by one-fifth.</b></p>
<p><b>Fire, Lightning, Darkness, and Earth magic are increased six-fold.</b></p>
<p><b>Basic physical ability and magic power in combat are increased five-fold.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm&#8230;if I consider just the skill alone, then he’s probably stronger than Zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was stunned, Behemoth rushed at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, calm down!? I&#8217;m the summoner, okay?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;The monsters you summon must show their abilities and follow you. I also assume that he’s angry because he was disturbed by the summoning after being dormant for so long.&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that why he’s angry and attacking the summoner?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I immediately prepared myself, but Zero leaped over and stood in front of Behemoth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How utterly foolish to stand against your summoner. Behemoth, I will deal with you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Behemoth didn&#8217;t stop. It thrust out its horns and closed in on us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero used earth magic to create a thick wall, but it was easily shattered by the rush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be able to break through that wall so easily&#8230;impressive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was nonchalantly thinking about this, Zero transformed one of his arms to its dragon form and slammed his fist into Behemoth&#8217;s nose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth&#8217;s massive body finally comes to a stop, and his eyes turned to Zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘&#8230;Hmm? Look who it is, there’s no mistaking that magic power, it’s been a while, Kalamiras. But don&#8217;t get in my way. I can&#8217;t forgive him for interrupting my sleep with such a silly trick as summoning.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think he’s getting a little overzealous just because his sleep was disturbed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, they seem to know each other?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I could say anything about it, Zero shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero said, looking at me, and Behemoth turned to look at me as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What’s going on? Why are you protecting this human?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Because he is the Lord who gave me my new name, Zero.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;What the hell?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth looked at me, eyes widened in disbelief at Zero&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘&#8230;Hmph. Kalamiras. So you’ve fallen so far that you now must obey some mere human. Then I shall take it upon myself to liberate you.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s a hell of a way to put it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, you don’t say. Are your brains made of muscles as well if you can&#8217;t even discern what your summoner is capable of?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Keep talking nonsense. You can only talk like that for so long.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth easily fell for my provocation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I reached out to Zero via telepathy. It seemed that telepathic communication was possible now that we were master and servant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘&#8230;Can I butcher this beast?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘&#8230;He&#8217;s one of my oldest friends. I don&#8217;t want you to kill him if you can help it.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I see, then, I’d rather not kill him&#8230;but we still have to put him in his place, don&#8217;t we?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘At your will.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I smiled, having heard Zero&#8217;s request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, as if sensing some kind of presence, I heard Finne and Tendo talking, even though they couldn&#8217;t have seen my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I get the feeling he’s up to something bad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Miss Finne.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo agreed with Finne&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you mean by something bad, sheesh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stand down, Zero.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aye sir.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I confirmed that Zero had fallen back to Finne and the others, I set up a barrier around them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Are you done? Then eat this—Disruption.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth finally opened his mouth after watching the entire scenario leisurely, like someone watching a TV drama in his living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A black ball of lightning was shot out of Behemoth&#8217;s mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s&#8230;a combination of darkness and lightning magic? With that kind of mana density, I should probably handle it with caution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cheeky!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put a barrier on my right hand and struck the black lightning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And at the moment of impact, I activated my time-space magic and transported it to another space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I were to tackle it head-on carelessly, the lightning would likely spread throughout this entire floor, and canceling it out with a magic spell containing an equal amount of mana would also risk an outburst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes a considerable amount of mana to use space-time magic to transfer to another space, but I don&#8217;t have to worry about it getting out of control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It disappeared?! No friggin’ way!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in Behemoth&#8217;s eyes, it seemed to have simply disappeared just like he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Iris saw that he had stopped moving in surprise, she squealed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I should have known! There&#8217;s no way in hell Haruto would lose!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Umm, my dear Iris, you should know that’s a typical flag you’re setting up right there!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps thinking the same thing, Tendo and the others also seemed to be dripping with cold sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Umm, Iris. I don&#8217;t think you should say anything about that yet&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What, why?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Iris tilted her head at Suzuno&#8217;s words, Behemoth, who seemed to have regained its composure, let out a low voice that seemed to resonate from the bottom of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘&#8230;It would seem that you’re a bit capable, but don’t go counting your eggs just yet! Goddamn human!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With those words, mana erupted from Behemoth&#8217;s entire body.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-43414392' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-43414392' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It then clung to the Behemoth&#8217;s body and became a reddish-black armor made entirely of magic power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pressure directed at me was now stronger than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;Master, Behemoth&#8217;s stats has more than doubled.&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So it would seem. Such a pain in the ass.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has physical resistance and magic resistance skills, so any half-hearted attack won&#8217;t do any damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, my magic power has been reduced to a certain extent during the summoning process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Even with that, he’s still no match for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I muttered to myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if he heard my voice, Behemoth rushed at me with even greater speed than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was moving at almost the speed of sound, but it still seemed like slow motion to me, given my physical abilities and thought speed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth’s horns were filled with immense amount of magic power, and there is no doubt that a mere graze on it would send me flying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8230;Well, that would be if I were only a human.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shifted my body and stood so that I was exactly in between the left and right horns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I put my right hand on Behemoth&#8217;s forehead and killed the momentum of its full-throttle lunge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pushed back a few meters, but that was about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Those are quite some dangerous-looking horns, may I break ‘em?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, glancing at the horns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘&#8230;A mere human thinks he can stop my thrust.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When did I say I was a human?&#8221;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘&#8230;What? What do you mean?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just evolved a few minutes ago.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Evolved? I can understand if it were an elf, but a human evolving is just&#8230;’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, what can I say.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth glared at me and retreated with a swift movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘&#8230;I see. Judging by the abilities you’ve displayed, it seems to be true that you have evolved&#8230;but that doesn’t change anything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment he finished saying that, a reddish-black lightning bolt fell directly from above and struck me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the same as the black lightning ball from earlier&#8230;no, It&#8217;s a lightning magic that contained even more magic power than that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘You shall perish along with your soul! I acknowledge your strength, mighty human!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cloud of dust rose up around where I was standing, and the ground several meters around me was scorching hot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard the shouts of Finne, Iris, and Suzuno.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now, there should be nothing left of&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How could you be so naive. Are you really a legendary demonic beast?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What the—?!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said provocatively and used wind magic to clear away the smoke, revealing a perfectly healthy figure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘No friggin’ way! My lightning is one that annihilates everything. I infused so much mana into it that not even a corpse would be left behind, much less an extinguished charcoal! So how are you still alive&#8230;?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Simply put, that level of attack don’t work on me, nothing more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Doesn’t work on you? That&#8217;s impossible!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, are you blind or what? In fact, here I am in one piece.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a simple matter of putting up a barrier to protect myself, but Behemoth evidently seemed reluctant to acknowledge reality, he probably can’t even imagine there being such a powerful barrier capable of preventing against that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I don&#8217;t have to explain that much to him anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well then&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I drew out my blade to fight back, magic power flooded Behemoth&#8217;s body again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Don’t tell me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As was the case with Zero, the mana turned into a sphere that covered Behemoth’s entire body, and then shrank to the size of a human.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sphere cracked open and out of it emerged a muscular and handsome man, less than two meters tall. He had short black hair and looked to be in his thirties or so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had horns on his head, the same shape as when he was a beast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, you’re in a better position to fight, right? We&#8217;re finally on equal footing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, it&#8217;s just that you&#8217;ve been attacking me unilaterally up to this point, and it hasn&#8217;t been working. Why are you acting like you’re doing it out of consideration for me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What nonsense are you saying—you&#8217;re below me, while I&#8217;m above you, you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What did you just say?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth&#8217;s face twisted in anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the same with Zero, but after transforming into his humanoid form, it&#8217;s become easy to see his expression and it&#8217;s worth the agitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound of Asha and the others talking reached my ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He seems like some villain straight out of a comic book doesn’t he&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yuki seems to be in a good mood if he’s saying all that.&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-67063361' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-67063361' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPScyJyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8aW5zIGNsYXNzPSJhZHNieWdvb2dsZSIKICAgICBzdHlsZT0iZGlzcGxheTpibG9jazsgdGV4dC1hbGlnbjpjZW50ZXI7IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtbGF5b3V0PSJpbi1hcnRpY2xlIgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtZm9ybWF0PSJmbHVpZCIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWNsaWVudD0iY2EtcHViLTY2MDk0NDIzMzgwODAxMTYiCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1zbG90PSI0NjU2ODgwMzY4Ij48L2lucz4KPHNjcmlwdD4KICAgICAoYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgPSB3aW5kb3cuYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgfHwgW10pLnB1c2goe30pOwo8L3NjcmlwdD4=' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, since he seems to be having fun, it’s all good right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha, Mogami, and Kusel were the ones having such conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;I will come settle accounts with you guys later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was lightly directing intimidation carrying my protest in their direction, and before I knew it, Behemoth in front of me was holding up his fist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you regret it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Regret? I don&#8217;t remember saying anything that I regret&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Fine, there will be no need for regrets when you’re dead anyway!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the blink of an eye, Behemoth was closing in on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could see the lightning and darkness magic clinging to his fists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like all the magic he had used so far, it seems like a bad idea to touch it with my bare hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth shot out his fists at me with considerable speed, but I used my barrier and harden skill in tandem to repel them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the side, it may look like Behemoth is overwhelming me with his attacks, but I haven&#8217;t moved a foot and I still have plenty of leeway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you massaging me or what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrr.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grabbed Behemoth by the wrist and slammed him into the ground with a backhanded throw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ground cracked radially, and blood leaked from Behemoth&#8217;s mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He must have suffered considerable damage, but Behemoth quickly got up and moved away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, probably realizing that he couldn&#8217;t win with his fists, he distorted the space in front of him and plunged his arm into it, pulling out a battle axe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it didn&#8217;t seem to have any special abilities like my Black Katana Benizakura, it seemed to contain a lot of mana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth waved his axe a few times as if to check its grip, and then came running toward me again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps because he was using a weapon that was familiar to his hands, his movements seemed lighter than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I narrowly avoided the attack from his weapon that was faster than I had expected—but the next moment, my cheek was ripped open and a stream of blood flowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm? I avoided the attack completely just now, didn&#8217;t I?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;Yes. It appeared that when he swung the axe, there was some kind of faint whirling around the blade.&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was wondering, Ellis answered me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, so it&#8217;s better not to dodge too close to the edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pulled out my favorite blade and ran magic power through it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I caught the axe that was swung from above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth threw his weight at me, probably thinking that he could overwhelm me with strength due to our size difference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, both our strength alone seemed to be evenly matched, and no matter how much effort he put into it, my blade did not even twitch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you only know how to fight with brute force?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What, nonsense? In that case, let me show you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I provoked him in exasperation, Behemoth distanced himself from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, wondering why his was channeling mana into his legs and axe—his figure disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even my eyesight couldn’t keep up with him?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a frontal attack, then&#8230;from the back!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly turned around and caught the downward swung axe with my blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was able to parry the impact, but was knocked off my stance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deciding that it would be a bad idea to give him an opportunity to use magic in this situation, I dodged the axe once and backed away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I did, Behemoth&#8217;s axe swung after me and hit me directly.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—He disappeared?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, my figure simply vanished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, that figure was created using Heat Haze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth looked surprised, but it was only for a moment, and he immediately held up his axe to guard against his surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Would you look at that, you can actually do it if you tried.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? When did you—Ugh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I kicked Behemoth in the back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth was blown away, but he regained his stance in the air and slid along the ground with his hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when he came to a complete stop, I quickly moved in front of Behemoth and kicked his jaw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ghah!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh blood flew from his mouth, and Behemoth collapsed onto his back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used my Molding skill to create a chain that bound Behemoth to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s see&#8230;in order to subdue a rebellious prick by making him understand the undeniable difference in power, a little theatrics is imperative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I molded a throne-like chair in front of Behemoth who was wriggling like a worm, and sat down on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth looked up at me venomously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, his hostility is still as strong as ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I invoked intimidation and flooded my entire body with crimson mana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A-Are you telling me, you still possess this much magic power&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth, apparently finally realizing the difference in power, muttered helplessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then spoke out indifferently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yield or suffer eternal torment. Your choice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Ugh, I see. I finally understand why Kalamiras is under your command.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero didn’t utter anything. He was just watching how things unfold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Behemoth, choose. Don&#8217;t make me repeat myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth bowed his head at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“P-Please take me under your command. If possible, I would like you bestow me a new name.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Sure, I hope we get on well from now on!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so the contract with Behemoth was concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing as Behemoth has joined ranks, I quickly removed his chains and cast a recovery spell on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behemoth, however, was dumbfounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;re under my wing now, so it wouldn&#8217;t be strange if I healed you. What? You didn&#8217;t want me to heal you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, no. Nothing of the sort.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I informed Behemoth, who got up and dropped to his knees in fear, his new name and the purpose for which I summoned him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Behemoth. First, let me bestow unto you a new name&#8230;your new name shall be Glatnis, the Earth Raging Beast, Glatnis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am humbled. I, Glatnis, pledge my lifelong loyalty to you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, I&#8217;ll be counting on you. And as for why I summoned you&#8230;is because I want you to be the boss of this dungeon and manage it for me. You should be able to communicate with me via telepathy, or can you not?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I can. So, you want me to take over the management of this dungeon right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-77135885' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-77135885' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Zero, I can give him boss privileges by manipulating the dungeon core settings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I&#8217;m thinking of making this guy the boss monster&#8230;seems a bit overpowered, no?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I’m going through all this trouble, it would be nice if I could manipulate the dungeon itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;It&#8217;s possible if you use the Dungeon Core. It would require a huge amount of magic power, but it shouldn’t be a problem for Master or Glatnis whatsoever.&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was feeling troubled, Ellis answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seriously!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well then, since I&#8217;m here, I guess I&#8217;ll just try some things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s see&#8230;apparently, you’re also capable of manipulating this dungeon with your mana, so I would like to increase the number of floors altogether. Well, I&#8217;ll leave the details to you&#8230;but I’m thinking perhaps we leave the thirty floors as is, and create new floors underground, what do you think?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I&#8217;ll just dump the nitty-gritty of it on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess I&#8217;ll just have to come back one of these days to see how it turned out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now then, let&#8217;s get back to the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I kept you guys waiting, my bad.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m glad you were able to get him under your command.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded at Finne’s words and looked at Glatnis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me introduce him again. This is Glatnis, my new subordinate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m Glatnis. Nice to meet you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone greeted him after the other, although they were all a little afraid to do so because they had seen the battle earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right then, Zero. Could you lead me and Glatnis to the dungeon core?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I quickly registered him as an administrator in the dungeon core.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now Glatnis can freely manipulate the dungeon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I returned to the others and called out to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right guys, let&#8217;s head back!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I&#8217;ll just go back to Perdis and relax for the time being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was just thinking about that when I realized something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh right, I need to inform the other heroes of some things as well&#8230;umm, how about, I tell them that there is no boss monster on the 30th floor, so they should return to Glicente once they&#8217;ve conquered the 29th floor&#8230;that leaves you guys, Tendo, what’s your plan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, there&#8217;s nothing to do if we go back to Glicente anyway, and it’s much more likely for us to increase our levels if we stayed with you, Haruto, so do you mind if we tag along?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure, I don&#8217;t mind. Then, I&#8217;ll just quickly go and meet the others and pass the info along, so you guys wait here for a bit!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, and went around to my classmates inside the dungeon to pass along the message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The function of God Eye is still intact, so it&#8217;s nice to know who&#8217;s where at times like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I finished my errand in a flash and went back to the 30th floor to meet up with everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sorry for the wait guys, I&#8217;ll now transfer everybody to the entrance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone who had been resting in their own way gathered around me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;See you later, Glatnis. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how the labyrinth turns out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Leave it to me, sir.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded to Glatnis, who bowed, and activated the teleportation.</span></p>
