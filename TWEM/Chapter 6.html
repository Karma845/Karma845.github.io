<b>Chapter 6 &#8211; A Subjugation Quest With The Entire Party!</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, we were all strolling aimlessly around the holy city. We were done with most of the sightseeing, but we decided to take it easy since we might find ourselves with a lot of time on our hands if we headed straight for the empire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, each of them was wearing the jewelry I had given them, with a relaxed expression on their faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s kinda embarrassing seeing them so happy with my gift. Although I didn’t show it, obviously&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where are we going today, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr asked me as we were walking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I haven&#8217;t really thought about it. Does anyone have any suggestions?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If no one has any suggestions, we can just go to the cathedral instead. The place is simply breathtaking that I never get tired of seeing it no matter how many times I go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While everyone was busy trying to come up with something, Iris raised her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would like to go to the guild!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right, I did promise to take them yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If everyone else is cool with it, we could just take on some random quest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t expect to take on commissions two days in a row after coming to the holy city, but it’s kinda nice to take on a quest in a different place with a new flavor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Should we make it a simple quest that could be completed in half a day?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s fine!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that all right with you guys?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one seemed to have any objection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then let&#8217;s do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">〜</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No way the same drama as yesterday would occur again today. There was a moment when I thought so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when we entered the guild building&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, baldie! You just knocked down my sword!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You talkin’ to me?  This is shaved, it’s fashionable!! Besides, I don&#8217;t want to hear that shit from a punk with such a weird hairstyle, only a dumbass would put something like that on their head!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fuck did you just say?! This is what you call fashion! Don’t you dare compare me with a shit-for-brains fucker like you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two adventurers were clutching each other&#8217;s chests and cursing at each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, I&#8217;m relieved to see that the adventurers&#8217; guilds are the same no matter the place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We entered the guild in a large group, but no one wanted to get involved, except for a few fleeting glances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it might be a little weird for me to say, but we&#8217;re a pretty strange bunch. I guess they’re just letting sleeping dogs lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After waiting in line at the reception, it was our turn. The receptionist seemed to be a different person from yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was a little surprised, perhaps because of the large number of people waiting in line, but she immediately put on a business smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Could you see if you can find us a simple quest that will take about half a day to complete.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood.  Your card please, if you will.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the instructions of the receptionist, each of us submitted our card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Eh?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s pretty much the same reaction as yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don&#8217;t worry about the difficulty of the quest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I understand! Please wait a moment!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She became nervous all of a sudden, if only they didn&#8217;t get nervous like that each and every time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a few moments, the receptionist, who seemed to have found a quest, proceeded to explain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How about extermination of a goblin nest? There are over a hundred of them, and we have confirmed the presence of several goblin generals and a king.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t mind, but why hasn’t anyone picked it yet?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist answered my question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Actually, this nest has only recently been identified. However, we haven&#8217;t been able to find adventurers who could take down the horde right away, including the king&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way of saying——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just in time for an EX rank adventurer to clean up the mess, correct?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-Not at all!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris asked the receptionist, who was shaking her head in panic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Any casualties as of yet?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No. Not that we know of.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be best to get this done before there are any casualties.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can’t the knights just take care of it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist gave a reply to my reasonable question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not really, this kind of request is basically handled by the Adventurers&#8217; Guild. If there was no one to accept it after waiting for a while, we would have asked the Knights to take it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. Oh well, we&#8217;ll take care of it before they cause any real damage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you very much. Then I will begin the paperwork.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After completing the procedures, we left the guild and headed for our destination, a forest on the outskirts of the holy city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">〜</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, the cleanup of the goblin nest was completed in less than an hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quest was quite simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All we had to do was launch some fireballs into the cave where the nest was located.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Towards the end, the goblin king and three goblin generals appeared from within the cave, only to be instantly killed by Finne, Iris, Asha, Ephyr, Suzuno, and Kusel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;It was a complete overkill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s so boring.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And everyone else seemed to feel the same way, so we decided to go for a walk in the forest after collecting the parts to be used as quest completion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I called it going for a walk, I was using Map together with my skills to look for strong monsters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we went deeper into the forest, there was a reaction of a strong monster on the map.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero seemed to sense it, too, and turned to me and asked, “What shall we do?”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then appraised the monster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elder Treant. A tree monster that has lived for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is my first time seeing one in person, but from what I&#8217;ve heard, treants attack mainly by moving vines and roots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told everyone about the presence of the elder treant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An elder treant? That&#8217;s an A-rank monster!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, so an elder treant is classified as A-rank, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems to live deep in the forest, so it must have remained undetected for many years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If left unchecked, it could spell a disaster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, any takers? And by the way, it looks like it has [magic resistance] skill, so do be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked around after saying that, and found Finne, Iris, Asha, and Kusel raising their hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if they’re up to the task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was wondering that, Ellis explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;If all four of them work together, they should be able to defeat it in no time at all.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What? The opponent is an A-rank, right? It should be of the same rank as the ogre king.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Although it&#8217;s an A-rank, it belongs in the lower end, moreover, there’s also a factor of their compatibility.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm, that&#8217;s all right then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, if the four of you face it together, the elder treant will perish in no time, so I’m thinking of sending only one of you, what do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh, wait, are you being serious? An elder treant is an A-rank monster, correct&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne asked again as if to confirm, and I nodded, “yeah”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affirming this, Finne muttered, “I guess, I have become that strong&#8230;”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, compared to when we first met, Finne has definitely become much stronger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four of them then began to discuss the matter, but none of them backed down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stand down, Asha!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s so cruel! Trying to keep the fun to yourself! I’d like to give it a shot too?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrrr!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why don’t you stand down then, Iris?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris and Asha were arguing, when Finne butted in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What about you, Finne, why not sit this one out?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if I do, good luck convincing Kusel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, I’ll have you know I’m already raring to go!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four of them were staring at each other with sparks flying between them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Ephyr and Suzuno looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah I know. This should do the trick.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s that&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuno muttered and tilted her head, and Ephyr standing next to her was wondering the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four, who had been glaring at each other while this was going on finally turned to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““““We’ll let Haruto decide!””””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I quickly held out the other end of the four sticks——I was preparing earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is this, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of these four sticks has a red tip. So how about, whoever chooses it gets to fight the elder treant?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh I see.  This certainly seems fair.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne agreed to my proposal, followed by Iris, Asha, and Kusel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure why Suzuno is looking at me as if wondering why I had such a thing readily with me, but even I didn&#8217;t think it would ever come in handy one day either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne and the other three grabbed one each and pulled it out at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the winner——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That would be me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stick with a red mark on it was raised up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris won the right to challenge the elder treant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of level, the elder treant was much stronger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when combined with the performance of her weapons and physical abilities, it’s safe to say that Iris has the upper hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we quickly moved to the location of the elder treant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, having drawn her lightning-attribute magic sword Tonitrus and wind-attribute magic sword Tempest, stepped forward and took a stance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the rest of us were spectating from a distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elder treant whipped countless tree branches at Iris who appeared in front of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Too slow!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris avoided every one of the elder treant’s attacks and approached it. Her path after she moved was filled with lightning trails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, who had entered within fatal range of the elder treant, swung her lightning-clad magic sword, Tonitrus, at the trunk of its main body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But just as the sword was about to reach the trunk, a root appeared like a thorn from the ground at Iris&#8217;s feet and attacked to skewer her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wha—?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprised by the sudden attack, Iris, who had evaded by twisting herself, leapt backward, slashing away at the roots with her magic sword, Tempest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She regained her breath and readied both swords again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How about this then——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris increased her speed even more and approached the elder treant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elder treant conjured a wall of wood from the ground, but it was too slow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris cut it down with her magic sword Tempest, then climbed over the collapsed wall and slashed at the trunk with her sword Tonitrus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lightning-imbued slash cut deep into the trunk of the elder treant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, as if writhing in pain, countless branches attacked Iris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh dammit!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris complained as she thwarted the attack, but the branches quickly regenerated and attacked again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s no end to these things!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elder treant’s self-regeneration skill had regenerated the branches from where they had been cut off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an extremely troublesome skill that would have allowed the attack to go on indefinitely unless it was destroyed altogether with a high sufficient firepower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Kusel called out to her, getting excited for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Looks like you’re struggling, need help?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at her, I bet she just wants to let loose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No thanks!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as Iris answered, lightning surged out from her body, and the winds around her rose up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll wrap it up with this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, looking at the elder treant——dashed forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris approached the elder treant again at lightning speed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slash wound she inflicted on the main body earlier had been regenerated with its self-regeneration skill, but she swung her magic sword regardless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just need not give you the chance to even regenerate!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an instant, the trunk of the tree was scarred, and the branches that had come close to prevent it were sliced into pieces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, a storm blew up with the magic sword Tempest, which lifted the elder treant up to its roots and blew it away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, lightning started crackling around the magic sword, Tonitrus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unable to do anything in mid-air, the elder treant fell to the ground in a heap. Aiming at it, Iris made a single swing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a single strike as if lightning had fallen from the sky, the elder treant was obliterated. Yeah, it was literally annihilated by a lightning strike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris had successfully defeated the elder treant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There would be no problem with the part proving its subjugation, as a severed branch would suffice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne, Kusel, and Asha, who didn’t get a chance to fight, were happy about Iris’ victory and also disappointed at the same time, but on our way back, a few other A-rank monsters appeared, and they were more than happy to get a chance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we returned to the holy city in the early afternoon, and the Adventurers&#8217; Guild was in an uproar when we submitted our proof of subjugation of the elder treant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist, especially, who received the subjugation proof, widened her eyes like they were going to fall off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How did a quest to clean out a goblin nest turn into a subjugation of an elder treant and other A-rank monsters?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nah, as it turns out, we were able to take out the goblin nest pretty easily, and then suddenly had all this free time on our hands to wander around, and so we came across some fairly decent games that seemed like they could serve as targets to measure my party members’ abilities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist didn&#8217;t seem to understand what I was going on about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She froze for a moment, but after a while she came to her senses and asked me a question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um, what do you mean by &#8216;everyone’?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shook my head at her misunderstanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m talking about these four.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned to Finne, Iris, Asha, and Kusel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel is originally an A-ranker, so it’s still within expectations, but as for the other three, they are still far from being high-ranking adventurers, so it seemed a little strange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It certainly does seem plausible with Kusel, but&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can assure you, the other three are also on par with A-rank adventurers. In fact, I think they could win in a one-on-one match.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist looked more and more incredulous, but then seemed convinced and said she would pass it along to the guildmaster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having spent the morning away, and had no other business in the afternoon, we decided to continue taking on quests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the evening, we returned to the guild after completing several subjugation quests and defeating some A-rank monsters we happened to encounter on the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist was like, “Another A-rank monster&#8230;” with a faraway look, but we got the reward and headed back to the inn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whew, I worked up a good sweat today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right?&nbsp; For some reason it felt like the first time we had taken a quest in a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was a little boring for me though, since I didn’t really get a chance to let loose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, Finne, and Kusel were the ones who said that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh come on now. Let&#8217;s just go back to the inn and fill our stomachs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m starving.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone nodded in agreement with Ephyr’s statement, and we hurried back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇ ◇ ◇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the time when Haruto and the others returned to the inn, Ilmina was praying in the cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;na, lady Ilmina.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was concentrating on her prayers when suddenly a voice called out to her</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interrupting her prayer, Ilmina turned around and saw a familiar face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Cardinal Alben? What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would like to talk to you about that matter. We have new information.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing those words, Ilmina’s expression tightened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t know who might be listening in here. Let&#8217;s talk in private.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I agree. We should change location.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nodding to Alben’s suggestion, Ilmina followed him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Let’s use this room.&nbsp; I will bring His Holiness Pope Liebert with me, so please wait a moment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardinal Alben bowed and left the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While waiting for Liebert, Illumina wondered what Alben&#8217;s report was about and how she could limit any further casualties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then she suddenly noticed something unusual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——?! A barrier?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, a barrier was set up around the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, she realized that she couldn&#8217;t call for help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The barrier had a soundproofing effect and also a restriction that prevented anyone within from going out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why would a barrier, which could only be activated by more than one person, be erected inside the cathedral, and in a room she’s currently inside no less?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illumina&#8217;s thoughts were interrupted as she pondered this question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who’s there?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of black scruffy figures appeared from the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina immediately intuited that this group was the organization involved in the missing person&#8217;s case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Ilmina’s intuition was correct, and it wasn’t a bad decision for her to invoke light magic to protect herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she was one step too late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s going on&#8230;? I suddenly, feel, drowsy——&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilmina was afflicted by intense drowsiness and lost consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for this was due to the spraying of an odorless and tasteless sleeping gas. The black scruffy figures had made their move before revealing themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Target secured. We’re pulling out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as one of them said that, the group of black scruffy figures released the barrier and disappeared from the scene with Ilmina in their arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short time later, Liebert, who had been brought to the room by Alben, noticed the situation and the cathedral was in an uproar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The windows were wide open, and Liebert judged that Ilmina had been kidnapped by the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was immediately conveyed to the knights, and a search for Ilmina was quickly mounted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How did this happen&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert lamented as he sat down helplessly on a chair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please, Ilmina, be safe&#8230;oh god, please protect her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben called out to Liebert, who was praying for the safety of his beloved daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is all my fault&#8230;I should have had a knight stay with her&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, this isn’t your fault, Cardinal Alben. It is the ones who kidnapped Ilmina.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am so sorry&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alben bowed his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will join in the search.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Thank you, Cardinal Alben.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure. We will definitely find her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Alben left the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert, who remained alone, was mulling over the seriousness of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knights had already mobilized, and the situation had become too big to impose a gag order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert desperately wondered how he could rescue Ilmina and the other people who had been kidnapped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, he remembered what Ilmina had told him about a certain individual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the said individual is——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;That’s right, If it’s the EX-rank adventurer, Master Haruto, then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An EX-rank adventurer, the strongest adventurer in the world. And he’s currently here in the holy city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And since he’s also Princess Iris&#8217; fiance, he would be more inclined to lend his assistance!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking so, Liebert decided to take action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had no idea what kind of reward the adventurer would demand, but this time around, he couldn’t help but rely on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liebert picked up his pen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like to request an emergency designated commission to Adventurer Haruto for the rescue of Ilmina and the others who have gone missing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After sealing the paper and ringing the bell, a nearby sister came and attended to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Holiness, you called?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please give this to the guildmaster of the Adventurers&#8217; Guild as soon as possible. It’s a designated commission. Once he arrives at the cathedral, bring him to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Certainly, Your Holiness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sister, realizing from Liebert&#8217;s tone that it was urgent, rushed to the Adventurers&#8217; Guild.</span></p>
