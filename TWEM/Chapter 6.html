<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Sometimes we would pass people who wore luxurious clothes. Perhaps they were aristocrats? From what I heard, this kingdom seemed to adopt a feudal hierarchy. But since I was the protagonist, it was possible that I might get involved with them.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>I headed to my destination while walking with swagger. There were a few weeds and three trees along the way to the headquarters, but that was all there was.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It seemed I was the first to arrive. Ah, perhaps it was a good idea to be late for once. To arrive late did feel like a protagonist’s thing after all.　</p>
<p>No, to come late to the meeting place… I don’t think that would have been a good thing to do. Just as I was worried about how I should arrive at my destination as a protagonist, someone came up to me. <span id="easy-footnote-1-20016" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-20016" title="T/N: in case you forgot, despite his crazy and constant suggestion that he is a protagonist, he is still a good person at his core.

<p>　</p>
<p>“Ah, Fay.”　</p>
<p>“…Arthur, huh.”</p>
<p>“So you’re the first to arrive.”</p>
<p>“Aah.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Arthur arrived. After that, Tlue and another two women also arrived.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">◆◆</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>When Arthur arrived at the venue where she would do her first mission in temporary enrollment, she noticed somebody had already arrived before her. The boy had rested his back on one of the three trees, crossed his arms, and closed his eyes. </p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Ah, Fay.”　</p>
<p>“…Arthur, huh.”</p>
<p>“So you’re the first to arrive.”</p>
<p>“Aah.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Silence. Both of them weren’t very talkative anyway; it was natural for this to happen.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>…I wonder how old is Fay? Although anyone could be a paladin once they reached fifteen years old, I was already seventeen years old after all.</em>　</p>
<p>“Fay, how old are you?”　</p>
<p>“…Fifteen.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>
<p><em>Since he seems mature, I thought he was older than that.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Arthur wondered what she could say about that. However, because she tended to choose the wrong words to use, what she said wasn&#8217;t necessarily as she intended to others.</p>
<p>“Fay sure is old in a good way.”　</p>
<p>“…I wonder about that.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>That certainly sounded like an insult, but Arthur was just an airhead. Fay inwardly felt the sarcasm in her words.　</p>
<p><em>As for me… I feel like a kid compared to Fay.</em>　</p>
<p>“Although I’m seventeen, I still look young compared to Fay.”　</p>
<p>“…I guess so.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Fay murmured curtly. Although Arthur didn’t notice, there were creases between Fay’s eyebrows.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>As time went on, another person came into the space between the two.　</p>
<p>“Aah?! How can that be? I thought I was the first to arrive!”　</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Red hair that extended to the waist, and a pair of red eyes which reminded one of a red lotus. She had sharp <em>yaeba</em> teeth and looked like the physical embodiment of the word “Freedom”. She approached while looking at the pair. <span id="easy-footnote-2-20016" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-20016" title="T/N: Tbh, I have no idea who this refers to.

<p>“Ah! You are that person from the exam!”　</p>
<p>“…Who are you?”</p>
<p>“Bouran! That’s my name, remember that, you mook!” <span id="easy-footnote-3-20016" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-20016" title="T/N: Bouran is both anagram of ranbou, which means rough and a certain species of orchid, which represented her childishness."><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Fay just let the words flow out coolly. Bouran was the girl in the novel game Round Table Heroes who was active as a part of the special unit, together with Arthur and Tlue. Her rough tone was conspicuous, but since the game was an utsu novel game, she was also a girl who eventually met her death early.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Awawawa! I’m sorry! Did I arrive extremely late?!”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Right after Bouran arrived, there was a figure who was smaller than Arthur, yet more well-endowed as a woman, with silver hair and blue eyes. It was another girl who appeared.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry… even though I’m an instructor, I ended up late like this…”　</p>
<p>“You’re not late…”</p>
<p>Arthur gave such follow up to the pale girl who introduced herself as an instructor.</p>
<p>“I-I’m glad.”</p>
<p>“But Fay and I have been waiting for quite a while now.”</p>
<p>“Wawawa, I-I’m so sorry!!”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to apologize for that.”</p><div class="watas-87df5ef379b9d2ba7d5f244abb5d15aa watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-87df5ef379b9d2ba7d5f244abb5d15aa"></div>
<p>Arthur meant to tell her the situation to calm the girl down, but on the contrary, it made her even more panicked. Bouran then asked the girl.　</p>
<p>“Instructor?! A chibi like you?!”　</p>
<p>“Ahaha… I’m sorry for being a chibi. Err, Bouran-san, Arthur-san, and Fay-kun, was it? There’s also Tlue-kun… but he seems to have not arrived yet.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Everyone was rather surprised by the fact that the girl was their instructor. After all, she felt young, so much so that she fit more as a student rather than an instructor.　</p>
<p>“Ah, someone’s coming.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Bouran turned her eyes to face where Tlue had arrived at the foot of the three trees in a hurried manner.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry for being late.”　</p>
<p>“No, no, I&#8217;ve just arrived here myself!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>There were now five people in that place where there should only be four of them, with the irregular known as Fay mixed in there, the supposed plot has greatly twisted.　</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>“Let’s introduce ourselves! I am Yururu Garethia, a twelfth-grade paladin who will be serving as your instructor! Nice to meet you!” <span id="easy-footnote-1-20022" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-20022" title="T/N: Does Yururu sound feminine enough? If not, please give me your suggestion later. Also, Garethia refers to Gareth of Round Table."><sup>1</sup></a></span> 　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The first character who would meet her terrible end in the utsu novel game Round Table Heroes, Yururu Garethia, gave her greetings.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Everyone began to introduce themselves as she instructed, giving their respective introductions to both people they knew and people they were meeting for the first time. Then, after chatting to some extent, Yururu immediately took out a white crystal the size of one’s palm.　</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>“We’ll begin our training right away. The detailed lesson about being a paladin will be carried out during our next meeting. Even though you’re all still in your temporary enrollments, you have chosen the path to be active as a paladin. I think that decision requires a certain resolve to take.”　</p>
<p>Unlike the fluffy feeling she gave off as a yuru-character earlier, Yururu had said that in a dignified manner. <span id="easy-footnote-2-20022" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-20022" title="T/N: yuru-character: a loose, fluffy character that is usually used as mascot. Not translated on purpose due to rhyme with her name."><sup>2</sup></a></span>　</p>
<p>“There are also other people who will serve as your instructors but anyway, I’m here to teach you about swordsmanship!”　</p>
<p><em>Motivation, motivation! S</em>uch a feeling exuded out of her.　</p>
<p>“That’s what I’d like to say, but…”　</p>
<p>Her excited expression turned slightly indescribable. A bitter smile leaked out and the cheery yet strict atmosphere dispersed.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“This is the crystal used to measure your magical attribute.&nbsp; Although I’m not the instructor responsible for the magic curriculum… Well, the magic teacher requested me to measure it in advance, so here I am!”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She passed the crystal to Bouran in an animated manner.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Please put the crystal in your palm and imbue it with your<em> art!”　</em></p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“The elemental magics consist of fire, water, earth, wind, and the non-elementals that everybody has. The crystal will produce a bright light associated with the element that you have. Well, most people have a non-elemental and another random element of the four elements though.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Yururu gave a brief explanation. A supernatural phenomenon known as magic was a thing that anyone who became a paladin would definitely learn. For people who already knew it or were in the process of learning, they would learn it again from the basics.　</p>
<p>Magic allows its user to conjure phenomena like pulling fire or water out of nothing, or wind in an enclosed space. However, it wouldn’t allow its user to do everything without limit.　</p>
<p>There was a thing called magic attribute and people could only use magic with the attributes they have. A person needed a fire attribute to cast fire magic, a water attribute to cast water magic, and so on.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“…Well, I already know my own attributes though. I’ll just show you this time.”　</p>
<p>Bouran put the crystal in her palm and blinding light shone. The light associated with fire, water, and earth appeared.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Eeeehh?! No way, a Fourth (three elemental + one non-elemental attribute possessor)?! That’s amazing!”　</p>
<p>“Of course. I’m a genius after all!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She revealed a smug smile as she returned the crystal. Arthur, Tlue, and Fay looked at each other as if questioning who would go next.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“—I don’t mind being last. Go ahead.”　</p>
<p>Fay suddenly muttered so<em>. In that case</em>, thought Tlue as he took the crystal. Then as he imbued the crystal with his power, it revealed a light, much greater than Bouran’s, which shone with the hues associated with fire, water, wind, and earth.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“An All Master (All elemental attribute possessor)?! Eeeeehhh?!”　</p>
<p>“Next is my turn…”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Leaving the surprised Yururu aside, Arthur took the crystal and pushed her power into it like what the others did before. Then… it revealed a totally different type of light. It was both brilliant and ferocious, a star-like light.　</p>
<p>This light fit none of the elements that Yururu said earlier.　</p>
<p>“…An Origin (Unique elemental attribute possessor). Awawawa, what kind of children am I responsible for?!”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Yururu couldn’t hide her surprise. Normally there were only five basic elements in<em> art</em>, which meant that everyone basically had a non-elemental plus any combination of fire, water, earth, and wind.　</p>
<p>Most people would only have a non-elemental plus one other element. In rare cases, there might be people who had two and three extra elements, like Bouran(Fourth) and Tlue(All Master) respectively.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>That was already beyond Yururu&#8217;s expectation. However, next came Arthur, who was an Origin. Origins possessed elements outside the basic elements, and only few of such people existed around the world. It was normal for Yururu to be surprised like this.　</p>
<p>She felt inferior because she… only possessed non-elemental attributes and she was always ridiculed for it. In her case, there were also other circumstances that overlapped with her condition, which also contributed to her ridicule.　</p>
<p><em>Don’t tell me, perhaps the last person too</em>… thought Yururu as she looked at Fay. Fay accepted the crystal from Arthur.　</p>
<p>The situation made Yururu swallow her saliva.　</p>
<p>And…　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">■◆</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Yururu-sensei, the yuru-character sensei, was what I called her in my mind. As I listened to her, an interesting event happened. It was an attribute test by use of crystal.　</p>
<p>Fufufuh, so this event finally came. It was an event to show my hidden potential! Ah- I wasn’t able to measure my own ability until now.　</p>
<p>After all, wasn’t it hard to know the amount of one’s own strength? People said that one could understand how well their body worked, but that didn’t sound right to me.　</p>
<p>You see, a condition considered healthy by humans might not be considered healthy by a dog. It was something like that. It was often said that things that humans couldn’t understand might be better understood with the help of check-up tools.　</p>
<p>So yeah! The crystal was the best!　</p>
<p>Finally, my event came! Ah- I was actually worried since I wasn&#8217;t able to put on such a cool front during the entrance exam back then.</p>
<p>As expected, if I was the protagonist, shouldn’t I aim to be the best?　</p>
<p><em>—Ah, I guess I could just take the test after everyone else.</em>　</p>
<p>After all, wouldn’t the people after me seem pitiful if they were checked right after my ridiculously amazing result? It would make it awkward to do so. Well then, it seemed like everyone had checked theirs!　</p>
<p>Then, Arthur passed me the crystal.　</p>
<p>Well, the three would likely be considered average? Or perhaps they were actually amazing? Sensei looked very bewildered by their results but I didn’t understand since I had no such knowledge of it.　</p>
<p>Well then, let’s do this. I actually couldn’t feel my<em> art </em>well though. I thought that it would work if I just focused it on the tip of my finger… Alright!　</p>
<p>How was it? Yururu-sensei?!　</p>
<p>“Fay-kun… it seems that you only have non-elemental attributes…”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Fah?!　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Wha- what do you mean?! I panicked. It should be a lie, right?! Seriously?!　</p>
<p>I was the protagonist, I was the protagonist, calm down and think properly.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>……</p><div class="watas-12e8e3230083fcb8c51abe717ab2c839 watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-12e8e3230083fcb8c51abe717ab2c839"></div>
<p>　</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Well, I didn’t think this check-up had any meaning. After all, there was no way a mere roadside pebble could feel my potential. Wasn’t it said that a person knew themselves best? There was no way an inanimate object could measure the delicate and infinite possibility that humans have.</p>
<p>I was convinced now. As I nodded to myself, Yururu-sensei whispered to my ear.　</p>
<p>“U-uhm, please cheer up. I’m actually also like Fay-kun, only possessing non-elemental attributes.”　</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Ah, to have an instructor who had the same situation as me, perhaps this would be my flag for getting stronger… Maybe she was supposed to be the Master Character.　</p>
<p>[“The potential of the non-elementals… I will teach only you about it, Fay-kun.”]　</p>
<p>Ah- that would be the event. I guess I would have her teach me many things.　</p>
