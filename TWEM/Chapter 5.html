<h2>Chapter 5 &#8211; A Date in the Holy City</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we showed the receptionist the proof of subjugation, she was surprised to see an ogre king and two ogre generals, and apologized to us repeatedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason was that she had set the difficulty level incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am so sorry! I had no idea there would be two generals in addition to the ogre king&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist bowed deeply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s fine&#8230;oh, right. Asha, Kusel, you two should split the reward amongst yourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I handed over the reward, Asha was like, “I can’t!”, I had to persuade her to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel on the other hand was like, “Are you sure?”, I said to her, “It’s proof of your hard work”, and then handed it over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving the guild, we headed to a restaurant recommended by the receptionist, and decided to have lunch there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a reasonably busy restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After placing our orders and waiting for our food, Kusel made a suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, Asha, I&#8217;d like to take a look around the holy city a bit after this, if that’s all right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure thing. Count me in.”</span></p><div class="no-visibility-check ai-check-9-16243723" data-insertion-position="after" data-selector=".ai-check-9-16243723" data-code="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" data-block="9"><span class="ai-check-block ai-cfp" data-ai-block="9" data-ai-cfp-time="1"></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too. I&#8217;ll go with you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you talking about, taking a leisurely stroll through the holy city after a meal, sounds totally refreshing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Exactly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha nodded to my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a hearty lunch, we headed out to the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we were not traveling in a large group this time, I thought there would be less hassle&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey cuties, wanna hang out with——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Hieek?! Nevermind!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SORRY ABOUT THAT~!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are they tangled up in now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered. And then I stared at the two of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Kusel and Asha on a normal day, are quite the beauties.</span></p><div class="code-block code-block-1" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that they’re not in a group like yesterday may make it easier for them to be approached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel like we’re being stared at for a while now&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right? I’m feeling a lot of eyes on us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shook my head as Kusel and Asha said that looking at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re overthinking it. You shouldn&#8217;t be too conscious of it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it&#8217;s not like you can do anything about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess you’re right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After strolling around for a while and a good amount of time had passed, Asha stopped in front of a store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wondering what was going on, I followed Asha&#8217;s gaze and saw a beautiful, gorgeous outfit on display.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You like it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kya, Master Haruto?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha&#8217;s face turned bright red and she hurriedly waved her hands in front of her face to deny it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-Not really! I won’t look any good in something like that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then my voice overlapped with Kusel&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““I think you would!””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Huh?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha froze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You think so too right, Kusel?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yea. You should dress up more, Asha.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, that&#8217;s rich coming from you&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like you’re one to talk, Kusel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel widened her eyes at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, I can’t mention Kusel and fashion in the same sentence either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since you’re here, what do you say to picking out some new clothes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minute I said that, Asha pounced on her like a wolf that smelled blood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Exactly! You&#8217;re a beautiful woman, Kusel, and should definitely dress up more!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There you have it. Keep up you two, we’re going in.”</span></p><div class="no-visibility-check ai-check-2-12254172" data-insertion-position="after" data-selector=".ai-check-2-12254172" data-code="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" data-block="2"><span class="ai-check-block ai-cfp" data-ai-block="2" data-ai-cfp-time="1"></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walked into the store with the two of them in tow, and a store assistant immediately approached us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Welcome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The store was packed with women’s stuff, and the assistants seemed to be composed of only women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told the assistant what I wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t care how much it costs, just pick out clothes that will look good on both of them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assistant’s eyes lit up at those words. Three more assistants came and firmly grabbed Kusel and Asha by the arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““““Understood!””””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assistants said with big smiles on their faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“L-Let go of me! I ain’t wearing those——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“M-Me too, I don’t really——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two of them were dragged to the back of the store by the store assistants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded in satisfaction and relaxed on the sofa in the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After waiting for a while, Iris, Finne, Suzuno, and Ephyr passed by the front of the store, and then Iris and I locked eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walked out of the store and called out to the four of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey there, what a coincidence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you doing here, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four of them must have wondered what I was doing in a women&#8217;s store, and they came up to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Actually——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told them all about the events leading to the present starting from when we received the request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After I was done with the narration, the four of them nodded their heads seemingly convinced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm, I see.&nbsp; I do agree with you that Asha certainly does need to dress up a little more. She’s always wearing a maid&#8217;s uniform afterall.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kusel doesn&#8217;t dress stylishly either. She’s always in some rough-looking outfits.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know, right.&nbsp; Especially when Kusel is such a beauty, and Asha, who looks as cute as she does. Looking like that and not dressing up, is such a waste.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I couldn’t agree more, Suzuno.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I let out a sigh of relief in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I glanced around the store and saw that the store assistants were heading toward the fitting rooms with several clothes they had picked out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking to myself that this is going to take a while, next thing, Finne nodded her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How about we leave this to Haruto.”</span></p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re right. Good idea, Finne, so there you have it, we’ll leave the two in your care. Oh, and you&#8217;re taking a quest with us too!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris said and glanced up at me covertly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, how about we all go together tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yay!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris was delighted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Later then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing Iris and the others off and then returning to the store, Asha and Kusel had just finished changing and were coming out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assistant asked with a look of satisfaction on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“S-So, how do I look? Out of place right&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Master Haruto, um, how, do I look&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps feeling shy, both Kusel and Asha, who do not usually dress up, were blushing so hard, their cheeks were dyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel was wearing a red dress with her hair slicked back, and Asha was wearing a white one-piece dress with a simple, elegant hair clip in the front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You both look great. I definitely would like to see you dressed like this once in a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel and Asha, whose red faces turned even brighter at my impression, turned their faces away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how Iris and the rest would react.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing our exchange, the assistant tilted her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you like them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh yeah, they’re perfect. We’ll take them all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you very much! It was worth the effort!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After paying the bill, I urged Kusel and Asha so we could ‘return back’, but for some reason neither of them would move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing, just, can I please change back into my previous clothes&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-It’s too embarassing&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Come on, let&#8217;s go. Everyone is waiting for you guys!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, somehow forcing them out of the store and headed for the inn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way, all eyes were on Kusel and Asha, who were walking shyly behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Needless to say, not in a bad way, everyone was just curious about the beauties I had in tow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not a single one dared to approach them.</span></p><div class="no-visibility-check ai-check-4-47095745" data-insertion-position="after" data-selector=".ai-check-4-47095745" data-code="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" data-block="4"><span class="ai-check-block ai-cfp" data-ai-block="4" data-ai-cfp-time="1"></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason being, I was slightly intimidating the people around us. Wouldn’t want them to get tangled up with some strange people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a short walk, we arrived at the inn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““““H-How adorable (oh my gosh)!!””””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris and the others had returned to the inn shortly after we parted, and exclaimed as soon as they saw Asha and Kusel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two of them were crouched in the center of the room with their faces bright red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asha, there is no reason for you to be embarrassed. It looks very good on you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right.&nbsp; And you too, Kusel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ve never seen Asha dressed up like this before, but she looks so pretty&#8230;and Kusel looks even more beautiful&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kusel’s transformation is nothing short of amazing&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, Finne, Suzuno, and Ephyr all expressed their impressions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, too, nodded my head in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maybe I should have Asha serve me in that outfit from now on?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lady Iris?!&nbsp; Please, anything but that!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha looked up and pleaded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What to do, what to do, I wonder~?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris was smiling at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right, I also think it would be a good——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was about to finish my sentence, Asha turned to me with a face clearly seeking for help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her face was so red that it looked as if it might explode at any moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that, I felt sorry for Asha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alright everyone and Iris, that&#8217;s enough, y’all should leave Asha alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Leave her alone&#8230;okay, now you’re just trying to make me look bad. What do you expect me to do when she’s looking that adorable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fair point.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded in agreement with Iris, but then Asha&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh, aren’t you supposed to be helping me out&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, both Asha and Kusel were left dressed as they were for the rest of the day.</span></p>
