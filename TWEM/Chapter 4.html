<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Appearance of the True Hero</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phew, it looks like I made it just in time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I, Haruto saw Suzuno and the others stunned behind me, I breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pardon me. For coming so late.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo&#8217;s wound was deep, but there’s still time to save him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that you, Haruto?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yuki!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s Yuki!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“HARU, TO&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuno, Mogami, Shinonome, and Asakura shouted. Tendo, too, seems to be conscious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘My breath was blocked? &#8230;Who the hell are you? No, how did you get in here in the first place?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This voice that echoes in my head&#8230;must be the black dragon in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I didn’t respond to it, and instead handed potions to Shinonome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think there would be such a powerful dragon at the lowest floor. This is my fault, my bad&#8230;in the meantime, make sure Tendo drinks this potion, there&#8217;s enough for everyone. It&#8217;s safe and fast-acting, I guarantee it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;T-Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Shinonome gave the potion to Tendo, the wound began to heal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow, it’s healing really fast.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was smiling at the surprised Shinonome, who was probably not that surprised after all this time, the ignored Black Dragon shot out a black fireball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sheesh, can’t you see that I’m in the middle of something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The black fireball disappeared with a whoosh sound as I dismissed it with one hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What!? Who the hell are you?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The black dragon was trying to intimidate me, but I took no heed of his words and brushed it off.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-73903016' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-73903016' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m just passing through. Pay it no mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Like hell a mere passerby could put out my fireball.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What can be put out, can be put out. Don’t sweat the small stuff.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my words, the dragon became speechless and sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘——Well, whatever. So, how did you get in?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Over there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pointed in the direction I had come from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of me was&#8230;well, the wreckage of a massive door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The black dragon stared in round-eyed wonder and asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘That’s not something that could be wrecked so easily though&#8230;may I ask you something.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What brings you here?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s to help them. I&#8217;m the one who asked them to come here in the first place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘&#8230;I see. But now that you&#8217;re standing in front of me, hope you’re fully prepared?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Prepared to defeat you? I need no such thing&#8230;get on with it, lizard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dragon&#8217;s eyes narrowed as I unleashed more intimidation than the dragon had unleashed earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘More or less equal, perhaps even better&#8230;what&#8217;s your name?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Didn&#8217;t your mother teach you when asking for someone’s name, it’s polite to name yourself first?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Hmph, cheeky brat. Fine. My name is Gran Kalamiras, the Smelting Black Dragon. I am the ruler of this labyrinth and the strongest and oldest dragon. You don&#8217;t need to remember it though, since you’re about to die.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohh, I checked his status, and it looks like he possesses quite a lot of skills. I guess calling himself the strongest wasn’t beating his own drum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kalamiras. My name is Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Haruto, huh? I&#8217;ll remember it.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The space creaked as if screaming as the intimidation from both me and Kalamiras clashed.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTc5MjA2ODk4ODIiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You guys, stand back. I&#8217;ll put up a barrier to keep you safe. No matter what, do not try to leave the barrier.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said that and put up multiple barriers around them as they backed away to a location near the door. I was sure that Finne and the others will arrive soon enough, so I tweaked it so that my friends could come and go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And once again, I turned to face Kalamiras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well then, shall we get started. I don&#8217;t care who you are. I will crush you with all my might.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It goes without saying. Come on! Mighty one.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Kalamiras finished, I instantly closed the distance between us and struck him in the stomach with my fist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a heavy, dull thud, and Kalamiras retreated a few meters from the impact. I can&#8217;t believe that only caused him to move this much&#8230;guess I shouldn’t be surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras’ eyes widened, and he unleashed a breath that contained more magic power than I had been able to prevent, directed at Tendo and the others earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The breath at close range hit me where I stood, but I didn&#8217;t move&#8230;to be precise, I didn&#8217;t even need to move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only thing that remained after the breath was cut off was the scorched ground and me standing there unharmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘There&#8217;s no way you could take that head-on and remain&#8230;how did you do it?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras was looking down at me and asked me that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This guy is hopeless, and I could also choose not to answer, but what the heck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I just put up a barrier that has a spatial rupturing effect!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘&#8230;Why are you talking about such advanced technique as if it were an ordinary defensive magic spell?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can&#8217;t help what I can do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think I&#8217;ll try hitting him harder than before. Since he’s way sturdier than I thought.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I muttered this in a voice that was almost inaudible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The barrier covered my feet, so my foothold was safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stomped on the ground hard, leapt forward and swung my fist out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My fist dug into Kalamiras&#8217; gut again, making a duller, heavier sound than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Guoohh.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But again, it only set him back a few meters. I didn’t think it was totally ineffective, but it didn’t do much damage either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Your defense is admirable, but if you’re intending to only attack me with your fist? I’m afraid that’s not going to——’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rest assured, I’m just getting started!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What the?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I said that, I put light magic in both of my fists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fight darkness with light. Isn&#8217;t that a no brainer?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With those words, I released consecutive strikes into Kalamiras&#8217; stomach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dragon scales on his abdomen, which hadn&#8217;t even cracked earlier, cracked and peeled off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that didn&#8217;t stop the barrage of blows. Kalamiras was unable to fight back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Don’t you make light of meeeee!!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having grown impatient, a hemispherical shockwave was released from Kalamiras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was blown away because of my fist-throwing posture, but I adjusted my stance and landed in the air with the skill Sky Walk that allows one to walk through the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was far away enough, I took another look at Kalamiras’ belly, and saw that his dragon scales were peeling off in some places, and some parts were bleeding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It would seem that you’re not just all talk. Still&#8230;’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Kalamiras opened his mouth again and started to accumulate his dense magic power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto!!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time as Suzuno inside the barrier shouted my name, Kalamiras released his breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mana so concentrated to the point where it can no longer be called a breath but rather a laser most likely couldn’t be prevented by a half-hearted barrier or defense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I lowered my body deeply and moved into a quickdraw stance——then, a flash of light emerged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crimson flash of the sword shimmered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I activated the absolute cleave ability of my beloved black sword, Benizakura, and sliced apart the black flash of light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then the slash extended, cutting off Kalamiras&#8217; left arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;——GUURRRAAAAAAAAA!?</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-18748567' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-18748567' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras shouted in surprise and pain when his best shot was blocked and his left arm was dropped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But his gaze immediately turned to the sword I was holding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Nice job blocking my attack, &#8230;&#8230;. It looks like I&#8217;m no match for you after all. But as the ruler of this labyrinth, I can&#8217;t admit defeat so easily. So Haruto, if I may?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras seemed to realize that he could not defeat me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What&#8217;s the name of that sword? If by chance I defeat you, Haruto, I would like to have it.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t mind. You&#8217;re not going to be able to beat me anyway. Also, this is not a sword, it&#8217;s a blade. Its name is Black Katana Benizakura. My partner.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘A blade, huh? And what a beautiful name.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras realized he was defeated, but he didn&#8217;t seem to want to give up. His presence became even grander.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This place is big, but I can&#8217;t bring out my full strength with this body. And I&#8217;m too big to fight little ones.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That makes sense.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;I nodded my head in agreement that he was too big, and the next moment, a jet-black wind swirled around Kalamiras as if to envelop him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just like that, it gradually became smaller and smaller as it wrapped around the giant body of the dragon and formed a sphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as the sphere was about two meters in diameter, a crack appeared on the surface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cracks gradually widened, and when the sphere completely collapsed, standing there was a strong-looking, fine figure of a man, about 190 centimeters tall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had short hair and sharp golden eyes. He was dressed in a kind of kimono that I had seen in period dramas on Earth. He didn&#8217;t seem to know about my katana, so it made me wonder if such clothes existed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprisingly, his left arm had regenerated, even though it had been chopped off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been hundreds of years since I&#8217;ve looked like this&#8230;with this, I should be able to battle more efficiently don’t you think?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as he transformed into a humanoid form, he started to speak directly instead of that voice that echoed in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. So that’s what the Metamorphosis skill does huh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, it would seem you possess the appraisal skill. If so, then you should be most aware of my power&#8230;well then, shall we get started.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras said, extending his right arm horizontally to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then a sword appeared from under his feet, and Kalamiras grasped it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could tell from a glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sword is as good as my Black Katana Benizakura.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was curious and appraised it&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sword is even more outrageous than I expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I have the status effect immunity skill, so the curse of reduced ability won&#8217;t work on me&#8230;it shouldn’t right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gazed at Kalamiras with some apprehension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras swung his sword a few times, as if to check the comfort of his grip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment he took his stance, the battle resumed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His Sword clashed with my blade, and sparks flew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two sides clashed against each other, but soon they were out of range of each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then they approached each other again, and an exchange of sword fights ensued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Tendo and the others, this was a battle on a whole ‘nother dimension, and all they could do was watch.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne and the others arrived, but when they saw me in an intense sword fight with the enemy, they hurriedly entered the barrier occupied by Tendo and the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could hear the voices of these friends talking to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I gotta say, Haruto really is amazing. That dragon that didn&#8217;t take us seriously is now fighting with all he’s got&#8230;well, it&#8217;s probably because Haruto&#8217;s level is higher than ours.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can say that again. With a real life OP character right before my eyes, I don’t even know to be jealous.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Mogami who answered Tendo. Tendo, who smiled wryly, must have been thinking the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps taking advantage of the fact that I was focusing my attention on them, Kalamiras slashed at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I easily flipped off Kalamiras&#8217; sword and cut off his left arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh, aren’t you something. But I’m not done yet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras&#8217; severed arm turned into black mist and disappeared. Then, a black silhouette came out from the cut surface of his shoulder, and the arm regenerated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wha-, hey that’s foul play!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its speed is much faster than any super regeneration skill I have ever seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras swung his sword as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I dodged his sharp feint attacks with minimal movements and shifted the trajectory of his sword with my blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This went on for a few seconds, maybe even a few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Kalamiras pulled away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;re very good. What masterful prowess, to think you’re able to handle my swordplay&#8230;but, this is as far as you go. Let me put an end to this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras moved behind me in an instant and slashed at me diagonally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But right after that&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Agh!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I circled behind Kalamiras and kicked him in the back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh, when did you&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His eyes widened as if he couldn&#8217;t believe that I had gotten behind me in an instant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t mean to take his eyes off me, and I&#8217;m sure he didn&#8217;t expect me to move faster than he did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras came up behind me again. However&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You should learn to disguise your presence a little better. If you&#8217;re leaking all that bloodlust and energy, you may as well be broadcasting your location.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grabbed his right arm before he could swing his sword down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras shook off my hand and backed away again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He took a deep breath, and his mood and appearance changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His skin was covered with black dragon scales, his hair, which had been black, was now a fiery red, he grew two horns on his head, just like when he was a dragon, and he had a tail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I had to name it, I would call it&#8230;Dragonoid Transformation, or something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, I’ve become serious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Looks like it. Be sure to entertain me, will ya?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mana was thicker than ever, and it surrounded Kalamiras as if it were wrapped around him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the blink of an eye, Kalamiras approached me and unleashed a blow with his left fist, which was covered with dragon scales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, I quickly tried to catch it with one hand and was hit with another fist from the side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The left fist was a feint, and the right hook connected squarely as hard as it could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was blown away and rolled on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As everyone screamed in shock, I quickly got up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ain’t this a surprise. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve taken any real damage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For what it’s worth, this is probably the first time I&#8217;ve taken this kind of damage since I got the cheat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. Then I guess you should be prepared to take in a lot more damage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am going to have to pass, thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I observed Kalamiras with amusement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hadn&#8217;t expected his fighting strength to increase this much. This guy, in his current state, would most likely defeat even the Demon King.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-97135104' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-97135104' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps those scales won&#8217;t let a blade through. Now that it’s come to this, it might be more prudent to fight with my fists rather than my blade&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the next moment, Kalamiras jumped in again in an instant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had been caught off guard earlier, but this time I could see his movements clearly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I couldn’t handle all the attacks and had to receive some squarely with my body&#8230;but the same applied to him as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We inflicted damage on each other, and while barraging each other with our fists, we also slashed at each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This went on for a while, but it didn’t look like we were going to be wrapping things up anytime soon, so I distanced myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I cast a recovery spell on myself, Kalamiras smiled happily, breathing on my shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, are you at your limit?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Keep dreaming. I just thought it was time for me to get serious as well&#8230;try not to die too fast, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmph, what nonsense——&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I interrupted Kalamiras&#8217; words and released the limiter on myself, unleashing my magic power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Kalamiras saw the crimson mana raging out of my body, his cheeks tensed up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s the matter. Are you perhaps feeling unwell?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m fine. It&#8217;s nothing serious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s a relief——then, shall we continue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I finished, Kalamiras approached, wielding his sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wha—?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Kalamiras&#8217;s eyes, it must have looked like the sword had sliced through me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But my slashed figure disappeared as if it were melting into the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;——Kagero!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I whispered behind Kalamiras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When did he—?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he turned around, the sword cleaved through me, but that too disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can&#8217;t keep up with me anymore.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My blade protruded from Kalamiras&#8217; stomach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;ugh, agh, ughhh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I pulled out my blade and put it into its sheath, Kalamiras immediately healed his wound and was about to slash at me when he fell to his knees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uh, aghh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess he didn&#8217;t know what had happened to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he saw that both of his legs had been obliterated by my magic bullets, Kalamiras finally let out a scream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I kicked away Kalamiras&#8217; sword and shot a magic bullet into his arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras continued to heal his wounds, but each time I fired a magic bullet at him, not allowing him to even stand up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he had used so much mana that his regeneration could no longer keep up, I drew my blade and placed it around his neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras, who had probably used up the last of his magic power to regenerate his limbs, looked up at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn it, just kill——&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Would you like to be my subordinate?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras, who had been looking up at me resolved to his fate, paused at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be reassuring to have such a strong guy in my group, and I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s exactly bad either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want you. That&#8217;s all. What do you think? And if you stick with me, you might even grow stronger than you are now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamiras pondered my offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And after a few minutes of thought, the words that came out of Kalamiras were&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;——You may, no, please take me under your command, Master Haruto.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. Looking forward to working with you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gotcha, now I&#8217;ve got a powerful comrade!</span></p>
