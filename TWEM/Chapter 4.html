<h2>Chapter 4 &#8211; Ogre King</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, I detected a sign of what seemed to be another horde of ogres.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this time, there were three reactions much larger than the normal ogres.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two were only slightly larger, but the other one was much larger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re but small fries to me, but Asha and Kusel will have a hard time with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asha, Kuzel. Can you two sense that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said with a serious expression, and they nodded their heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Ogre King and two Ogre Generals who are probably his cronies. I don’t mind dealing with them&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, if it looks like Asha and I are going to be in trouble.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fine. I&#8217;ll take care of the regular ogres then, sound good?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After discussing amongst themselves, Kusel asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, please. Fighting the two generals and the king while also having to deal with the other ogres would be&#8230;maybe not totally impossible, but a little overwhelming to say the least.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, Master Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few moments later, a horde of ogres appeared in front of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both ogre generals were holding a rusty weapon like a butcher knife in one hand, and the ogre king was holding a long sword in one hand as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel muttered when she saw them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is definitely not a quest for an A-rank.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can say that again. Even if an A-rank party were to take on the challenge, they’ll only be seeking their doom.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha beside me was nodding in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An A-rank inching on S-rank, really, what a load of crap, this is a straight-up S-rank quest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I heard there are no S-rank adventurers in this country, so they were probably waiting for an A-rank party to take it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing us leisurely thinking about this, the ogres ready their weapons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre king made a gesture as if ordering his subordinates to attack, and they all attacked at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well then, I&#8217;ll take care of the small fries, so I&#8217;ll leave you two to deal with those three.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel and Asha sneakily ran through the approaching horde of ogres to the ogre generals and ogre king positioned at the back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogres, noticing that they’ve gotten past them, tried to get back, only to be stopped by an invisible wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They hit and punched it, but the invisible wall didn’t budge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a barrier that I personally erected, no friggin’ chance it will break from just that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll be the one entertaining you ugly sons of bitches.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogres reacted to my voice and turned around. There were about ten of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I won&#8217;t tolerate you getting in their way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I lightly released my intimidation to attract their attention. If I was too intimidating, they might run away, so I kept it to a minimum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just as I had hoped, the ogres began to close in on me——and then attacked all at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some clenched their fists, some held thick fallen trees with both hands, and some held large rocks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, I decided not to draw my blade, but to use only magic and martial arts to fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I parried the fist strike, and with a twisting palm strike to the unguarded belly of the ogre, shot a large hole through, killing it instantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I evaded the one with the huge tree by crouching down and releasing a mass of compressed air with wind magic to blow it away. It should have just blown it away, but perhaps the force was too strong, and like the first ogre, a large hole appeared in its belly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oops, that was a little too much, wasn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was saying that, huge chunks of rock came flying at me from both sides, and at the same time, a huge tree swung down from behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rocks came at me so fast, but a moment later they collided and crushed each other, and the huge tree swung down on top of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I was already gone, and the ogres looked puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Looking for me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said this, I unleashed a compressed mass of mana——a magic bullet from above and shot two ogres right between the eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogres, seemingly angered by the defeat of nearly half of their comrades, approached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogres appear to be on the more intelligent side compared to other monsters, but they showed no signs of running away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Makes sense, because even if they wanted to, they can’t&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, just chalk it up to bad luck.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I defeated the approaching ogres in an instant and decided to release the barrier to watch the fight of those two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha and Kusel seemed to be putting up a good fight despite the two-against-three handicap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel draws their attention and Asha takes advantage of the opportunity to attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Asha&#8217;s knife could not penetrate through the thick skin of the ogre general and ogre king, and Kusel seemed to have no chance to strike an effective blow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, they’re up against two A-rank ogre generals and an S-rank ogre king, both of which are nothing to scoff at.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although both Asha and Kusel had become stronger, they were not easy opponents to defeat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even so, Kusel seemed to be putting up a better fight than expected, perhaps thanks to the results of her training with Zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In your dreams!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel dodged the attack of the ogre general and swung her sword with a spirited voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre general, perhaps not expecting her to avoid the attack, reacted too late, and its right arm was slashed off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GUOOOOOOOOOOHHHHhh?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre general screamed out in pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the other ogre general was about to swing its large butcher knife at Kusel who was now defenceless from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was about to make a move, but then I noticed Asha moving and decided to stay put.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha, while keeping the ogre king firmly in check, threw her knives and pinned both legs of the ogre general, that was aiming at Kusel&#8217;s back, to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, Kusel!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nice one!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as she noticed Asha&#8217;s restraint, Kusel dove within range of the ogre general, the one with the arm chopped off, raised her sword, and sliced the ogre general in two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s one down!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel shook off the blood on her sword, and stared at the ogre king, and the ogre general, whose legs were pinned to the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their coordination just now was nothing short of brilliant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that split second, Kusel understood what Asha was trying to communicate and firmly finished off the enemy. How I would like to praise them right now, but the battle is still ongoing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, both of them seemed to be on their toes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s moving again, Kusel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Copy that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre general pulled out the knives stuck in its legs to keep it still, and pointed its weapon at Asha and Kusel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre king also seemed to be angry at the fact that one of its ogre generals had been slain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They both seemed to be raring to go, Asha and Kuzel on the other hand also seemed to still have some fight left in them from what I can see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asha, I&#8217;m going in. Cover me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha nodded to Kusel&#8217;s instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re taking out the general first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the two of them just standing there, the ogre general, perhaps annoyed with their reluctance to take action, swung its huge meat cleaver at them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Kusel successfully deflected the meat cleaver with the flat side of her sword. With the meat cleaver deflected from course, it pierced into the ground with the momentum from the swing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asha!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel shouted her name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if she knew it was going to happen, Asha threw the knife she was holding at the ogre general&#8217;s eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GUOOOOOOOOOOHHHHhh?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre general, covering its eye where the knife had pierced, screamed in pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel wasn’t going to miss this opportunity and she closed in with her weapon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre general noticed Kusel, but the distance was too close to react.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was very close to beheading the ogre general——but the ogre king&#8217;s long sword came homing in on Kuzel from the side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“KUSEL!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel noticed it thanks to the outcry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“U-Uggh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She quickly guarded herself and avoided a direct hit from the blade, but was blown away by the impact and rolled on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she quickly regained her stance, and Asha immediately rushed over to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you okay?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;! I’m fine. That aside, dodge!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two quickly jumped back and avoided the long sword that the ogre king swung at them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha, seeing the long sword thrust deeply into the ground, broke out in a cold sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps she was thinking about what would happen if she took a direct hit. Her legs were trembling, her mind must have been stricken with fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, snap out of it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha, with a reprimand from Kusel, just barely avoided another swing from the ogre king.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s the matter?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-Nothing. I&#8217;m fine!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asha deflected the question, and Kusel didn’t bother asking anything more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably because they’re currently in the middle of a battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I need you to get yourself together!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roger!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha responded as if she was trying to rouse herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing her like that made me a little uneasy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe the most dangerous thing in combat is getting paralyzed by fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But letting go of the fear of death is also the most difficult thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder how she will respond in this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asha, cover me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel said in a strong tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two resumed fighting, but they were having difficulty defeating them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha&#8217;s movements were becoming slower than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No surprises there, Asha is not accustomed to fighting against such strong enemies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for now, she has no choice but to get over it on her own. I&#8217;m ready to step in at any moment, but I hope she&#8217;ll give her very best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few moments later, Kusel succeeded in killing the ogre general, whose movement had become sluggish thanks to the leg wound it sustained earlier, with a single blow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that’s left now is the ogre king.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How they go about fighting is up to the two of them, but even from an objective point of view, the ogre king’s movements are slow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But each blow is powerful, and if the two of them were to take a hit, they would be utterly helpless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel, Asha, and the ogre king, as if to make a fresh start, readied their weapons and made their moves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the ogre king attempted to swing its long sword at Kusel who was closing in, it was struck in the face by Asha&#8217;s throwing knives from the side, stopping its movement for a moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that moment, Kusel moved right under the ogre king, and with all her might, slashed the ogre in the stomach diagonally. The ogre king screamed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it was a shallow blow. And before Asha could follow up, its swinging fist hit Kusel squarely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Guaaahh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She guarded herself, but the blow was so heavy that Kusel was blown away upon impact and hit the tree behind her hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“KUSEL!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Asha screamed, Kusel stood up, using her sword as a walking stick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the looks of it, two ribs and her right arm are broken, and doesn&#8217;t look like she can continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kusel!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I called out to her and tried to approach her, but she stopped me by stretching her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don&#8217;t. It’s not over yet! I’m not about to throw in the towel over this ugly-ass bitch&#8230;!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She glared at the ogre king, holding her sword in one hand. Somehow, I feel that her presence has been sharpened even more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha stared at Kusel in such a state and muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why, why are you pushing yourself to fight to that extent&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel answered with a smile, as if she had heard Asha&#8217;s little murmur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because I&#8217;m me——nah, not quite. Because fighting is fun! And a fight to the death is unparalleled!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel twisted her mouth into a sneer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asha, Haruto. You mind if I take this guy, the ogre king, alone?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel asked, but before I could say anything, Asha strongly refused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No way, I want to fight alongside you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel&#8217;s eyes widened at those words, and she asked Asha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aren’t you scared shitless?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a small gasp, Asha looked back at Kusel with fiery eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought I had become stronger, and somewhere in my heart I was optimistic. And yet when I saw Kusel getting done in right in front of me, I suddenly got scared. But——”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha gripped her weapons tightly and stared at the ogre king.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can&#8217;t afford to run away from this in order to fight together with you all from here on——and to fight alongside Lady Iris! Besides, I am sure Lady Iris will laugh at me if I run away from this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha smiled. She seemed to have discarded her fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Very good. I’m sure Iris will be pleased too&#8230;sorry Haruto, forget what I just said. Asha and I will take this guy down.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You heard Kusel! The two of us will take it down together!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel and Asha said as they turned their backs to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What promising statements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do as you please. As long as you don&#8217;t end up causing me any grief, got it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You bet!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Leave it to us!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then they both glared at the ogre king.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha notified Kusel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My attacks can’t deal a fatal blow. So I’m going to create an opening instead, then you aim for it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay. I’m also running low on fumes myself. So I’m counting on ya.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel and Asha nodded to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GUOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH?!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre king raised its battle cry, and approached Asha and Kusel wielding its long sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha approached the ogre king as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre king swung its long sword down on Asha in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just before the sword hit Asha, she disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre king looked around, unable to a glimpse of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, however, Asha appeared behind the ogre king.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She must have utilized the blind spot of the long sword to move at high speed at the same time it overlapped on her figure. This is a move that would have been possible only if she had kept close watch on ogre king’s eye movements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha, with the ogre king backing her, hurled several knives at it, and although some of them failed to penetrate, she succeeded in making it turn around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre king tried swinging its long sword, but Asha was quicker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the well-aimed knives pierced the ogre king&#8217;s eye. The one aimed at the other eye only grazed its cheek, but it was more than enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre king let out a shrill cry, caught Asha with its other eye, and swung its sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha managed to block it by crossing the knives in her hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she was knocked away and rolled on the ground in a heap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still unable to move due to the pain, the ogre king approached her and raised its long sword in the air, in an attempt to kill her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You seem to have forgotten that I’m not alone, haven’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And at the same time Asha said this to the ogre king.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Exactly! I can’t have you treating me like fart now, can I!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel&#8217;s voice rang out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She leapt and was about to swing her sword at the ogre king, who turned around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her body was overflowing with mana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre king guarded itself with the long sword without hesitation, but Kusel struck head-on with her sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sword sparks flew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“YOU’RE GOING DOOOOOOOOWN!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel forced the sword further back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks like she’s using the Berserk Switch skill, that increases her stats in exchange for losing rationality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t expect her to use it after coming this far. Still&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m surprised she’s able to maintain her sense of self.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite evoking Berserk Switch, Kusel was still herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could this be the result of her training with Zero, or perhaps she mastered the skill at this last minute&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, it should all be over soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel was pressing the sword forward while the ogre king was pushing back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadlock continued, but it’s already at its climax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sword Kusel was pressing forward slowly began to cut into the long sword the ogre king was using to push back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel pushed even further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, the long sword split apart, and Kusel&#8217;s sword closed in on the ogre king.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre king, having lost its weapon, was cut in two with a single slash from above its head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ogre king was split in half and fell to the ground, spewing blood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting her sword back in its sheath, Kusel, exhaled, “Whew!”. From the looks of it, she has undone her skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two of them had spectacularly come out the victor against the ogre king.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel walked up to Asha and gently held out her hand, though she was still a little wobbly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was brilliant, Asha. If it wasn’t for that decoy, it would have been a close call.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha grabbed the offered hand and got up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not at all. It’s all thanks to you, Kusel. Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel smiled at Asha&#8217;s words, but suddenly became unsteady.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, go figure. She’s wounded all over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly moved to catch her as she was about to fall and immediately used my recovery magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel sounded somewhat apologetic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sorry, Haruto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don&#8217;t worry about it. More importantly, both of you did a spectacular job taking it down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, thanks to Asha. I certainly couldn&#8217;t have done it alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not true!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha said, clasping both of Kusel&#8217;s hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I shouldn’t have gotten cold feet all of a sudden like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha&#8217;s eyes filled with tears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I see. But you see, Asha. In the end, it&#8217;s all thanks to you. You should be proud of that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After I finished treating Kusel and Asha and sat them down, I looked up to the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sun was already high up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was about the time I had expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I was thinking that, I heard their stomachs growling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I said to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shall we head back. And, let&#8217;s go have lunch, I’m sure you’re hungry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so we returned to the holy city after collecting the necessary parts for the quest.</span></p>
