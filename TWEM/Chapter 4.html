<h3>Chapter 4: Holy Land Infiltration </h3>


<p class="calibre1">Ellen and Falma were observing the cathedral when someone came outside. She was a devout believer and was often seen here. Ellen and Falma called her over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, the Other World Pharmacy’s shopkeeper-sama. Bonnefoy-sama as well” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elderly woman was a frequent customer of the pharmacy as wel , so she recognized Falma’s face. She was also an acquaintance of Ellen’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello. Was the head priest replaced?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right. Just a week prior, you know” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why was that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From what I’ve heard, the previous head priest-sama was taken to the Holy Kingdom on charges of treason… rumors are that he’s been imprisoned. It seems like the new head priest was sent by the Holy Kingdom directly” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t forget, it’s only a rumor, the elderly lady reminded them with a lowered voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She shook her head. It’s a shame, I thought the previous head priest-san was a good person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was the act of treason?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma kept asking questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that’s…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it seemed that the elderly lady didn’t know the details. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If we’re talking about treason rather than betrayal, that’s quite a severe crime. The punishment could be the death penalty or the forced closing of one’s divine circuits” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s likely very serious, Ellen said again with a gloomy expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think… it’s probably my fault” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma spoke haltingly as he confided his feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given Falma’s reputation within the Imperial City, it’s not surprising that information about  him  had  leaked  to  the  Holy  Kingdom.  Ellen  knew  that  Solomon  had  been preventing leaks by stopping them at the source, but it seems that rumor have spread, and Solomon couldn’t hide the information any further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Before, the Holy Kingdom ordered that the boy without a shadow be found” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t realize…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen also thought that it was only a matter of time before the Holy Kingdom noticed Falma. However, she didn’t think about it too much because there was no point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Still,  depending  on  the  situation,  the  death  penalty?  Aren’t  they  a  religious organization?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma denounced it as being a bit too ruthless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Holy Kingdom is a hierarchical society. To betray the High Priest, who can open and close divine circuits, is severely punished” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon hearing that, Falma reached for the Medicine God’s staff that rested by his hip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe this is why he’s being accused of treason… it seems that losing treasure is a serious crime” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The word treason could apply too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Falma’s  hands,  the  Medicine  God’s  staff  shone  with  divine  power.  It  not  only withstood Falma’s power, but also amplified it. It was one-of-a-kind and couldn’t be replaced, so to say that Falma felt no attachment to it would be a lie. However, Falma could use divine arts even without a staff, and it was more important to free Solomon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing was more important than human life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma didn’t succumb to the temptation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to return this staff to the cathedral. Solomon-san lent it to me, but I think they suspect that he lost it” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you can’t use any other staffs, right? Isn’t this just a waste of an opportunity? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wouldn’t it be better to get permission to use it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen was reluctant to return something that was unusable. However, it’s hard to deny that this was similar to stealing from the Holy Kingdom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was able to use this through the generosity of Solomon-san, but I don’t know the Holy Kingdom, so I don’t think it’s right for me to keep using this. I’ll return it and ask for Solomon-san to be released in exchange” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma resolved himself and entered the cathedral of San Fleuve. The atmosphere was completely different from when Solomon was the head priest. “It’s dangerous to go alone”, said Ellen as she followed him inside. When Falma stepped inside the cathedral, the floor lit up with a pale blueish-white color. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cathedral’s floor had detected Falma’s divine power and the entire cathedral was turned into a sanctuary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eh-?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen was speechless. She didn’t think the cathedral would glow in response to Falma’s power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t the cathedral amazing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, if this is the case, you’ll be found even if you try to hide…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Ellen’s first time seeing the cathedral  react  to Falma, so she was surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring her reaction, Falma looking around for the new head priest. Upon confirming that he wasn’t in the  chapel, Falma immediately headed towards the head priest’s office as Ellen followed. Light leaked out from behind the door to the office. The new head priest was inside. Falma raised his voice and called out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma settled down and climbed into the Sanctuary of the Emperor San-Fleuve. The atmosphere of the church had changed completely from when Salomon was the head </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">priest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s dangerous to go alone,” said Ellen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Falma steps into the church, the floor of the church glows pale and pulsating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  was  the  moment  when the  floor  detected  the  power  of  Falma  and  the  entire church becomes a sanctuary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">El en, who saw it, shouted. I didn’t think the church would shine in response to the Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right. It’s the Holy Church.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m afraid I would be caught right away….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen was surprised because it was the first time she had seen the church’s reaction to Falma. Regardless of Ellen’s reaction, Falma found the new head priest. He had made sure he wasn’t in the chapel. He went straight into the head priests’ room. El en followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Light leaked through the door of the Head priests’ office. The new head priest seemed to be in the room. Falma called out in a loud voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good-day, I am sorry to trouble you when you’re busy. May I have a word with you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The new head priest came out of the door with his cane on his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was on guard because there had been an abnormality all over the church. Perhaps the flame of the candlestick, which caught fire at the sight of the divine power, was on fire. But he seemed to understand everything when he saw the Falma with the stick and the floor of the glowing church. He looked at the Falma from head to toe and smiled broadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is it. I was going to say a few words, but it’s an honor to be with you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">The new head priest was a middle-aged man wearing glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice to meet you, I am Com, the new head priest. It’s good to see you, Medicine God-sama.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My name is Falma de Medicis, not Medicine God. I thought you were looking for me, so I came. I apologize for using this for so long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He returned the wand to Com with both hands, but the Com didn’t accept it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I beg your pardon, but will you come and return it directly to the Holy Church? We cannot keep it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Com’s words made Falma feel strange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me. Is the Holy church in the Holy Land?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen checks to Com. It is inconvenient for Falma, who cannot leave the imperial capital easily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You may not be able to hold it without a sheath, but if you hold a sheath, anyone can hold it without touching a cane. Wouldn’t it be fine to give it back here? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because the wand penetrates organic matter, people cannot use it or hold it directly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he knew that he could carry it in inorganic boxes and other things. So Salomon brought this wand to the pharmacy. Falma didn’t always have the Medicine God’s wand on his hand. Sometimes, lying on the stone floor and leaning against it, and lying in a sheath on his loins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Still, I would be grateful if you could come directly to the Holy Church and explain the circumstances.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma was on guard when he heard the word “Holy Church” for Salomon had said that he might be taken into custody by the Holy Church. If they knew that he was possessed by Medicine God. As the guardian deity, aside from the fact that it would be complicated, if he went to the Holy Land, he would like to be excused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s difficult for him to go to a Holy Land because he has work to do…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen also seemed suspicious and tried to refuse. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d like to see you, Salomon-san. Where is he now? Can I see him at the church?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma carefully chose his words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They must make concessions and find out where Salomon was detained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I think so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s Salomon-san?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma didn’t miss Com’s glance for a few seconds. So Falma nailed him quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t he alive?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,  of  course.  I  think  that  the  veins  were  shut  down  to  make  them  take  some responsibility.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why… the closure of the veins?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen sympathized with Salomon. Salomon, who lost his magical powers, must have been expelled from the church as a commoner and must be in dire circumstances, waiting. Falma said to Com, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please send a dove to a Holy Land. Tell him that you will return the wand and go to the Holy Land to see Salomon. If I can’t see Salomon-san, I won’t go to the Holy Land.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if the penalty has been decided, it will not be carried out immediately. Salomon was like being held, hostage. For Falma, Salomon was a good understanding person and the desire to protect him grew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right. We will arrange for the carriage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Com wanted to hurry to the Holy Land for Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, but… how are you going to come back, Falma? If you don’t have a pharmacist, it will take you a week to come back from the Holy Land.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen worried that something might happen, so she would follow. Falma thanked Ellen for her kindness and asked Com-san </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you think it’s al  right to wait for a while. I have a doctor’s duty to finish. I have a lot of patients, and some are dying when I’m away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the patients are undergoing chemotherapy. Palle is now able to use his own medicine to some extent. But without Falma around, he will be exposed to a variety of infection risks and will soon catch an infection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon’s life is important, but Palle’s life and the patient’s life are also important. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can wait for a week or so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Com made a concession. They seemed to be a little flexible about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I’m going to the Holy Land. I’m sorry to have let you use the treasure at your disposal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, I don’t care. It’s Salomon’s fault.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Com groaned in a good mood. Shortly afterward, however, Falma’s next remark froze him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I will only come after I have told the Empress, Her Majesty Elizabeth” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, to your Majesty? What does the Empress have to do with it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Com’s face, full of joy, turned pale and confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As you may not know, my pharmacy had an imperial-owned and licensed pharmacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I am prohibited from leaving the country without reporting to your Majesty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And…!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The San Fleuve Empire was the most powerful empire in the world today and the Empress who ruled it had a great deal of power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no country in the world today that can win a direct war against the San Fleuve Empire. It was no exception, even to the Holy Land, which monopolizes the secrets of magic arts and holds the supreme power of the world. Even if the priests shut down the veins of all the nobility in the San-Fleuve Empire and made them impotent, only by the strength of the peacetime soldiers, they would crush to death the little country </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">such as Holy Land. It was also such a military power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the crying children say a word to the Emperess and then officially leave the country, they will have to return Falma safely. He was not “just a pharmacist” who could have disappeared with the authority of the church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen stopped at the dumbfounded Com. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At the same time, he is one of the head court pharmacists. Meaning that he cannot easily leave within a few days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A head pharmacist is a pharmacist who has the most trusted position in the country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This empress was known for her short temper. Would she be in danger of losing her chief court pharmacist to the Holy Land? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, yes, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Com’s face twitched. He was scared when the empress’s name came out. Though he was glad to see the pharmacist come to the church on his own, he was not alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His position in the empire was more solid than he had thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well… I’ll ask the Holy Church to judge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">First of all, Falma’s trip to the Holy Church was suspended. It was allowed that Falma should possess the staff until the judgment was rendered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Salomon-san, you said your veins were closed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the way home from the church, Falma checks with Ellen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think it’s harder for the head priest than to die.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To put it bluntly, it was an irreparable treatment for a magician. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can the veins open and close?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, but I think there’s a way to prevent it from opening again… as I said, it’s probably over there. I hope it’s such a disgrace that you shouldn’t kill yourself early.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen held her head that she was more worried about the proud head priest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That night, Falma returned to the house and could not sleep. I don’t know what kind of  treatment  Salomon  is  being  treated  now  because  he  has  been  forced  from  the position of head priest, and his veins have been closed… </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don’t know what to do, but I felt responsible for involving him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I enter a Holy Land, I wonder if something will happen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I remember Salomon’s words that I’ve always exchanged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He said that he would go into the darkness to see the great treasure in the church and that it was possible. Salomon recognizes that they can’t get into the house at night when security is weak. It is a temple which reveals the existence of Falma very keenly, but it does not react unless it touches the floor directly. In other words, you don’t have to put your feet on the floor or touch the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though he sent a dove from the empire to the Holy Land to inform them of the existence of Falma, the letter would not yet have reached the Holy Land. In the meantime, if anything should happen to him, he could not sleep leisurely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma got out of bed, held his wand and opened the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shall we get on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wanted to confirm his safety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter where Salomon was or where he was confined, he had the confidence to be able  to  find  Salomon  in  an  instant  above  the  sacred  land  by  using  his  medical examination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s because Salomon has congenital abnormalities. I could see it from the Divine eye,  but  I  didn’t  care  about  it  as  it  didn’t  interfere  with  my  daily  life.  Salomon’s characteristic is about one out of every 7,000 people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Judging from the number of priests, there must be only one person in a holy land. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">He was a completely visceral inversion, reverse to normal in all visceral positions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Salomon-san,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At midnight, in the cel  of a prison cel  in a snow-bound holy land, Salomon, shuddering with cold, heard a little groan outside the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it…? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s Falma”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking out of the window, I saw a boy floating on a stick. In the darkness, Falma came as far as the window of the prison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, what’s this, my dear… Falma-sama?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon is surprised at the appearance of Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was simply incomprehensible to think how he had come to this point, and how he knew that Salomon was imprisoned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know very little of the situation, but I don’t know if it’s because of me… I thought.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a great distance from the Imperial capital to the Holy Land. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma  used his wand to fly.  Falma  has been  heavily  clothed to fly  over the winter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though his body trembled with cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did you know this place?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have some instruments. I was worried, and I’m glad you’re safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma revels and rejoices in his safety. As expected, there was only one person who was completely visceral in the sky above the sacred land. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, I’m sorry, sir, for such a trifling man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon wept with delight and regret. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you for your service, Salomon-san, and it’s nothing of the sort.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you…….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon was too much obliged to say the last word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I enter this cell, will I be detected by any special means?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, this cell is the priests who got their cane deprived from them. It is not made of that material.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma erased the iron bars with the ability and slid through a small window into the cell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He also erased the iron handcuffs and footprints that they had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What art is this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon was surprised, but he could no longer hide his hand to Salomon. He was a man to be trusted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I don’t think I’m still a magician. I’m afraid I can’t feel your divine power.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You shut down your veins, after all. Can’t we reopen it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma feels like he can’t do it. It was irreparable for Salomon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It depends on how you close it. For the three days, it will not open again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Salomon fell on his head. It’s already been five days since he was treated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you tell me how to open veins? I’ll try.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma wanted to try it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If it were closed over time, wouldn’t it be possible to force it open with a stick? That’s what he thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think you can do anything impossible, but…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want to try. Please tell me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma recited the long chant of Salomon, and ended up with a vocal chant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[The springing up the Holy Spring] </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tip of the talisman wand hits Salomon’s chest and Falma gives him the image of returning  his  power.  It  is  said  that  the  veins  are  opened  and  closed  with  a  cane attached to the head or heart. The heart is easier to open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…It’s futile, ne?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it was not so easy to open.The operation to open and close the veins was completed and no tear was found. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I’ll put in my cane.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma took the plunge and stabbed Salomon in the heart with the tip of his stick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s an inverted visceral position, so stick it on the right side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hii–” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma knew that no matter where you stab him, he can penetrate without hurting his body. So I thought that if I stabbed him directly into the heart, I could attract the power of the gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A pale light flashed before Falma repeated the same long chant, thrusting it through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh!? Oh!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time things changed completely. From the moment, Falma wished to open the divine  veins  of  Salomon,  the  divine  powers  began  to  return  to  him.  Divine  power pervaded him, and more force flowed in, out of nowhere than before. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think it’s a miracle — thank you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon could not stop his mouth, while his veins remained open. As Salomon wanted it, the power of the gods rose. He could not feel his power without a cane, but Salomon understood that it was not just a matter of course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m glad the Divine Power has returned. You can’t close it anymore because you forced it to open.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was afraid I should be shut down again, but I didn’t have to worry about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, it was held without a chorus, so I don’t have a chorus to close.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chants of opening and closing the veins form a pair of chants when they are closed and when they are opened. If one side is unvoiced, it must be unvoiced when it is closed. In other words, it can only be closed by Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s run away before morning comes.” </p>
