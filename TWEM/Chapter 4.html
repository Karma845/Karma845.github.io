<p>Arthur was ridiculously strong. No, her strength couldn’t be defined to be merely “strong.”</p>
<p>The wooden sword seemingly changed into something like a whip. Having moved so fast to the point that I was unable to see its original shape. All the hard work I had desperately put in for two years didn’t work against this girl named Arthur at all.　</p>
<p>My sword was flung away and flipped through the air like a boomerang.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Eh? What- <em>what</em>? She… really was absurdly strong though… wasn’t this ridiculous? It was too ridiculous, right? Truly, ridiculously powerful. This was very annoying. What was annoying you may ask? She never even used her sword to hit my body.　</p>
<p>After she knocked my sword away, she had this face silently saying, “Hurry up and pick it up, will you?” When I noticed, the other applicants were laughing at my awkward state. It made me upset to be seen that way!!　</p>
<p>But!!!　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong><em>—I-I am the protagonist. Regardless of what others say or laugh at, I am still the protagonist.</em></strong></p>
<p>That was why I wouldn’t give up. Something like an awakening or whatever that led to my victory will definitely happen.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Ah, my sword was sent flying again.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“…Why is it so ugly?”　</p>
<p>“…What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean it literally though…?”</p>
<p>This fool said something ridiculous while tipping her head down, pretending to be a cute girl.　</p>
<p>…I will seriously beat her up. I also have my pride as a protagonist.　</p>
<p>“Whatever. Let’s continue.”　</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She may be the stronger one between us, but I would win no matter what.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“…Let’s just end it here… I can’t stand seeing it anymore, the thing that Fay showed me.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Was she trying to provoke me? Even though she had such a grand name like Arthur. Uwah, so she was the kind of character who drew aggro from viewers through her sarcasm despite being a beauty, that was too bad. 　</p>
<p>But she had a decent amount of strength. Un, in that case, perhaps she would be more like a lifelong rival?　</p>
<p>A rival-type character with a bad personality was quite commonplace after all… Well, I guess it was something like that. She might be the type of character who looked down on the protagonist at the beginning, until she eventually learns of the protagonist&#8217;s strength and changes her ways.　</p>
<p>In that case, I was convinced.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“It’s over…”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>You sure were annoying, constantly spouting that it was over. I was the one who decided when it would be over! I rushed at her! Then once again, I swung my sword upward.　</p>
<p>This girl was totally underestimating me. She no longer held her sword properly and just had it in her hand.　</p>
<p>I would make her regret underestimating me and hold my sword to her neck.　</p>
<p>I swung up with that thought. She looked surprised, but then swung her sword at speed faster than before, and knocked my sword away again. It was a tremendously fast attack. Perhaps most people would have been unable to perceive it properly, including my current self.　</p>
<p>Eh? She was really dangerous… I had doubted my own eyes due to her attack just now. But both her sword and mine were broken.　</p>
<p>E-eeh… wasn’t that a little overkill? Didn’t we have to return the swords back? To destroy things we borrowed from others… Well, I guess that was good for a fantasy themed performance and it looked cool… I would like to be able to do that someday as well!　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Just as I thought that…　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Alright, that’s it… that’s the end of the exam. Everyone passed. You may go home once you return the wooden swords. An owl will be sent to contact you later.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>What to do… I didn’t even show anything good even once… damn it…　</p>
<p>The people around were laughing at me. However, this was the plot where the protagonist starts out as a failure and eventually grows into a hero. That kind of development was quite common after all. So I had to take a step back here and train even more!　</p>
<p>As I thought of that, Arthur approached me.　</p>
<p>“Thank you… I learned something new.”　</p>
<p>“…I will defeat you next time.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>What did she mean by she learned something? As expected from a rival character with a horrible personality I guess.　</p>
<p>I parted with such sharp remarks and left the place. Damn it, I’ll remember this, Arthur. You will definitely pay for the humiliation I got today.　</p>
<p>A rival character with a horrible personality was only strong at the beginning!!　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Ah, what should I do about the wooden sword?　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>◆◆</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It was a surprise to the girl named Arthur because she thought a person with a noble-like disposition such as Fay would have a considerable level of swordsmanship. She couldn’t help but tilt her head in wonder once she shunted Fay’s sword away when he rushed at her.　</p>
<p>Fay’s swordsmanship wasn’t good, to put it kindly. It was so poor, it couldn’t be considered as a particular school’s style or even as self-taught sword art. Arthur couldn’t help but be disappointed by that.　</p>
<p><em>He is not strong at all… his swordsmanship is terrible… Even though he had such amazing mental fortitude and insight, how is this possible?</em></p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>I’ll feel bad if I hit his body, so let’s just knock his sword away.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Uh-n, it’s a really weird way to wield a sword… anyone could do better if they knew the basics…　</em></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>As questions piled up, Arthur asked him directly.　</p>
<p><em>Err, why do you swing your sword so oddly, should I ask him that way? Ah- err, uhm… If I try to be concise then…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“…Why is it {your sword hold} so ugly {even though you have amazing mental strength}?”　</p>
<p>“…What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean it literally though…?”</p>
<p>“Whatever. Let’s continue.”　</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>He won’t tell me… but we aren’t close yet, so it can’t be helped.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>After that, Arthur kept disarming his sword. He wasn’t strong, and his skill level was below hers. However… he kept rushing at her.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>He doesn’t give up…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>At first, Arthur thought he was hiding his skill. But that wasn’t the case as she could feel the force from his sword increasing. It was her first time seeing such an unbalanced swordsman.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>He immediately retrieved his sword. Regardless of how many times she disarmed him, he kept picking it up again. She could feel that Fay was getting stronger each time it happened.　</p>
<p>She kept her eyes on him. Unable to look away because Arthur felt like she would lose if she did. That was how she felt.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Ehehehe”</p>
<p>“What’s with that?”</p>
<p>“How weak… he can’t even use <em>art</em>?”</p>
<span id="easy-footnote-1-19881" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-19881" title="T/N: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Meiryo;color:#202020;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;art&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:11.5pt;font-family:Meiryo;color:#202020;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt; here is written with kanji star and source."><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Art</em> was a necessary concept to enact a paranormal phenomenon and was also commonly known as magic, everyone has it.　</p>
<p>But for Arthur, that thing didn’t matter in the struggle that took place in front of her eyes.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Because he has something more important, that fundamental strength…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Even as people laughed at him, he paid no regard and kept charging. Arthur felt as though she saw the true power and appearance of a warrior there.　</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p><em>…Why are they laughing? There’s nothing funny here…</em>　</p>
<p>Even if the person with true hero potential (Fay) didn’t mind, the person with fake hero potential (Arthur) couldn’t help but be annoyed by the voices around them. After all, he was an important figure that fascinated her.<span id="easy-footnote-2-19881" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-19881" title="T/N: Shin(Nise) no Eiyuu no utsuwa. Utsuwa refers to a vessel, container, which I translated as a person with potential. Also, while the story didn’t reach that far yet, this might be a hint that Arthur was engineered to be that way, thus referring to herself as a fake, unlike Fay who showed such a heroic figure naturally(at least from her perspective)."><sup>2</sup></a></span>　</p>
<p>As such a figure was being laughed at, she couldn’t help but feel strong indignation for him. To her, his appearance was that of a hero. Regardless of how many times it took, they would keep persevering and keep going.　</p>
<p>She felt as if she was reading a page (fragment) of a heroic epic.　</p>
<p>—Reality was ruthless. This world was cruel.　</p>
<p>She was aware of that. Strength was everything, no matter where you were. And mental fortitude was important. However, be it simple power, violence, vile experimentations, the Abyss, or a great criminal, they were all eating away at good people. It was truly an ugly world.　</p>
<p>Power was everything. One could do anything if they had power. Everything was decided with power.　</p>
<p>She wished for such cruel reality (Arthur) to be broken down by the beautiful ideal (Fay).　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t possible. While the honest, good, and hardworking youth (Fay) was to be rewarded, the world just didn&#8217;t work that way. The ideal (Fay) and reality (cruelty that laughed at ideals) stood before her.</p>
<p>She didn’t wish for such a beautiful ideal to be denied. She had finally seen the most precious and ideal figure for her.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“…Let’s just end it here… I can’t stand seeing it {your wonderful figure be laughed at by the people around us} anymore, the {ideal} thing that Fay showed me.”　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She loosened her arms. Then, she poured her<em> art </em>into her violet, left eye. Her violet eye gave out a suspicious glow. It was the <strong>magic eye.　</strong></p><div class="watas-365ad3d1d607b1b837acea484c38482e watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-365ad3d1d607b1b837acea484c38482e"></div>
<p>A magic eye refers to an eye which holds a special power. It was something that could only be awakened if one possessed innate talent for it.　</p>
<p>Her right eye was the magic eye of domination. By consuming<em> art</em>, she could control people with her eye. The ideal (Fay) met the reality (Arthur). There was no way for Fay, who couldn’t even use<em> art</em>, to come out victorious.　</p>
<p>The match was over.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>…Shame… for it to have ended like this… </em><strong><em>go to sleep.</em></strong><strong>　</strong></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The ideal collapsed.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Indeed, she saw it that way… she totally stopped focusing and relaxed her combat stance, her form was completely loose…　</p>
<p>And just before it happened…　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Every little part of her body screeched in alarm.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 004 – I am the Protagonist, Regardless of What Others Say [B]</h2>
<p>—DeathDeathDeathDeathDeathDeathDeathDeathDeathDeathDeath.</p>
<p>She completely adjusted into a combat stance (switched on). Before her was the ideal (Fay) still swinging his wooden sword, on the verge of hitting her at any moment. It was why she doubted her own eyes and was unable to hide her surprise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>—How?!</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The magic eye of domination allowed the user to forcibly control the person they looked into the eyes of. Simply said, it was a type of <strong>suggestion magic.　</strong></p>
<p>At first glance, this seemed to be a royal straight flush as it was pretty powerful and allowed the user to win the moment they used it.　</p>
<p>However, nothing was perfect. Everything had their weaknesses, risks, and countermeasures.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>First, if the opponent was also a carrier of a magic eye it could respond to another magic eye. As these words would literally suggest, an eye for an eye. However, this depended on the compatibility of the respective magic eyes.　</p>
<p>Second, if the opponent had some sort of resistance to the eye. Some people would build up resistance if they were frequently exposed to a magic eye; or if they already possessed that kind of resistance naturally; or if the opponent carried special equipment to resist it.</p>
<p>Third, as long as the opponent didn’t meet eyes with the magic eye users there would be no problem.　</p>
<p>And fourth, <strong>if the opponent was already affected by a suggestion that was greater than what the magic eye could do to them.　</strong></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>A magic eye was all about suggestion. The magic eye that Arthur had was of the greatest class. If she used such an eye to affect others, even normal knights would yield in no time.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>However, the boy named Fay was <strong>perpetually under the suggestion that he was the protagonist</strong>. For the two years since he had first entered this world, he gave that suggestion to himself every single day.　</p>
<p>He had fully assumed that he (Fay) was the protagonist because he was the character that ranked first, not knowing that the ranking was made in collusion with people in a thread and that the goddess had deceived him. He kept such a belief for two years.</p>
<p>That constant self-suggestion had risen into a suggestion powerful enough to defend against the effects of the magic eye. Ironically, his skill in swords and magic didn’t improve at all during those periods.　</p>
<p>This was because Maria, who worried about his behavior, had hidden the instruction manual regarding proper swordsmanship and magic away from him.　</p>
<p>However, that was a trivial matter because right at this moment, Fay’s sword was quickly approaching Arthur’s neck. She was definitely caught off guard to have let his sword reach that point.　</p>
<p>The short distance left made talent, swordsmanship, and skill no longer matter. The abnormal person named Fay managed to land a hit on Arthur… or at least, that was how it was supposed to be.　</p>
<p>Ironically enough, Arthur was also an abnormal person. So she used magic to reinforce her physique and wooden sword, then made full use of her muscles to slash extremely fast. It was literally an all-out attack.</p>
<p>It was a single attack she created in a hurry as the emergency escape from the situation. That attack was acted out of instinct and allowed her to break Fay’s sword (Death’s Scythe) to secure her own life. 　</p>
<p>As a result, Fay’s sword… flew into the air.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Both of them lost their wooden swords. Fay lost his due to Arthur’s slash, while Arthur lost hers because she had forcefully reinforced it.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>…No way. I… </em><strong><em>was forced to go all out.</em></strong><strong>　</strong></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She felt lost about the miracle that just happened in front of her. Arthur was clearly stronger than him but even so, she was forced to go all out.　</p>
<p>It wasn’t like she did it on purpose either. The knight in front of her made her do so forcefully. There was a clear difference in achievement between the two.　</p>
<p>And Fay managed to achieve the latter, against a superior opponent.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Amazing, amazing amazing amazing amazing!!! Even I have no idea how it ended up like that!!</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It was a storm of emotions close to bewilderment. Arthur felt her heart uplift. The ideal managed to win against reality. No, it devoured it. Although it would be evaluated as a draw, she wasn’t in a state to care.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>It’s surprising! To think that there is such a thing! Power is not represented by one’s flesh and magic alone!! Mental fortitude… I need to improve on that as well… I wonder if he is willing to become my master…? </em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Arthur was so excited, however, the boy in front of her was clenching his fist in regret.　</p>
<p><em>…Even though he achieved that much… Just how far is your limit…?</em>　</p>
<p>For the time being, he was the embodiment of her ideals. So she decided to thank him for allowing her to find a new challenge.　</p>
<p>“Thank you… I learned something new.”　</p>
<p>“…I will defeat you next time.”</p>
<p>Fay merely said that then left. Arthur kept chasing his back until she couldn’t see it anymore.　</p>
<p><em>‘I will defeat you next time’ … that means we will meet again, right?　</em></p>
<p><em>See you later… Fay.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>In her heart, she vowed to meet him again.　</p>
<p><em>Ah, what should I do about the sword?</em>　</p>
<p>She finally returned to herself and pondered on what to do with the wooden swords she broke.　</p>
<p><em>If I go and apologize together with Fay… Ah, Fay already went home… Muu, you forced me to deal with it alone.</em>　</p>
<p>She puffed her cheeks for a bit. Even though there wouldn’t be any problems if they just went to apologize together. As she was wondering what to do, somebody talked to her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Um.”　</p>
<p>“Hm…?”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>As Arthur directed her gaze around, she saw blond hair similar to her own and a pair of blue eyes. It was a boy with a symmetrical face.　</p>
<p>“Err…”　</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m Tlue. Err, I have something I want to tell you.”</p>
<p>“I see… what is it?”</p>
<p>“That person, it’s about the boy named Fay who paired up with you just now.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know.”</p>
<p>“I know it’s sudden, but it’s better to not get involved with him…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Since she was suddenly told that, it felt like her ideal was being denied and that made her feel bad.　</p>
<p>“He’s dangerous. Although I don’t know why, he feels dangerous.”　</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p><em>I think you are the more dangerous person though</em>…</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Tlue was a good boy. Being the protagonist of Round Table Heroes, he had no ill intentions behind his actions. He simply wanted to let her know of his strange and dangerous experience with Fay.　</p>
<p>Looking at the previous exchanges between Arthur and Fay, Tlue felt a slight risk that she might try and get involved with Fay. That was all there was to it.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>However, the fear engraved within the boy named Tlue made him mistakenly approach Arthur. No matter how one tries to think, there would be no way the situation between them would improve when Tlue said it in that manner.　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“A-anyway that person is a monster. So much so he could easily cross the ethical line.”　</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>His mental fortitude sure is abnormal, but I don’t think it is something to be feared. Does this person have knot holes for eyes…? </em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Hm…alright. I’ll remember your words {but I didn’t say I won’t get involved with him}.”　</p>
<p>“I-I see.”</p>
<p>“Can I also ask one thing?”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“What kind of swordsmanship style does Fay use?”</p><div class="watas-7de920b318caf4e1ab68107eca59ffb6 watas-bottom-vi" id="watas-7de920b318caf4e1ab68107eca59ffb6"></div>
<p>“…He is a self-taught swordsman. Nobody taught him. He also didn’t mix well with the orphanage, no, I guess creepy is the more appropriate word…”</p>
<p>“…I see. That’s all, thanks.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>I see, so that’s why his swordsmanship is so ugly… and he also didn’t get along with the rest of the orphanage… yet he still aims to better himself, so it ended up into a weird swordsmanship style…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>I’m convinced now. That was the reason for his mental fortitude. Even though nothing seems to go well for him, he piles up his efforts every day and it becomes like that.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>And I’m also the same… all alone. To think that a fellow child in the same orphanage as him would speak about him that way.</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Fay… when we meet again, let’s become friends…</em>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She was lost in thought. Tlue was looking worriedly at her, and the examiner knight Marumaru squinted at them.</p>
