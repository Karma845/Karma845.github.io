<h3>Chapter 9: Falma De Medicis: The Alchemist</h3>


<p class="calibre1">“Is the adopted baby by the Bonnefoy family that has the ability to learn lightning magic doing well?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">During the time of regular medical examinations at the court, the Empress inquires about Sophie’s current conditions with Falma. Her demeanor becomes worrisome, since the Empress is also a mother of one child, and she happens to like children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, and I’m handling her lightning strikes well today. The electric shocks feel good when you get used to it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ones who are being trained are Falma and Ellen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fuhaha, she’s a promising mythical messenger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, there is no concern for Sophie in being kidnapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The kidnapper will surely get an electric shock as soon as she cries, and the discharge can be seen around her based on her emotion. It’s quite flashy, so there’s nothing that can get closer to her (without suffering the shock). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want to quickly make some arrangements for her, so I want her to grow up sooner…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma gives a dry laugh towards the Empress’s impatience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please wait at least ten more years for her to serve as Your Majesty’s servant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Umu, tell Eleonor to bring Sophie next time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sophie is a newborn infant who has been noticed by the Empress of the Great Empire, coming from the background of a shabby abandoned child. The Empress may have an inkling that Sophie is a lightning Divine Art user, but Falma desires for her to have a normal childhood. Because the infant has a rare attribute called the non-attribute, Falma feels responsible as he was the person who opened her divine vein which is </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">deemed unusual under normal circumstances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By the way, her electric shock is not only for attacking, but it’s for saving lives!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  the  Empress  ordered  a  combative  education  as  a  special  gift  for  Sophie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma, who believes it is an irresistible gift to be granted, publicizes Sophie’s ability that can be regulated for common usages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Haha, as expected, you’re over-selling her abilities. What can a baby do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That is…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma starts his explanation. About a week ago, an old commoner fell down near the pharmacy. Falma was rushed to the citizen, but the commoner had already suffered a myocardial  arrest[1]  and  suffered  an  irregular  heartbeat,  as  the  [Diagnostic  Eye] </p>
<p class="calibre1">displayed red[2] to which the commoner’s symptom could not be treated. During the time when everyone was giving up on saving his life, Ellen was carrying Sophie nearby, so Falma thoughtful y lowered Sophie onto the commoner, then placed her little hands and feet at specific locations on his chest[3]. Tickle tickle! Falma tickled her armpit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then Sophie, while clueless, was delighted from the tickling and expelled electrical shock as the commoner was instantly defibrillated, and resumed normal breathing after his heart restarted from cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It was an instant AED </p>
<p class="calibre1">(automated external defibrillator)… Pharma was pleasantly surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did you say? You managed to rejuvenate a human whose heart has stopped?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Empress becomes overly excited after hearing the retelling of the story that she nearly slips off her throne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve never heard of such a usage from divine art user!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Strictly speaking, this did not mean that ‘the heart has stopped’. It should have been said  that  it  was not  the  heart  itself that  stopped,  but  rather  the  heart  suffered  an abnormal heartbeat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma corrects the details to prevent the Empress’s misunderstanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a difference between asystole (when the heart completely stops) and cardiac (when  the  heartbeats  become  irregular)  arrests,  and  Sophie’s  electric  shock  was </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">effective during that cardiac arrest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes I hear you, but I don’t know why you say that with such a tiny subtle difference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tell me why this happened!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Empress Elizabeth II is a short-tempered woman. There’s no need for any explanation greater than thirty seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All the muscles of our bodies are driven by electrical signals. If an electric current is applied, the signals of the heart may be adjusted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hmm… the Empress falls into deep thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This cannot be allowed as acceptable, especially those who have been judged to be ordinary people even when they were from the aristocratic background and did not have divine connections. Because they were non-attributed divine art users, they were overlooked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon, as he listens to the rebuking words of the Empress with the court officials in the Empress’s office, withers.[4] </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it’s not a big issue. It’s difficult to identify non-attribute divine art users. If none of the main attributes do not open properly, it may be overlooked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If this is so, it had been a great loss to the Empire to keep the non-attribute mythical gods dormant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s really true.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon agrees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Falma, can you identify the non-attribute gods?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I can only see the divine veins, but I’m unable to identify the gods.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma has a premonition that his workload is about to increase further on top of his pharmacology practices. Even so, Falma did not hesitate to work together to restore the forgottens’ honors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you can see the divine vein, why can’t you see the god?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s finish this topic first. Please ask Salomon-san for the rest of the details about the detection of the god later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Empress devises her plan and secretly gathers the aristocratic commoners from all over the empire. There are a total of more than 300 commoners who are invited to the palace at different times, but Falma only discovers that five of them are non-attribute divine art users, and proceeds to open their divine veins on the spot as he demonstrates his unique skill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma is able to open the dormant divine veins, but it is neither possible for Solomon to  identify  the  types  of  non-attribute  divine  art  during  his  assessments,  nor  the connections to the divine arts of various extremely rare unidentified gods of merchant, music, time, travel, agricultural, etc. have not surfaced for the past few hundred years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A person with a very rare guardian deity that has not been seen since over a hundred years is now finally found. The forgotten aristocratic commoners, from the age range of  fifteen to forty-eight, were all abandoned by  their parents  and entrusted to the orphanages related to the great temple and suffered difficult lifestyles. The Empress declares her finding directly to her subjects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve searched, and I’ve found unexpected treasures.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Empress is mortified as a result. In her eyes, a good divine art user is the property of the Empire. By placing the right materials in the right places, the gains of the excellent results can be expected in the field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, it’s painful to receive such a report because I’m indirectly responsible for the priest’s  impaired  ability  to  discover  the  dormant  divine  veins.  But  if  the  religious countries know about this…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon is anxious that the priests of the Imperial City temple are not able to utilize this information. If Falma is the only one who can unearth the divine veins of non-attribute gods and open them, the great temples will increasingly target Falma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have to act unpretentious. How much does the Empire really benefit from that boy?” (Empress) </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you for recognizing him. Falma’s plans for rehabilitation are not limited to the Empire.” (Solomon) </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma not only believes that it’s fine to have his place of residence be comfortable, but he is considerate of other country’s well-being as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, if that’s what he desires.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Empress acknowledges Falma’s eagerness is for the best. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I really want you to remain collected during this time.” (Salomon) The  Empress  orders  the  strengthening  the  security  for  the  de  Medicis  family.  She deploys the Imperial Citizen’s Holy Knights and have them disguised as passerbys (to protect the de Medicis members), inquires into the matters of the pharmacy and about any suspicious person who attempts to sneak into the de Medicis family, then captures and interrogates the culprits without letting the de Medicis family notices. She also sends the Holy Knights beyond the empire’s borders for obtaining information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, Bruno also increases the number of Holy Knights to guard the mansion and the university, as well as strengthens night patrols to prevent harm to his family and servants.  Of  the  few  bureau  connections  that  Bruno  has  in  place,  he  cooperates particularly closely with the Marseil e territories (to increase their securities). Because of  the  far-reaching  influences  of  the  Empress  and  Bruno,  Falma  is  able  to  live  an ordinary life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Falma-san, good evening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre, the head of the dispensers for Pharmacy Guild, has arrived at a Different World Pharmacy with his daughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre, the owner of the Apricum per Foliis Pharmacy, regularly pulls his wagon to buy medicines at the Falma’s pharmacy. He commonly purchases them all at one time and distributes the  contents  to each pharmacy guild  member’s  dispensing  store,  while providing  them  with  proper  medication  and  prescription  guidances.  In  Japan,  the stores handle a wide variety of over-the-counter medicines, such as cold medicines and antipyretics, that can be sold without a pharmacist, along with daily health foods, oral care products, and various sanitary products. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s you. Greetings.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, you are…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Pharma replies, Pierre’s daughter comes out from behind Pierre and gives a courteous bow. She shyly looks at Falma. According to Pierre, she has mixed feelings about Falma since she was given a suppository by Falma when she had the flu. Falma recalls what he had done to her during that time, but he doesn’t understand why she is blushing because he had only given her medication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um, do you care for candy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Falma asks, he pulls a bottle of candy, and she quickly hides behind Pierre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lotte, if you are free, take a break and eat some snacks with this child on the third floor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, is that okay with you? Can I really? By all means !?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, by all means.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ye-s!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lotte  skips  along  and  goes  to  get  a  tea  set…  Falma  thinks  she  probably  baked  an orange cake earlier today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s thing going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma sometimes appeared at regular meetings held at the Pharmacy Guild’s dispensary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is trying hands off, basically shoves off, the management of the Pharmacy Guild to Pierre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Every store has rising sales. There are high demands for sanitary products, diapers, and underwear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It sounds good. Place a female pharmacist in the store that handles sanitary products.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since sanitary products sales is a delicate issue, it would be difficult for male pharmacists to sell (especially to women). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I was told to hire a female pharmacist. And when it comes to diapers, there have been a lot of demands by the young knights.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">When wearing armor, it is especial y useful because the armor cannot be easily removed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perrie indicates that the diapers made of cotton are sold very fast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Haha… I’m surprised to hear that. They are not intended to be used for long-term care. Please remind them not to wear the diapers for a long period, since it will hinder proper hygiene.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  that,  Falma  receives  favorable  reports  of  businesses  that  are  successful.  The Pharmacy Guild’s dispensaries are in good shape in recent days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The number of registered pharmacists to the Pharmacy Guild has also increased, and all  member’s  stores  are  performing  well.  By  lowering  the  drug’s  prices,  they  have cultivated the potential demands by imperial citizens. The Pharmacy Guild’s dispensary stores adhere to the prescription rules properly and are less likely to cause problems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is largely due to the agreements that the drugs cannot be obtained anywhere else other than purchasing from the Different World Pharmacy or Falma’s factory. It can be problematic if Pierre and Falma moods become foul, resulting in the members being forced to leave the guild. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  Pharmacy  Guild  seems  to  be  doing  well.  How  about  the  Pharmacology  Guild stores?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The number of customers is so poor. At first, I thought the number was sufficient, but when there is a difference in number in comparison to ours…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Pharmacology Guild, where Beron was once the pharmacologist guild’s chief, had most of its members absorbed by the newly launched Pharmacy Guild established by Falma. Although most members have been absorbed by the Pharmacy Guild’s dispensary, there are stil  remnant details about the Pharmacology Guild’s new leadership. However, the handling of dangerous and toxic medicines has been abolished by the Empress’s decree, so the base medicines that can be procured are from herbs, potions, mushrooms, dried animals and plants as crude medicines[5]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that so…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma feels sorry to hear such news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are still some citizens who love traditional medicines, but I wonder if it will be difficult to survive in the Imperial City at this rate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen sympathizes with Perrier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please provide financial and technical assistance to the pharmacology dispensaries that are having a hard time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pharmacy  Guild’s  dispensary  provides  modern  medicine  and  health  goods,  and Pharmacology  Guild  uses  traditional  medicines.  Now  the  Pharmacology  Guild’s members are a few  remnants of their past. They have little  successes because  the Pharmacy Guild has taken most of the patients. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hah? Well, if that’s what you want Falma, I’ll do that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doing this is like rubbing salt on the enemy’s wounds, according to Pierre’s perspective, where he doesn’t expect the gap in sales to be closer to each other any time soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They also have their livelihood. If their management fails, please tell them to come to me for a discussion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma doesn’t want to crush the Pharmacology Guild either, rather he just to prevent the members from selling bad and suspicious medicines to the common people at high prices. The Pharmacology Guild executives that turned hostile towards Falma in the past quietly left the organization. The pharmacology store owners who visit the Different World  Pharmacy,  Falma  provides  detailed  information  on  the  efficacy  of  herbal medicines and the related herbs, along with the education of the recipes that can be effectively be used daily in the preparation of medicinal teas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There  were  times…  where  an  alchemist  of  pharmacology  belonging  to  the Pharmacology Guild suspiciously gathered the alchemists and pharmacologists of the Imperial City.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An alchemist…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alchemy is the natural science of the earth. It can be said that chemistry has developed through the enormous trials and errors of the alchemists. Many compounds have been discovered by alchemists and applied to drug’s discoveries. This is a good compatibility with the current pharmacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Bruno appears to have negative doubts about alchemy, and alchemy-related books are not available on the bookshelves at Falma’s residence. Therefore, it is almost likely the reason that this was the first word for Falma to recognize. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alchemists, uh… the ultimate goal is to get gold out of base metals. What are they usually doing at the gatherings?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma wonders where their research funding came from. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because it is a profession that doesn’t generate much business, there aren’t many alchemists themselves. Usually, they make a living by synthesizing compounds. They sel  them to pharmacologists and alchemists also serve as pharmacologists themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the ultimate goal for alchemists is for humans to be immortal and to synthesize gold.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It  is  said  that  if  one  has  a  Philosopher’s  Stone,  one  can  obtain  the  ultimate  goal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the master alchemist denied its existence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen pinches Falma’s mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your father, Count Bruno de Medicis, published a famous paper seven years ago that the Philosopher’s Stone cannot be synthesized to the domestic and foreign pharmacologists and alchemists. He was desperate in discovering methods for the synthesis of gold, but the master alchemist said he could not synthesize the Philosopher’s Stone. “ </p>
<p class="calibre1">(There is a concept of the philosopher’s stone in this world…) While listening to Bruno’s past achievements, Falma is deeply moved by the phrase </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Philosopher’s Stone”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rumors that Philosopher’s Stone can be used to make elixirs of immortality and has the ability to catalyze gold. It is a grand vision for medicine in the medical field with such power. Of course, it was also a legend on earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It even said to have succeeded in the creation of a homunculus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">(In such an event, along with the alchemist’s soul of eagerness, the homunculus word appears to have surfaced among the successes.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Homunculus is believed to be an android dwarf made by an alchemist in a distillation bottle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who saw it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma suspects that if there is such a thing, he definitely likes to see it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it’s said to have taken more than 40 weeks to create a homunculus. It was mentioned that they were exhibiting what they’ve already made. Perhaps they put the corpse of a human fetus in a glass container and caused the appearance of movement. I think it was merely a show and they were paying for it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The onlookers  were unaware that they  were scammed, Pierre concludes with  this statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is being malicious… but was it really a complete scam? What is the purpose of doing so? It was called the Philosopher’s Stone, and even a declared as a homunculus, yet nothing was being called out as a scam.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen is troubled while removing her glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Majority of the time, life doesn’t grow in a glass bottle. Falma believes it so too, right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen inquires for a confirmation, and Falma senses he’s heading for trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Theoretically, it’s not impossible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please repeat that again, because I don’t understand…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">(The fertilized eggs grow outside the body within the blastocyst [after the amniotic sac develops], but he is about to discuss reproductive engineering, which will be a long very discussion.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  the  subject  is  a  specialty  of  Falma,  but  since  the  story  becomes  too complicated, he keeps his mouth shut. The fertilized egg can grow up to the stage of blastocyst without a placenta, and with an artificial placenta, it is theoretical y possible to grow a fetus outside the body; research and development is quite advanced on the Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It seems that the alchemist that gathered the other alchemists around Imperial City held a weekly gathering. About 10% of the previous pharmacologists are also alchemists, and these pharmacologists are still devoted to the field of alchemy studies. Oh, by the way, I happen to be an alchemist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre boasts about himself as he displays his alchemist badge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What were you doing at that meeting?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanted to see the alchemist’s demonstration of the Philosopher’s Stone that led to the success in alchemy. After that demonstration, he displayed the homunculus, then he sold his discovered mysteries at such high prices that the pharmacologists  and alchemists would go bankrupt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wonder if anyone else had succeeded in selling the technology. If there were many people who failed, it would likely be noticed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen frowns with a distorted face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was the reason for it becoming successful with so many people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With just through demonstrations?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen suspects there is a possibility. One of the successful people is probably Sakura. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you know where the meeting will be held?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A picture is worth a thousand words, so Falma is interested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes I do. I’ve checked it out, but only alchemists and their disciples can attend the meeting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If that’s so, why don’t you acknowledge that I’m the disciple of the alchemist Pierre and let me go with you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t it dangerous? Falma-san’s name is known throughout the Imperial City, probably also in appearance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can disguise myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma proclaims without any concerns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m worried for Falma and Pierre. I’ll attend with you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Eleonor’s name is also known throughout the Imperial City.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen is unaware of her position as the most dignified and respected disciple of the Court Pharmacologist, Bruno. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then how about I will dress as a man and Falma as a woman? That way we will not get caught.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen is going to become a cross-dresser. Since she is usually required to behave as a noble, she yearns to cosplay as a beautiful man in appearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even if you want to do that, why don’t you just cover yourself with a hood?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She wants to pity Falma, who doesn’t fancy a hobby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I’m going to go incognito, I want to do it perfectly and dress up as a man! Falma can dress as a woman!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can do it if you like, Ellen. I’m definitely not dressing up as a woman.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, Falma and Ellen strategize to infiltrate the suspicious alchemist’s gathering with Pierre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By the way, what will you do when you finally sneak in?” Pierre asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I uncover the alchemy’s gimmicks, I can ban them from the industry. I’ll show you how.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If there is circumstantial evidence of them being a scammer, they won’t be able to do business. But as the alchemist’s gathering is getting bigger each time, there’s something worth about the field to believe in again. I heard that they  synthesized  gold using mercury and sulfur. Do you have a chance to expose that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it appropriate to use mercury for synthesizing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen doubts her hearing. Cedric and other pharmacists that are working hard at the pharmacy decide to eavesdrop. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“With  alchemy, it is possible to synthesize  gold.  However,  since gold is an atom, it cannot be made into a compound. Mercury, that is, is an atom with atomic number 80. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By irradiating the nucleus to disintegrate the atomic nuclei and strip off the protons, it will eventually yield gold as an atom with atomic number 79.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eh?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What!? Doesn’t it mean that under alchemy, it is impossible?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen and Pierre stand up from their chairs and shout out. Ellen hastily grabs Falma while she drops her glasses and nearly step on them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You drop it again! Stop dropping your glasses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma suspects that he has made too many promises and is still doing it on purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He thinks it’s better to make plastic glasses so that Ellen can’t break them. Lotte and Pierre’s daughter, as they are having a tea party upstairs, come down from the third floor because they hear loud shouts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, nothing. Continue on with your tea party.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma  dismissively  waves  his  hands  to  them.  Lotte  embarrassedly  wipes  the  cake powder around her mouth and goes back to the third floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Both of you need to stay calm. At this moment, it’s impossible for the technology in this world and it requires a huge amount of energy for the process.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no reason that gold cannot be synthesized, but there only are few gold atoms that  can  be  formed  in  a  single  reaction,  so  it  could  be  said  that  it  would  even  be unrealistic  to  synthesize  one  teaspoonful  of  gold  with  modern  Earth  science  and technology. It would take a huge amount of power, time and budget. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I was surprised. I wondered if Falma can synthesize gold with divine power.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellen calmly sits down and wears her glasses again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even if I try to use my divine power to convert mercury, it’s probably impossible due to my lack of energy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Haha, if only I can do that. If so, I can create huge profit, after having you teach me the secret technique.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre jokes and laughs heartily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hahaha… I surely can’t do that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma has cold sweat while laughing with Pierre, because he remembers something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Oh, no, I can synthesize gold by using material creation) Falma, who has the power to create al  substances with the ability [Substance Creation] </p>
<p class="calibre1">on his left hand, is able to synthesize not only gold but also all metals and jewelries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even so, he has abundant amount of capital from the profits generated at the Different World Pharmacy, so he doesn’t have to think about gold creation as he current has no need for money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(…I believe I’m an alchemist if I use that logic.) In a sense, Falma is the only one in the world who can be called a true alchemist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No — I’m looking forward to studying alchemy. How do you perform alchemy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Falma displays a fearless smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You look like an evil alchemist, Falma-san.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As she’s looking at his expression, Ellen is fearful of his enthusiasm in becoming an evil alchemist. </p>
