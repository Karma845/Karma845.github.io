<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; Another Batch of Slaves</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I arrived at the backyard, I found Tendo and the other five heroes, as well as Finne, Kusel, and Iris, taking a break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Ephyr and Asha are servants of the mansion, it seems that they are supporting the others without participating in the training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well done, Tendo. I just want to quickly confirm with you again, what are your plans?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, Tendo and the others had been training at my mansion for the past two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, the thing is&#8230;I&#8217;m thinking of going to ask the knights of the royal castle to train me&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. In that case we should head to the castle later then. I&#8217;m going to check out the store today, so can we go after?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, that would be great&#8230;also, if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;d like to ask you to spar with me for a bit? I want to see how strong I&#8217;ve become since the labyrinth!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m curious about too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking around, I saw that not only the heroes, but also Finne and the others had a twinkle in their eyes as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right. So I guess my work is cut out with the first thing today being to check out the store, then briefly stop by Bohbee’s, and then to the castle. The spar will have to wait till another time, okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said this, all but one of them agreed with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;That person was Ephyr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s the matter, Ephyr?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Umm&#8230;can I stay back? I&#8217;m still a little afraid to go into that store&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that&#8217;s understandable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. Then, have a good day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, we’re off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I headed for the preliminary inspection together with Finne, Tendo and the others. While I was driving the carriage, something occurred to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Come to think of it, Tendo, you and your party didn&#8217;t say anything about going to Bohbee’s store this time, is everything all right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These guys didn&#8217;t go with us on our last slave purchase because they couldn&#8217;t accept the concept of slavery itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Yeah, we’re fine.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-95501807' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-95501807' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, may I ask why the sudden change?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked, and Tendo answered slowly, as if searching for words within himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have come to understand that it’s better to face these things and experience them personally, rather than avert my eyes from them. This world is different after all, and I have to accept that. Besides, I now know that buying slaves, like you did this time around, can also be some kind of salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mogami nodded and opened his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right. As a hero, I think it’s only proper that we see with our own eyes how slaves are treated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shinonome then continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must not turn our eyes away. We’ve all experienced how little value is placed on human life in this world. Yet, we still find it difficult to take another’s life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others looked down upon hearing her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shinonome is right, human life is indeed insignificant in this world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned that when I almost got killed. That&#8217;s why I have also made up my mind to kill anyone who tries to kill me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asakura opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are heroes after all. I don&#8217;t want to abandon lives that could have been saved right before my eyes!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asakura has a cheerful personality and was not the type to stand idly by and watch someone else get hurt, even back on Earth. Being who she is, her desire to help is probably stronger than anyone else&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuno turned to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have a hard time seeing Haruto kill without batting an eye. But you had a good reason and told me about it. Even back then when I heard that you actually bought Ephyr as a slave, I was very surprised, but you had a good reason.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remembered that all five of them were surprised when I told them about Ephyr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And Haruto helped Ephyr to the very end. If we had met Ephyr first, I don&#8217;t think we would have been able to help her&#8230;still, I would like for us to help the ones we can with our abilities. To that end, I believe it’s prudent to accept all these things as they are. And I also don’t think it&#8217;s necessarily right to impose our common sense on this world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be almost impossible to change the values of this world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, it is a very heroic way of thinking to want to help as many people as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And to do so, y’all must have been prepared to accept a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we were talking about this, we arrived at our destination, the scheduled site of the Ashtaroth Trading Company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some craftsmen were still working, but they seemed to recognize me and let us through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It probably used to house some big trading company, and the exterior is magnificent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The building itself is quite large&#8230;or rather, it is ridiculously large. Maybe, a little too big, perhaps? It seems that Finne and the others had the same impression.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTEwNDIzNjMwNTIiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since there was little point in observing just the exterior, I went in right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The store is designed with a storefront setup, and once you pass through the door, you will find yourself in an area where products are lined up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a simple partition, and there seems to be another sales space in the back. This space could be used to display high-end products or as a business meeting space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps because of the simple interior design, the space seems larger than it actually is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow, It&#8217;s quite spacious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne muttered as she looked around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, I guess so. We won’t have that much merchandise starting out, so we probably won&#8217;t be using all of the space&#8230;but, then again, Dillan went to the trouble to prepare it for us. So we gotta make sure that the store rises to his expectations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As each of us looked around inside, Kusel spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, there&#8217;s a staircase leading to the basement here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basement?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walked up to Kusel, and just as she said, there was a staircase that led further down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was dimly lit inside, but there was a magic tool for lighting, so I activated it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arriving down, we found several rooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This place could probably serve as the base for manufacturing our goods or as a warehouse.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was another room upstairs that could be used for storage, but it would be really handy if the basement could be used as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After checking out all the facilities, we returned upstairs and went out to the backyard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It too was reasonably spacious, and in the corner was a shed with a small chimney.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is this? A warehouse?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we approached, we found out what it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A blacksmith’s&#8230;workshop?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris answered my question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe my dad is also aware that Haruto makes his own weapons, so he was probably looking for a property with a blacksmith’s workshop, maybe?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. So might as well make it here&#8230;however.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I utilize a skill to make weapons, so I don&#8217;t exactly need a workshop per se.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I guess it could serve as a camouflage to make it look like I&#8217;m making them here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am currently the only one who can make weapons and armor, but it might be a good idea to have craftsmen make and sell weapons here while I’m gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which means I will need some craftsmen&#8230;in other words, Dwarves? I heard that there is a Dwarven Country past Glicente, maybe I can find some there&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll have to find craftsmen for weapons, so might as well find some for potion craft while at it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, after checking the interior and deciding roughly where to put what, we headed for Bohbee’s store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, when are you launching?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris asked me in the carriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honestly. I would like to open as soon as possible, but we are still in the preparation stage. Bohbee will be joining us in a week or so, and we&#8217;ll be ready to start setting up the interior&#8230;well, we&#8217;re right on schedule, so maybe two more weeks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we talked about this, we arrived at Bohbee’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short time after entering the store, Bohbee came out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is everything all right, boss?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was just checking out the store and thought I&#8217;d drop by and see you&#8230;how much longer is this going to take?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee put his hand on his chin in thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me see&#8230;I think we&#8217;re on schedule, so maybe another week or so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m glad to hear that. I&#8217;ve got my own staff, and they’re currently being educated on how to serve customers. We have excellent butlers and maids, so everything should fall right into place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess there won&#8217;t be much for me to teach after joining up, then. But, if I may ask, are the staff the only resource we’ve secured? What about the escorts when we need to stock up and security guards for the store? We may have to hire a dedicated escort or an adventurer&#8230;if we consider all these, then the budget.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nah, if my staff keep up the same pace, then they will be strong enough to defeat a C-rank adventurer on their own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wha-!? What in the world did you do to them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee was surprised at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are slaves he sold, which is probably a surprise to him because he knew their capabilities best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I just taught them how to use their powers a little&#8230;so, Bohbee. The point is, we’re just about ready. I feel bad rushing you, but I’m just waiting on you now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No of course not, I will try to join you as soon as possible.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-74116140' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-74116140' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded to Bohbee, who bowed his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Ellis suddenly spoke to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Master. There is a capable individual in this slave trader’s shop.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capable?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Yes. He&#8217;s in the back of this slave trader’s shop.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So you’re saying he’s a commodity?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;That&#8217;s right. I strongly recommend you meet face to face.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand. If Ellis says so, I&#8217;ll see him. Now I’m a little curious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to ask Bohbee to meet this person Ellis mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, I&#8217;m sorry to trouble you again so soon, but do you mind if I take another look at the slaves? It’s that place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh there, sure of course. Would you like to bring your companion with you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee glanced at Finne, Tendo and the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way I said it, he must have understood that I was talking about the room where Ephyr was, and for a moment his face tensed up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Tendo nodded, probably thinking that he had to see it since he was prepared for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. They’ll be coming along.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Iris and Asha next to them were shaking their heads, and it seemed that Finne and Kusel weren’t coming as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right. Then please follow me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee opened the door and stepped in first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, Tendo, Suzuno, Mogami, Shinonome, and Asakura followed Bohbee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were making our way toward the room in question when suddenly I received an instruction from Ellis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Please turn left that way.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm? That&#8217;s a different route from the one I remember.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bohbee. Please take a left there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right&#8230;I guess this will be the first time I show you this way, huh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bohbee did as he was told and turned left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;He should be straight ahead.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were iron cages on both sides, and the slaves inside were looking a little scrawny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, I hadn&#8217;t been down this way before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Excuse me. Do you not treat the ones that are injured?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked what Tendo must have wondered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This room is where we place the new arrivals of our store&#8230;we just haven&#8217;t gotten around to it yet is all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when we proceeded straight to the end of the room, I saw a girl in her teens in a cage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellis, is this her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;That&#8217;s right. She’s the one.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stared at her, and Bohbee looked at the person in the bars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This one just arrived at my store just yesterday&#8230;I have only taken the bare minimum of measures. I apologize for the unsightly appearance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl had long black hair, purple eyes, and no right arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;&lt;Master. Please take a look at her status.&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did as Ellis said and took a look at her status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmmm. I see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if this is the skill you were talking about when you mentioned interesting talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> .</span></p>
<p><b>&lt;Kaito Ranma&gt;</b></p>
<p><b>The more difficult the situation, the more the basic physical ability increases (up to five-fold).</b></p>
<p><b>Skills used for assassination are easier to acquire, and the effect is always doubled.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow, it’s certainly interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is &#8220;the more difficult the situation&#8221; here, based on Noir&#8217;s subjective judgment? Or is it god&#8217;s judgment?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a rather scrupulous skill, but if used right, it could be very powerful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with such a powerful skill, how did Noir become a slave?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Bohbee about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bohbee. Why is she&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Apparently, she used to be a member of Glicente&#8217;s dark side, but she committed some crime and was condemned to slavery&#8230;according to what I heard. She was with a merchant I know in another city, but because of her background, he couldn&#8217;t find a buyer for her, so she was brought here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s the crime?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, the man who sold her to me wouldn&#8217;t tell me anything, and she wouldn&#8217;t open her mouth, so I am also in the dark about it&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, it sounds kinda fishy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, open the door so I can talk to her for a minute. She can’t move anyway, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Bohbee to open the door, then I approached her and crouched down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;What, do you, want&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir was able to barely move her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her expression was weak and her voice feeble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just wanted to ask you a few questions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I have nothing to say to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if you don’t want to, I am still going to ask&#8230;so, you used to be an assassin for Glicente.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;What about it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir frowned at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hear you&#8217;re a former member of Glicente’s Black Ops division&#8230;are you aware of the purge of the royal family in that country?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I am, but what does that have to do with me?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-84831453' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-84831453' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is hopeless, she doesn’t feel like talking at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was struggling, Tendo approached me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto, may I give it a shot? If she’s indeed an ex-Glicente subject, she might feel comfortable talking to me under my title.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm? Oh, I see what you mean.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stood up, and Tendo crouched down in front of Noir as if to replace me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Who the hell are you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am Tendo Koji. I was summoned by Glicente as a hero.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Oh I see, you’re the one. So, what does the great hero of Glicente want with me? I heard that you were the ones who attacked the royal capital.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, the focus of the conversation has changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, won’t she become even more wary of us, at this rate?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s true, but&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To be precise, I was the one who initiated it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I replied, taking over Tendo&#8217;s cue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Noir finally seemed interested in me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;May I, ask, your name?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m Haruto Yuki. An adventurer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. The famous EX-rank&#8230;well, if you were there, then it makes sense that the royal family, with all their clamor about some ridiculous trump card they call Yvel, were purged.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yvels are modified soldiers created by the royal family. The fact that she even knew of their existence suggests that she may have had a very high position in the Black Ops division.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her level is also quite high, damn I really want her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Noir, would you mind if I bought you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You want to buy me, a former member of Glicente&#8217;s Black Ops division?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What if I tried to kill you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You think I&#8217;m that easy of a target that you can kill easily?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s not going to try to kill me, not with that much difference in our abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, I am determined to decipher the magic circle that Glicente used to summon us and create a magic circle for our return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m already working on deciphering it with Ellis’ help, but it will take some time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until the magic circle is completed, I can’t afford to get myself killed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The so-called crime you committed was made up by the royal family, wasn&#8217;t it? Aren&#8217;t you relieved to hear that the royal family has been purged?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir’s eyes widened at my deduction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you’d expect of someone from the dark side, she was trying not to wear her emotions on her face, but she couldn’t get past my discerning eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you say? Just try talking to me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Just you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure. I’ll put up a barrier so no one but you and I can hear anything we say.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then created a barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just deployed a barrier. Now no one can hear us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Seems like you really did erect a barrier.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Noir closed her eyes once and made a gesture of one in deep thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Okay. I had my doubts when I heard that you led the purge of the royal family, but if you are capable of putting up a barrier of this magnitude, I need no more convincing. And even if I stay silent, I might end up being made to divulge everything against my will anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir said, as if giving up everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if, I&#8217;m not going to force you to say anything you don’t want to say&#8230;although, it would be nice if you are willing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for understanding. Are you fine with the barrier then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, it’s fine. So you want me to tell you what happened to me, correct?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please, by all means.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As you already know, my name is Noir&#8230;where do I begin?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noir prefaced her story with this and began to tell it.</span></p>
