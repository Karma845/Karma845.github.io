<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="chapter-009-those-who-notice-those-who-protect-a">Chapter 009 – Those who Notice, Those who Protect [A]</h2>
<p>There was the sound of a wooden sword being parried. The dull thud of wood striking flesh. A man coughing as he knelt down and held onto the spot he was hit.</p>

<p>Bouran was looking down on such a view and gave a smile of victory. On the contrary, Fay was looking up at her. He didn’t look at her out of disappointment, just looking at the void. His eyes were looking beyond her and far beyond.　</p>
<p>Far and beyond…　</p>


<p>This was repeated over and over. Fay always lost against Bouran, Tlue, and Arthur. He lost completely over and over again.　</p>
<p>Bouran was always winning against Fay.　</p>
<p>She thought this would continue over and over. She also thought their values would never change, which was Bouran (victor) and Fay (loser). This value was overthrown slightly, which served as the prologue and triggered the change in the girl named Bouran.　</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">■◆</p>

<p>Well then, some time passed since I got my one-to-one lesson with Yururu-sensei. It had been about three months since I first enrolled in the knight brigade.　</p>
<p>Indeed, this Fay had undergone certain changes. My swordsmanship was getting sharper. I could now last some time against Arthur and Tlue compared to when I was one-sidedly beaten down, and recently I’ve been able put up a decent fight against Bouran .　</p>

<p>My growth was quite fast, said Yururu-sensei with an indescribable expression. Ah-, I know that, sensei.　</p>
<p>As expected… she just couldn’t hide her surprise, as I had grown stronger at great momentum. And the training regime itself was quite hard so she also worried about my physical condition as instructor. As expected of the master character!　</p>

<p>“Err, well then, let’s have another mock battle.”　</p>
<p>“Aah.”</p>

<p>I crossed swords with sensei many times. As expected of a professional, she was very good at teaching. It made me honestly appreciate this person&#8217;s effort since it was thanks to her that I was able to grow this much.　</p>
<p>I did have my talent though.　</p>
<p>Ah, now that I thought about it, what kind of sword school did sensei use? She seemed very familiar with swords, after all.　</p>
<p>“Oi, did your swordsmanship belong to any particular sword school?”　</p>
<p>“Eh, ah, well… yes…”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s just, how to say it, my sword school did not spread much… rather, it’s not supposed to be spread around, or something like that.”</p>

<p>Was it some sort of forbidden sword school?!　</p>
<p>That piqued my interest.　</p>
<p>“So, what kind of swordsmanship is it?”　</p>
<p>“Ah-, uhm, does Fay-kun know about the Garethia family?”</p>
<p>“…All I know is that it is your surname.”</p>
<p>“I guess so. It’s an aristocratic family which collapsed a few years ago… The swordsmanship adopted by the Garethia family belong Namikaze Seishinryuu, which is the sword school I use.” <span id="easy-footnote-1-20149" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-20149" title="T/N: The kanji involved with the sword school name is Nami: wave, kaze: wind, sei: refined/pure, shin: true/real, and ryuu: school of martial arts. Since I dunno how to translate the name into proper combination, I opted to use the Japanese name instead."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it&#8217;s just that this swordsmanship isn’t seen as a good thing by others… so I tried to not teach it to others…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>

<p>It made me hesitant to continue asking since she said it that way. I did think it would make me cooler if I used it, though.　</p>
<p>“…”　</p>
<p>“Uh, are you perhaps curious about the Namikaze Seishinryuu…?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m interested.”</p>
<p>“…Eeh, what should I do about this? Uhm, this swordsmanship is really not seen favorably by others… That’s why, if you do learn it, it’ll make it hard for Fay-kun to rise in rank… and your reputation will also get affected.”<br>“I didn’t join the knight brigade for rank or fame. It is to grow stronger.”</p>
<p>“…I, see.”</p>

<p>She was worried about it. Did she not want to teach me that much? Was the sword school cursed?　</p>

<p>“I’m pretty disliked among the paladins. Actually, it is considered a miracle I’m even entrusted to take care of you all… some people even think I robbed others’ success to land this job.”　</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>“I am a twelfth-rank paladin, the lowest rank there is. Originally, the people responsible for all of you {the special unit} were supposed to be well-reputed knights, but my acquaintance recommends me for this job. Well, I also taught other young knights about swordsmanship other than Fay-kun sometimes, but never once did I teach the Namikaze Seishinryuu.”</p>

<p>It seemed that this person had heavy circumstances to deal with… but I still wanted to learn it.　</p>

<p>“Since I’m only capable of using swords, the job I am entrusted with to is to fix other people with habits in their swordsmanship and allow them to gain experience in close quarter combat.”　</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“It’s not like Namikaze Seishinryuu is considered a unique sword school, but you&#8217;d likely get involved with troublesome things if others knew you learned it from me. Is that really alright with you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t mind. Teach me immediately.”</p>

<p>Ah, I intended to say “Please take care of me” there, but my autocorrect… Well, saying haughty words seemed to be common with my character. Sensei didn’t seem to mind it either.</p>

<p>“…Since you insist that much… I can’t refuse you as an instructor.”　</p>
<p>“…Ah, please.”</p>
<p>Then I will teach you the first move I learned: the first movement of Namikaze Seishinryuu, <em>Namikaze</em>.”</p>
<p>“…Please.”</p>

<p>Fuh, it seemed the event earlier was about testing the disciple determination, so it excited me.</p>

<p>“This is the first movement my father taught me. Fay-kun, please swing your sword from above to below toward me.”　</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>I swung my sword upfront with the speed of wind, no, of light. Then sensei laid her blade horizontally, and sensei’s sword intersected with mine like a cross, but at the next moment, sensei turned her sword tip downward and turned her blade vertically.　</p>

<p>Sensei’s blade, which was now vertical, deflected my sword that came from above, and the end of my sword touched the ground. Then sensei’s movement continued and her sword now pointed at my neck.　</p>

<p>“This is the <em>Namikaze</em>. It can deflect the enemy&#8217;s blade that come from above and give its user the chance to land a counter as it is. That’s basically it.”　</p>
<p>“…I understand.”</p>
<p>“It’s not as easy as it sounds, you know?”</p>
<p>“Of course I have no intention of underestimating it. However, you believe in my skill. That’s why you must be sure I’m able to do it as long as I put enough effort.”</p>
<p>“…Really, Fay-kun’s words sometimes sound as if you’re trying to flirt with me.”</p>
<p>“I have no such intention.”</p>
<p>“I know. Well then, let’s begin.”</p>
<p>“Aah.”</p>
<p>“…Fay-kun.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s bad to seek power. I like your honesty. There are many people who hated me until now. But you came to me every day for the last three month and asked me to teach you swordsmanship.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I feel quite happy about that. To be able to teach others like this… that’s why I… Fay-kun, please don’t seek strength as your goal. If you do, you’ll lose sight of what’s important. By that point, you will no longer feel the pain of losing it.”</p>
<p>“…Aah, I’ll remember your words.”</p>

<p>She really said something good. I will engrave it deep into my mind. Even so, this sensei sure was a good person. Perhaps she was about as good as Maria.　</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>For the girl named Bouran, weakness was something detestable. Whether it be from people who didn’t put in the effort to grow stronger, those who are strong but chose nasty methods, or the weak who were victimized by them, she hated them all.　</p>

<p>She was once a resident of a certain village. It was a village headed by a<em> beast</em> (beastman) as chief and full of <em>beasts</em>, wherein she was born as the child of the sole human concubine there. Her mother died soon after, and her human genes was stronger than the <em>beast, </em>which made others consider her human instead.</p>
<p>She was strong ever since she was born, whether it was her magic, pure strength, or fighting sense. She was clearly a strong person. However, she was discriminated against due to the fact she was considered a human, and people there feared the possibility she might aim to become the chief.　</p>
<p>Her half-brothers subjected her to vile traps. They drugged her and destroyed her chance to fight for the spot. Although she had no interest in that to begin with, nobody believed her, and she ended up seriously injured. 　</p>
<p>Ever since, she hated the weak.　</p>
<p><em>&#8212;I will become truly strong.</em>　</p>
<p>Hatred&#8211;her hatred for the weak was her everything.　</p>
<p>She somehow managed to survive and left her village. She thought that by becoming an adventurer and doing a lot of things, or by becoming a paladin and being active, there were the shortcuts to becoming a strong person.　</p>
<p>Then she saw him. A person named Fay who exuded the atmosphere of the strong. He was clearly a person who was cut off from others during the exam.　</p>
<p>He exuded the aura of a strong person, and Bouran had some expectations of him. However, he turned out to be a small fry.　</p>
<p>He was a small fry both in magic affinity and swordsmanship. It was a disappointment to her. He was a weak person she hated so much.　</p>
<p>Therefore, her interest went toward Arthur and Tlue instead. Those two were clearly strong people. Even compared to Bouran, their strength and talent were anomalous. She no longer put Fay in her eyes.　</p>

<p>However, her eyes were forcefully drawn to him.　</p>
<p>She didn’t notice. The hungry wolf that approached right beside her.　</p>

<p>“Err, Bouran-san and Fay-kun, please begin your mock combat.”　</p>
<p>“A-i.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>

<p>Fay and Bouran both put their stance. The distance between them was closed in an instant. They swung their sword to each other and clashed, making it appear like a sword dance.</p>
<p>The sounds of the wooden swords were heard, the sounds of their collisions.　</p>
<p><em>Huh? This guy… compared to before.</em>　</p>
<p>She felt something strange, something different. However, that wasn’t enough to defeat her. She won and repelled his sword away.　</p>

<p>The next day.　</p>
<p><em>…It’s still my victory.</em>　</p>

<p>The next day.　</p>

<p><em>Che, he swings his sword at troublesome spots…</em>　</p>

<p>She felt something intense gradually approach her. She noticed that his eyes, which contained his bizarre ambition, were getting closer and closer.　</p>

<p><em>…Damn it, we’re evenly matched now?</em>　</p>


<p>It was steadily approaching her. Before she knew it, the person she wasn’t even looking at her…　</p>

<p>Swords collided with each other. However, Fay launched a flowing series of attacks. As the onslaught continued, Bouran began to get impatient.　</p>

<p><em>I am losing? Against a weak person?</em>　</p>

<p>Sweat oozed as impatience filled her and her grip on her sword began to slip. She was driven to the corner by the constant rhythm. She was just desperately deflecting incoming attacks now.　</p>
<p>Attack came over and over like rain.　</p>
<p><em>&#8212;This rain will never stop until it defeats you.</em>　</p>
<p>His eyes and series of attacks seemed to say so. At last, the pressure was about to break her. However, she managed to endure. But by the next moment, due to the intense series of attack, sweat, and impatience, Bouran’s sword was knocked away.　</p>

<p>“It’s Fay’s victory!”　</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>

<p>It was Fay’s first victory. He, who never won against anyone even once, finally achieved his first win.　</p>
<p>Fay looked at Bouran. Their eyes met. His eyes were a void, as if saying he was no longer interested in her (the weak).　</p>
<p>“gh, bastard.”</p>
<p>“…Bouran-san.”</p>
<p>“Tch.”</p>

<p>Tlue interrupted her and Bouran clicked her tongue and stopped.　</p>
<p>“That’s definitely a fluke. There’s no way I&#8217;d lose against that small fry, against the weak…”　</p>
<p>She muttered so as if to remind herself. Tlue was looking at her behavior, yet he didn’t say anything. Then the training of the day was done, and since Fay only won once, he still had to do ten rounds around the capital upside down. 　</p>

<p>“Damn it! To think that I ended up defeated. By such a weak person!”　</p>

<p>It was at a certain corner of a vacant lot. Once training ended, Bouran began to swing her sword once the sun began to set. She usually returned to the dorm as soon as training ended, but she proceeded on some additional training just for today.　</p>

<p>“Bouran-san.”　</p>
<p>“Aah?! What is it, Tlue?!”</p>
<p>“No, well… I always think you seem to be mistaken about something, so I thought I needed to say it.”</p>
<p>“…Ah?!”</p>

<p>Bouran gave a dissatisfied look at Tlue who appeared all of sudden.　</p>
<p>“Please come along with me for a bit.”　</p>
<p>“…Tch. What’s up with you?”</p>
<p>Although Bouran gave a curt reply, she still followed him. After a while, they arrived at their usual training ground where there were three trees.　</p>
<p>“Do you see that?”　</p>
<p>“…It’s Fay, and Yururu too.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The sun had already set. Cool breeze blew past. However, the place they were looking at was like purgatory. There was a person there who was desperately trying to improve himself.　</p>

<p>“Is he still not done with his ten laps?”　</p>
<p>She referred to the ten laps around the capital upside down as the punishment for the minimal number of victories. However, Tlue answered her question with denial.　</p>
<p>“No, he already did that.”　</p>
<p>“…Hah?”</p>
<p>“He does this every day, after he is done with his ten laps.”</p>
<p>“…Every day. Even though we already trained that much&#8212;“</p>
<p>“That had nothing to do with him. I… I hated him. His violent attitude at the orphanage is already bad enough, and he also did tons of other bad things to me and others in the orphanage.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But he suddenly changed. Into something scary… and I become scared of him. However, there’s one thing I can say about him.”</p>

<p>Tlue spoke without expression.　</p>
<p>“He is a<strong> strong person</strong>.”　</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“He turns his solitude into strength and keeps on running. He suddenly became like that two years ago. I was always scared of him since then and became conscious of him. That’s why I can tell. He’ll keep on running. His initial steps have him dragging mud along, though.” <span id="easy-footnote-1-20196" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-20196" title="T/N: As in, he started late (his road was not paved properly) and he carried many errors he made before in the form of mud."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“However, it is no coincidence that he managed to win against Bouran-san today. He keeps on running. And now, he manages to touch Bouran-san’s back… I think that’s the case.”</p>
<p>“Why do you even bother telling me all this?”</p>

<p>When Bouran said that, Tlue revealed a bitter smile. No, perhaps it was closer to dry laughter. What he said was some sort of warning out of sympathy.　</p>

<p>“I also wonder why myself. But Bouran-san… <strong>if you keep underestimating him, you’ll be in for a world of pain</strong>.”　</p>
<p>It was a fear without deceit. Tlue who experienced that personally knew it well. Perhaps the girl in front of him would also taste that eventually.　</p>
<p>It was a fear similar to thinking of stepping on a snake, only to learn it was actually a dragon’s tail.　</p>

<p>“Just like me.”　</p>
<p>“…Did hear what you’ve just said?”</p>
<p>“Yes, as ashamed as I am, I’ve been traumatized by it… I don’t want to experience such fear anymore. Also, mock combat stops once the sword is knocked away, right?”</p>
<p>“…It’s a mock combat after all.”</p>
<p>“If you fight him for real, he’ll be as persistent as a snake. His persistence would make him endure the severity of pain and trial, allow him to become stronger, and eventually turn him into a dragon.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s all I want to talk about. I’m going somewhere else. I’ll get caught if I keep staying here.”</p>
<p>“…Oi, did you always watch him like this?”</p>
<p>“…I guess so. The sister at the orphanage requested me to, and I also didn’t want to look away, personally.” <span id="easy-footnote-2-20196" class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-20196" title="T/N: It’s Tlue trying to move on from his trauma, not other implicit meaning."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>

<p>Tlue was leaving as if to escape. The wind blew and she was left all alone. She thought of him as a weak person… but she began to reconsider.</p>

<p>She could win without a doubt if she used magic. However, that was no different than saying that she abandoned the match.　</p>
<p>Therefore, she decided to challenge him with nothing but swordsmanship…　</p>

<p>“I’ll admit it: you are <strong>a strong person</strong>. And remember this, Fay. I’ll win against you without fail.&#8221;　</p>

<p>She saw her nemesis and left. There are only strong people there.　</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">■◆</p>

<p>Yo! My first victory!! 1200 matches, 1199 defeats, and 1 victory! Well, to think I came this far. Even I understand what kind of character I was.　</p>

<p>I guess I was a hardworking protagonist. There was no doubt about it. To think that I was only convinced now after living here for over two years. So I was a cool-type yet keen on hard work, huh. That was why the challenge was naturally great.　</p>
<p>Well, I still have expectations that I have an awakening event that had not yet happened to me, though.</p>

<p>Perhaps I would defeat them in order of Bouran -&gt; Tlue -&gt; Arthur. Perhaps it was something like that?　</p>
<p>I guess I have to grow stronger step by step after all.　</p>

<p>Well then, the next one would be you, Tlue! I think I can defeat him if I train a bit more!　</p>

<p>Since I already defeated Bouran once, I wasn’t interested in her that much. It wasn’t that interesting to deal with an opponent I’ve already defeated once after all.　</p>
<p>I need to take one step after another.　</p>
<p>Also, Arthur was just way too strong. She was that dangerous. I still couldn’t see myself winning against her yet.　</p>
<p>But I would eventually win.　</p>
<p>I should put more effort, I guess?　</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">■◆</p>

<p>During the night when everyone was already asleep, there was a man walking alone in the city. It was hard to make out his appearance as he was mostly covered with a robe. He seemed to be looking for something.　</p>

<p>“Aah, I wonder if there is anyone that could be my experimental animal…”　</p>

<p>That person was walking with a dagger in hand.　</p>

<p>And finally, an arc of despair had begun.　</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
<p>Author Note:</p>
<p>Arthur: 1200 matches, 1200 victories, never defeated.</p>
<p>Tlue: 1200 matches, 750 victories, 450 defeats</p>
<p>Bouran: 1200 matches, 449 victories, 751 defeats</p>
<p>Fay: 1200 matches, 1 victory, 1199 defeats   </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without bothering to chase after Gawain, Schwarz spoke up cheerfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufufuu. It’s hard to really let loose when small fries are roaming up and about, so good call on that one. Oh, I nearly forgot to introduce myself. My name is Schwartz. Pleased to make your acquaintance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz gathered magic power in his palm as he said this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——So on that note, please go to hell.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With those words, it was released and flew straight to Zero at high speed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How impertinent, a mere devil.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero said, and then he dragonized only his arm and crushed Schwartz&#8217;s attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz, seeing this, let out a startled sound for the first time since he was summoned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?! It disappeared?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz was surprised and then took a peek at Zero&#8217;s status.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero&#8217;s level is higher than when he was in the labyrinth because of his occasional mock battles with Haruto.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Whoa, color me surprised. I knew you weren’t human, but to think that you are the dragon that has been holed up in that labyrinth all this while. How utterly disrespectful of me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having discovered Zero&#8217;s true identity, Schwartz bowed apologetically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then raised his head and opened his mouth with a look of admiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Still, I have to say, as expected of a dragon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Hmph.  Just bring it on.  I’ll entertain you a little.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kufufu, in that case don’t mind if I do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a smile on his face, Schwartz instantly moved in front of Zero and swung his vicious claws downward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero activated his hardened skill on his dragonized arm and easily blocked Schwartz&#8217;s blow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, talk about hard. I’d expect no less from the Dragon King.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero swung his fist to counterattack, but Schwartz ducked, flew into the air, and swung his arm sideways toward Zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Darkness Line!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Dragon Claw!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz&#8217;s invisible flash attack and the slash from Zero’s flying claw collided in mid-air and disappeared following a violent sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this, Schwartz nodded in admiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Despite being weakened, yet this much power&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;You mean this barrier.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufufuu, that’s right. Besides, you&#8217;re in your human form, so you shouldn&#8217;t be able to exert your true strength.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero did not reply, but Schwartz took his silence as an affirmation and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, as if in response, he launched a wind blade toward Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, how scary——Abyss Hole.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the wind blade was sucked into a black vortex that appeared in front of Schwartz&#8217;s outstretched palm and vanished. And at the same time, Schwartz&#8217;s figure disappeared from where he initially was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero muttered and then parried Schwartz’s attack who appeared behind him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Schwartz said earlier, Zero was considerably weakened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, Zero would have been stronger, but Schwartz now had the upper hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero and Schwartz were engaged in a fierce battle, clashing violently and exchanging magic attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s the matter? Your movements are becoming sluggish.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmph, look at you run your mouth, you cheeky devil——Come forth, Draconic Magic Sword Gloriace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero dropped his usual polite tone and switched back to his former rough-manner of speaking, and called out the name of his beloved sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to his voice, space distorted and a God&#8217;s sword appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz noticed something unusual the moment he laid eyes on the sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is one seriously inauspicious magic sword you got there, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Zero did not answer him and waved his left hand, which wasn’t holding the sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Dragon claw!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s no use——Darkness Line!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero&#8217;s figure disappeared from Schwartz&#8217;s sight, in the midst of the attacks clashing and canceling out each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—?! There you are!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh, guhaah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero thrusted his sword, but Schwartz ducked just in time and countered with a kick, blowing Zero away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz then noticed something and touched his cheek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——Blood? Oh yes, indeed it is&#8230;fufufuu, how ecstatic, seeing my blood again after such a long time! But, scarring me is a no no——Darkness Line!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The invisible blow struck, but Zero swung his magic sword, not wanting to be so easily bested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slash collided with darkness line and broke through it——then headed directly toward Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a nasty magic sword indeed. Then again&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz evaded and tried to unleash another move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Zero wasn’t about to let that happen, and unleashed a barrage of slash at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—It&#8217;s really nasty!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz received a number of shallow wounds while evading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustrated by the situation, he decided to get a little more serious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here I come.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero was still maintaining silence, but his eyes were more serious than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, Schwartz disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the same rapid movement he had performed repeatedly, but this time it was nothing compared to the previous ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero was slow to react to the unexpected speed and swung his sword backwards, where detect danger had reacted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there was nothing there, and Zero tried to retreat as quickly as possible——only to be grabbed by the leg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz, who was bending down, grabbed Zero&#8217;s leg, swung him around, and slammed him straight into the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ground caved in and cracked open like a spider web.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gahaa!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact caused Zero to exhale the air in his lungs, but for someone with the durability of a dragon, he didn’t suffer any particular damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero quickly stood up and leapt, approaching Schwartz, who was back in the air already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ll have to do better than that&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While putting on such a brave front attempting to swing his sword, Zero’s butler uniform was already in tatters and slightly stained with blood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwarz, who couldn’t possibly be hit by such an attack from Zero in his current state, moved swiftly and dove within Zero&#8217;s lethal range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Try stopping this one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz drove his sharp claws into Zero&#8217;s abdomen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Guh, gaaaahhh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood dripped down from the claws that were pulled out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Zero&#8217;s abdomen was bleeding without stopping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take things further, Schwartz kicked at the wound as a follow-up attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero was sent flying toward the cathedral and slammed into its majestic walls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hole opened in the cathedral, and it collapsed in a chain reaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, he actually flew quite a distance. Well, shall I head over as well. Looks like there’s no shortage of life energy from the reaction I’m getting over there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Schwartz licked the blood from his cheek with his tongue and smiled.</span></p>
