<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="background-color: black; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Do you know the iconic
item that often appears in movies about fraud?</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="background-color: black; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just by its appearance
on the screen, the tension of the entire audience explodes. You can rewind and
watch that scene over and over again without getting bored. If you want, you
can even watch it as a still image. It is such a cool and powerful item.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="background-color: black; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Well, if you are an
astute reader, you already know what I mean.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="background-color: black; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Yes, that's right.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="background-color: black; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The most powerful item
is the [Schematic Diagram].</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="background-color: black; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is the usual scene
where the villains gather in a dark and dusty room and have a strategy meeting
while staring at the [Schematic Diagram] pasted on the wall...... Is there
anyone in the world whose heart does not skip a beat at this?</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="background-color: black; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Try to put up sticky
notes with photos of the target, maps, and various other information in a
disorderly manner, or write arrows or figures in the margins in detail. See?
....... Of course, that would be cool, right?</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="background-color: black; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To tell you the truth,
the moment I was able to depict the strategy meeting scene using [Schematic
Diagram], it was as if the victory of this work was already decided. The
deceptions and tricks that unfolded over the course of more than 300 pages were
all conceived on the premise that [Schematic Diagram] would appear in the
story. That is why [Schematic Diagram] is such a supreme existence for fraud
schemes. It is no exaggeration to say that the reason why [Schematic Diagram]
did not appear in the first volume was a prelude to producing this
extraordinarily powerful catharsis. As a side note, I now hold the title of the
author who has used the word [Schematic Diagram] the most in the afterword of
all light novels. This is a great honor.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="background-color: black; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, the
[Schematic Diagram] will appear in the third volume as well. What kind of
activities will be shown in the next volume, I guess only God knows. ...... I
hope we have a blessed future.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="background-color: black; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">(Editor's note: The
author has come to his senses now that the second volume has been published.)</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-US" style="background-color: black; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Â </span></span></p>

to express my special thanks to all those who were involved in the publication
of this work and to everyone who picked up a copy of this work. See you next in
Volume 3.</span></span></p>

forward to the activities of Jin and Nina, and her new accomplice as well.</span></span></p>
