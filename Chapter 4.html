<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 4: Back Alley Skits, Magic Hour Attacks</h2>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper appeared in
front of the bus stop where Nina had agreed to meet him, dressed so stylishly
that it was impossible for her to look at him directly.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">First of all, the
number of accessories he was wearing was outrageous. As if he had never heard
of the concept of refrain, silver rings were attached to both of his wrists and
to all of its 10 fingers. His clothes were also all black, and to Nina, he
looked as if he were performing some kind of black magic ritual.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's quite a
unique attire......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Is it? I'm
trying to be rather modest today."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, Casper
would not have noticed the sarcasm, and for some reason, he only laughed in a
humble way. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina was taking a walk
around the dormitory when she was approached and asked out on a date at around
eight o'clock this morning. The reason there were three hours of free time
before the meeting was probably because he was carefully selecting his outfits.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just like last time,
Nina was to follow the instructions that were sent to her from the small
transceiver plugged into her ear. However, since Jin was waiting at the knife
workshop, the signal could not reach the bus heading for the downtown area.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This also meant that
she would have to use her own judgment when talking aboard the bus.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Sorry,
Nina-chan. I know it's not really nice of me to suddenly ask you out on the
very same day......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's okay, I was
free today anyway."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Actually, Nina wanted
to sleep all day to recover from yesterday's fatigue, but this is also an
important task, so there was nothing she could do.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She wasn't
enthusiastic about the date itself to begin with, but since Jin had prepared so
well, she couldn't get off the bus without his approval.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Right, when I first rode this bus, Jin was next to
me......</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina shook the memory
that suddenly came to her mind.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No. I have to
concentrate on my current task.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"By the way,
Casper-san, why are you carrying a guitar case?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well. I promised
you last time that I would write a song about how wonderful you are. I'm still
a beginner, but I hope I can convey this passion to you."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... If you
seriously insist on singing, I'll leave as fast as I can."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">I don't know how serious this guy is.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin reminded her to be
on her guard, but talking to Casper like this, it seemed unlikely that he is
the &lt;shepherd's dog&gt;.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Come to think of
it, Nina-chan, there are members of the &lt;White Knights&gt; in your family,
right?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She didn't expect such
a question to come flying at her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina turned the
tension switch back on once more.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Yes, my
two older brothers belong to it. Did I mention it before?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I read in a
newspaper article or something, is it true that they don't even tell their
families about the specifics of their work?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Since it's that
kind of a job, it certainly seems that there is a strong obligation to maintain
confidentiality. We never know where spies from other countries might be hiding
after all."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It must be very
difficult not being able to talk about one's true motives even with one's own
family......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She could not clearly
read the emotions from Casper's face as he said this.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At least, there was no
trace of acting there. Did he really just bring up the current topic as part of
some casual conversation?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The conversation
quickly moved in another direction, but Nina couldn't shake the feeling of
discomfort until the bus arrived at its destination.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After getting off the
bus, they walked for a while through the downtown area, which was lined with
street stores. Following the directions she had memorized last night, Nina saw
the store she was looking for in a deserted alleyway.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The stylishly written
sign reading &lt;Wates &amp; Pete's Cutlery&gt; was of such high quality that
it was hard to believe that it had been completed in one night. Gasta, the
landscaper whom she had met several times, had a rough appearance, but his
workmanship was surprisingly delicate. The unmotivated-looking clerk - a face
she had seen when she had built the pit at the school before - was one of Gasta's
most trusted subordinates, and it seemed he knew about Nina and Jin's
circumstances.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Anyway, the small
transceiver signal could reach her now.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina focused her
attention on the noisy instructions she could hear in her ear.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Nina, if you can hear
my voice, tilt your head to the left. ...... Okay. Let's reconfirm the
arrangements.]</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Entering the
surprisingly spacious store, she listened while acting as if she was gazing
intently at the knives.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Five minutes from
now. The three men will enter the store just in time for the counter clerk to
be shifted. One of them has a gun, but don't worry.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mr. Heath, who sold
them the gun, has made it so that the bullets won't come out. Their gang is so
small that they can't even afford to consume bullets for test firing, so they
don't know about it at all.]</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin must be watching
them from behind the hidden door behind the counter.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As for Nina, she has
no choice but to trust the information given to her by her accomplice.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[While the two of them
intimidate the waiter and the customers, the remaining one is planning to find
the finest quality goods in the wooden crate. The rest is up to you, Nina, to
successfully incite Casper to do his bidding. As long as we find out his
psychic abilities' true nature, today's objective will be accomplished.]</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina tapped lightly on
her ear to convey her understanding.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper, who was
unaware of the skit that was about to unfold in the store, looked at the knives
on display with a childlike gleam in his eyes.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hee, I didn't
know there were so many different kinds of knives."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They still had a few
minutes before the attack, so she decided to continue her conversation.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes. Knives are
often associated as something dangerous, but in fact, many of them are very
artistic."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, I can see
why you're into knives, Nina-chan."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"See, what do you
think of this one? It has a design of a snake coiled around the handle, and it
looks very difficult to use, doesn't it?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Certainly, I
don't think I could use it for cooking."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">"Artistry and
practicality don't necessarily match well together, after all. Look at this one
with the unusually long blade</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Everybody raise
your hands!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The robbers, who had
appeared two minutes earlier than scheduled, raised their voices.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The three men were
wearing black balaclavas to hide their faces, and the tallest man was clutching
a pistol.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As per the script she
had thought up beforehand, Nina whimpered.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......
Casper-san. Looks like we've been caught up in an unfortunate event."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Looks like it,
Nina-chan. What shall we do?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Contrary to the clerk
who surrendered easily, the two of them kept a relaxed expression on their
faces.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The leader of the
group, who had sensed their unusual reaction, came up to them and said,</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What are you
guys whispering about!?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You see, it's because
we're on a date."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Can't you see
your situation!? We have guns!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although she knew
there was no danger, this situation still made her tremble with fear. Nina
smiled, trying her best to suppress the urge to run away.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ahaha, do you
think you can handle us with just that thing?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Laughing in annoyance,
Casper lightly tapped the robber on the shoulder.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nina-chan, looks
like they really mean it."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"D-Don't tell me
you guys are heretics-......."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper must not know
that the pistol has been tampered with. And yet it was clearly outrageous that
he could behave in this manner.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[All right, Nina, go
incite Casper.]</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... What's
the matter? If your hand shakes so much, you wouldn't be able to aim properly."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After clearing her
throat, Nina turned to Casper.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"By the way,
Casper-san. I may look like this, but I'm a pacifist, and I don't want to
slaughter humans unnecessarily, no matter how many robbers there are."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I see, you're
very kind, Nina-chan......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"And I have my
doubts about your ability. No matter how meager the alliance may be, if your
psychic abilities are nowhere near as good as Karen-san's, then there's no
merit for me."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Huh, wait
a minute? Nina-chan, is there some kind of halo shining above you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Umm, are you
listening?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haha, I
know," Casper laughed lightly, "Shall I crush these annoying people a
little bit then?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Flames of murderous
intent lit up the eyes that peeked through the red hair's gaps.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper slowly lifted
his right hand and thrust his outstretched palm in front of the robber's face.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Five fingers slowly
closed as if to crush it. Then the robber suddenly began to scream in agony.
The hunched-over man retreated pitifully, his eyes fixed on Casper as if he
were looking at something terrifying.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Y-You, that
was......."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't look away,
look carefully. And remember how lucky you are to know the cause of your
death."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hiiih~, you
monster......!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was not clear if it
was a matter of angle or whatever was going on. Perhaps because it was only a
moment, the two remaining robbers who rushed to the scene didn't seem to
understand either.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">But there is no doubt that there is something with his
right hand.</span></i></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This is the last
warning I'm going to give you now."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper stated coldly
as he slowly approached the frightened robbers.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If you don't
want to get yourself killed, you've got ten seconds to get the hell out of
here. Ten, nine, eight ...... Oh shit, I'm getting tired of counting. Alright,
let's change it to three seconds. Three, two......."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The frightened man
shouted at his companions, who still didn't seem to realize the gravity of the
situation.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"L-Let's get out
of here, guys! This guy's nuts......!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Come on, hurry
up. Don't ever interrupt my date again!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The robbers ran away
as fast as they could, dragging their friends, who were too stunned to stand
up, along with them.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Only a really strong person can repel an opponent with
threats alone.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And it is not just a
bluff, like Nina's, that is a combination of bad reputation and acting. The
robbers clearly were terrified by what they witnessed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Something so vicious
that the robbers were so frightened and yet could instantly understand the
danger - what exactly did Casper generate with his psychic ability?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina had no clue, even
though she had him use his psychic ability right in front of her. All the time
and money spent on this farce was wasted.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[I couldn't see the
true nature of his ability. It can't be helped, Plan B.]</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina hastily switched
her thoughts.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Determining Casper's
psychic ability is the only a way to maintain the alliance with Karen. So, this
is not the time to be losing one's composure.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What is truly
important for Nina and Jin is to find the answer to the suspicion that Casper
may be the &lt;shepherd's dog&gt;. Originally, this plan was a two-step plan.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What do we do
now, Casper-san? Shall we go into another store before the police show up and
make things troublesome for us?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">According to Jin, the
experience of overcoming an unusual crisis together can help break down
psychological barriers. If they can find a moment to loosen Casper's guard,
they may be able to detect signs that he is connected with the school's
headmaster.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, Casper was
merely scratching his head with an awkward look on his face.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[He is not responding
very well. Nina, give another push.]</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... What's
wrong? Let's get out of here."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, hold on a
second."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper kept his
languid smile on his face, turned his back to Nina, and began to walk toward
the back of the store.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His action was so
natural that Nina could not immediately perceive that this was an urgent
situation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Wait a minute, Jin is still at the back of the
store.......</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She desperately tried
to formulate an excuse to stop Casper, but it was unlikely that she would be
able to do so in time.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Driven by frustration,
her heartbeat grew faster and it became difficult for her to breathe well. She
even had the illusion of despair seeping out from the corners of the ceiling
like a black mist.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I've been
feeling a presence since a while ago."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper, not heeding
the clerk who was trying to stop him, reached out his hand to the wall behind
the counter.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey, clerk. This
is definitely a hidden door, right?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper pushed on the
brick wall and a rectangular outline appeared on the wall. A metal shaft was
threaded through the shorter side of the rectangle, and the hidden door rotated
around it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper smiled like an
explorer who had discovered a hidden treasure and entered the darkened office
in the back.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What excuse would they
use to get out of this predicament?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Pretend that Jin is hired as a part-timer?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">No, that would
be too unnatural, especially given that students at the Heiberg Academy receive
monthly subsidies.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Shall I assert that I didn't know anything about it?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">No, Casper,
who already doubts the relationship between them, will not be deceived.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina felt a sense of
foreboding as she realized that hell awaited her at the end of every option.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This would be the end
of their fraud.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If Casper were the
&lt;shepherd's dog&gt;, the two fraudsters would be chased out of the school
and left to rot in the dark.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"..................
Huh?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina's bad
imagination, however, was quickly negated.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Behind the hidden door
- the room where Jin was supposed to be hiding - was completely empty. There
were only two very simple office desks lined up side by side, and no sign of
life.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's strange,
I definitely felt a presence here."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......
Casper-san, let's stop here. You're being rude to the clerk."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah! S-S-S-Sorry,
Nina-chan! That's not what I intended!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper bowed his head
while apologizing excessively even to the clerk. He even broke out in a cold
sweat, showing that he was truly sorry, apparently.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[...... Nina, let's
call it a day.]</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She could hear Jin's
voice in her ear, and she almost screamed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Since it was Jin, he
would probably go so far as to prepare even more sneaky measures in the hidden
room. Whatever the case, Nina was glad he was safe.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina let out a sigh
and lowered her tone of voice.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I think we
should end it for today."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wait, I've still
got ten different date plans in my hand. ......</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's for
another time. Well, see you later."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Aaah, wait,
Nina-chan! I'm sorry~!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina walked away into
the crowd, pushing aside her fear of turning her back on an opponent.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper screamed
pitifully for a while, but did not try to chase after her.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While brushing the
dust from his clothes, Jin observed Casper stunned in front of the knife store.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin had no idea how
Casper had noticed the hidden door, but he had prepared an escape route in case
it was needed, so it was no problem. He had Gasta create a mechanism whereby
the floor under the office desk could be removed to expose a hole just large enough
for a grown man to just barely fit through.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He originally wanted
to have a tunnel leading to another location, but the construction period was
too short this time. Just being able to curl up and hide in the hole alone was
considered good enough.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper stared at the
sky for a while, but after a while, he gave up and started to walk slowly
toward the city.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He was walking in the
opposite direction from the bus stop.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Where in the world is
he going?</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Can you
go home first, Nina? I'll try to tail him for a bit."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Turning off the small
transceiver, Jin chased after Casper as he walked away.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper looked
dejected, as if he had lost all his money, and was walking so slowly that
people passing by were annoyed. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Was that how
much he had devoted himself to this date?</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">No, it is
dangerous to speculate only based on the surface.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The insight to spot a
hidden door with a single glance.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The discretion to draw
a line between himself and others at the last minute.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There are just too
many concerns to judge Casper as an insignificant opponent.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While following him at
a certain distance, Casper entered a deserted back alley.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The atmosphere has a
distinctly different feeling than that of the main street.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Graffiti all over the
walls. Trash lying on the street spread a foul odor. A steel frame protruding
from the outline of the building cast countless shadows on the street, as if
renovation work was being done on a nearby building, and the sound of
single-pipe scaffolding being assembled rang out like an alarm. The melancholy
wafting from Casper's back grew thicker, and even the shadows he cast on the
ground seemed to be a little darker than the surrounding area.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">What on earth
could he possibly be up to in such a deserted street?</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin considered several
possibilities, but none of them seemed plausible.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As a precaution, he
raised his vigilance up one more level.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He took a deep breath,
stretched his conscious mind to the tips of his toes, and adjusted his
concentration to be ready for any situation.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">It was at that very moment that he was tapped on the
shoulder from behind.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When he turned around,
he saw Casper Crawford standing there with a thin smile on his face. The figure
that should have been in front of him just a moment ago has vanished like an
illusion or a phantom.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... I thought
who was following me, so it's you."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">*Clang, clang, clang,
clang.*</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sound coming from
the construction site overlapped with the beating of his heart.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The Empire has
been so rowdy lately that it makes me unnecessarily cautious, huh?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">*Clang, clang, clang,
clang.*</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Suddenly, the sun was
blocked by clouds, making it impossible to read the expression on the face of
the person in front of him.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So? Why did you
follow me?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">*Clang, clang, clang,
clang.*</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin spun his brain
frantically.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">First, he had to
analyze his opponent's psychic ability. If he were to accept what just
happened, Casper's ability would be something like instantaneous movement.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But then, what was the
frightened look of those robbers?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The second thing to
consider is the presence or absence of hostility.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper's dislike of
men is a usual occurrence, but it would be a different story if he had lured
them into an alleyway like this by pretending not to notice that he had been
followed. It would not be any surprise if a large number of armed men were to
pop out of the shadows right now.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It might be best not
to say anything right now.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper stared at Jin,
who was cautiously waiting to see what his opponent would say, and slowly
opened his mouth.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Don't
tell me, Nina-chan asked you to do this?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"............?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"She asked you to
secretly follow her around because she's nervous on her first date?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin was speechless at
the outrageous misunderstanding.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Normally, he would
have complained, but now he should welcome this misunderstanding with open
arms.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... What a
good intuition you have. You're right."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Seriously ......
I could escort her gently, though."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-Well, it means
that Nina doesn't think so."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">What the heck? Is love really all he cares about?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin thought that it
had been a long time since he had felt his pace so disrupted.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin's usual tactic is
to read what's going on behind the scenes and strip the other party's
psychology completely bare, but with an opponent this unpredictable, even those
basic principles won't work.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even through the eyes
of a fraudster, it is impossible to tell whether Casper really has nothing in
mind, or whether he is actually devising a grand scheme behind the scenes, even
though he appears to be full of gaps.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In his bewilderment,
Casper turned his head down and began lowering his shoulders. Jin almost felt
sorry for him, even though he knew it might be a trap.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Umm,
look, dude. Cheer up."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa~, do I look
disheartened to you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Not at all! I'm
actually on fire!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">He suddenly recovered, huh?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin wanted to leave so
badly, but he managed to hold his ground.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Listen, I know a
kid like you won't understand this, so let me tell you something. The more
impregnable the opponent is, the more passionate true love is. The way she's so
cautious of me makes it all the more exciting, no? This is the real thrill of
love!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"In other words,
you won't give up to the point of annoyance?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't interpret
my words in any way you like!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm glad to hear
that you haven't been completely rejected. Then, good luck the next time you
see her at school."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haha-n, you're
trying to catch me off guard by saying that, right?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ha? What do you
mean?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You said you
were just childhood friends ...... but you actually like Nina-chan too, don't
you? If you didn't, you wouldn't have agreed to do this task for her."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a fearless smile
on his face, Casper pointed to the tip of Jin's nose.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Fine, Jin
Kirihara. Bring it on. You want to compete with me for Nina-chan, don't
you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ha? I never said
something like-......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, I know. I'm
not so low that I won't accept a love rival's declaration of war. Once we get
back to the school, we're going to have a duel right away. The loser will
forget all about Nina-chan. Sounds simple right?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wait, can you
please not proceed on your own?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"....... Alright,
I'll take that as a sign of consent."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't. You are
so bad at conversations, you know that?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As long as he doesn't
know the full extent of Casper's psychic abilities, he has no chance of winning
if he fights with him now. Besides, he could not afford to be involved in
danger due to such a nonsensical flow.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin was not supposed
to agree to the &lt;duel&gt; until the very end, but Casper walked away with a
look of satisfaction on his face.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... This is
seriously becoming troublesome."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin sighed heavily.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From now on, Casper
would be persistently pestering him.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Whether he truly
thought of Jin as a love rival or whether he was actually the &lt;shepherd's
dog&gt; and was looking for an excuse to get close to Jin - it would still be a
troublesome situation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If the situation were
to get any worse, he would be in a catastrophically bad situation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">So Jin decided to
accelerate the board at once.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"> The next day </span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina walked down the
hallway to her classroom, dragging her gloomy emotions with her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She was worried about
the progress of the fraud she and her accomplice were working on.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was good until they
were able to get close to two of the targets, but they had not been able to
obtain any information that would lead to proof that they were the
&lt;shepherd's dogs&gt;.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin said it was
inevitable because they had just started, but Nina thought he was being a
little too optimistic. They might not even get close to the bottom of this if
things continue to go on like this.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Above all, Nina was
becoming overwhelmed by the horror of this task.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The contradiction of
having to probe into a serious secret that the target might be harboring, while
also harboring a serious secret herself. If the target was honest, she would be
taking advantage of their honesty.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Doubt, distrust, and
self-loathing - a whirlwind of emotions engulf Nina.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is the world of
fraudsters.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Has Jin lived all his
life in such an unredeemable place?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Is she really prepared
to deceive someone else, even to the point of bearing the unforgivable sin?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, she is an
overwhelmingly powerful person feared throughout the school, so her expression
and attitude must be filled with confidence.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She must keep her
anxiety and conflicts inside her heart.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, Nina-chan.
Good morning."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A classmate who came
running from the front called out to her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The emotional
stagnation seemed to clear away as soon as she saw Emma's cheerful smile.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Good morning,
Emma" Nina asked an obvious question. "What's the rush? Besides, our
classroom is that way, right.......?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nina-chan, have
you seen a brown paper bag on your way to the classroom?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A paper bag? No,
I haven't."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm in trouble
...... I always keep my candies in that paper bag."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her psychic ability of
the &lt;ferocious sweetener&gt; can double her physical capabilities while she
licks the lollipop. It's natural to feel anxious about the loss of the candy
that is the very lifeline of it.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What should I
do, class is about to start......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Do you have
spare ones?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes, I have some
in my room."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Then, let's go
get it together at the next break. I'm sure no one will attack you in such a
short period of time and I will protect you if it happens."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Really!? Thank
you, Nina-chan!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When Emma hugged her
with a carefree smile, a cruel question crossed Nina's mind.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">If I had to be suspicious of everyone who approached me,
what about Emma?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">She was the
first classmate to speak to me when the others looked at me with frightened
eyes.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">But what if
Emma was approaching me for some purpose?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">In fact, she
did not hesitate to talk to Jin, who maintained his loner status. No matter how
sociable she might be, isn't that a little too much?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Thinking that much,
Nina hurriedly shook her head.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It's disgusting to doubt
one own friend.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even if she becomes a
fraudster, she can't lose her humanity as well.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That would be no
different from the upper echelons of the empire and the academy, who are
working out dangerous plots behind the scenes. She has no right to condemn the
&lt;White Knights&gt;, who killed Jin's father and continue to dispose of
disturbing elements throughout the country.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">I will end up being the same creature as those cruel
older brothers.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina mobilized all her
acting skills and forced a soft smile.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Emma-san, shall
we go back to the classroom for now?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A crowd had gathered
in front of the classroom.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Everyone was peering
into the classroom, whispering something to each other in gossipy tones, and
the entrance was completely blocked. Most of the onlookers were students from
another class.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina wanted to find
out what was going on, but Emma, walking next to her, was preoccupied with
something else entirely.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah! My paper
bag!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma rushed toward a
female student wearing round glasses that covered half of her face. She was
apparently holding a brown paper bag with both hands.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Sorry to ask
this all of a sudden, but where did you pick up that paper bag?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Oh, were
you the one who dropped it? Here you go."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The memory drawer
opened up when Nina saw the blank expression on the female student's face as if
she had never laughed in her entire life. She didn't immediately recognize her
because she was in uniform, but she was Satya Rodel, Karen's personal maid.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Since her alliance
with Karen is a secret, there is no way she can greet her here.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Satya seemed to be
aware of this and only made eye contact with Nina for a moment.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I found it lying
in the corner of the hallway. Perhaps it was bumped by some passerby right
after it was dropped."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Unn, I should be
more careful. Anyway, thank you!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, you don't
have to thank me."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina felt bad for
Emma, who was having an emotional reunion with the paper bag, but that was not
what she was concerned about.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She decided to ask
Satya, pretending that it was their very first meeting.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Umm, what's
going on in the classroom?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... You can
tell just by looking at the blackboard."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Doing as she was told,
she leaned out of the crowd to check the blackboard at the very front of the
classroom.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Seeing the writing
there, Nina gasped.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[We know there are
rats in this class. This is a declaration of war.]</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The message was
written in a rough, violent font, using the entire area of the blackboard.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina tried to digest
the meaning of the word [rats].</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If she thinks about
it, the message is directed at the infiltrators who have infiltrated the school
to uncover its secrets - in other words, it is a threat directed at them.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps it was the
&lt;shepherd's dog&gt; who wrote this message.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If so, what is the
purpose?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Should she take it as
a literal declaration of war? Or as a warning? To set as an example to others?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">No, let's be calm first.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She couldn't let
anyone know how agitated she was.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She had to accept that
sentence as just a mere occurrence.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a furrowed brow,
as if she had just witnessed a silly prank, Nina returned to Emma and the
others.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If the &lt;shepherd's
dogs&gt; has uncovered Nina and Jin's true colors, there should be no need for
them to leave such a message to alert them. Especially since Nina is supposed
to be a powerful psychokinesis user, it would be safer for them to launch a
surprise assault on her while she remained unaware of it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In other words, the
other party has not yet obtained any conclusive evidence.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They were probably
hoping to gauge Jin and Nina's reactions when they saw the message, and if
anything suspicious was found, that would be good enough. Possibly, there are
other potential candidates for the rats besides Jin and Nina.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What a
disturbing graffiti. I wonder what it means."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmmm. I have a
feeling there's a grand riddle hidden in there......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma tilted her head
with an expression like a child excited to solve a riddle. The majority of the
other students probably think it's nothing more than the sudden appearance of
an entertaining and unusual event.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Only two people in the
school are being suffocated by the graffiti.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well then, I
shall return to my classroom."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Satya, the only one
who had remained indifferent, bowed her head reverently.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Come to think
of it, why is this girl here?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">She doesn't
look like the type of person who would be an onlooker, but was she perhaps
instructed by Karen to do some reconnaissance?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As they passed each
other, Satya whispered something in Nina's ear.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......
Karen-sama wants to discuss something with you tomorrow after school."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Discussion.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What should have
sounded so peaceful, now had an ominous tinge to it.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"She wants you to
keep your schedule open. Stingray-sama."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In other words, Satya
was here to tell her this.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina felt that
something was beginning to move under the surface. What that something is, Nina
does not know. She also does not know to what extent her accomplice, Jin, is
aware of this.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Could this be...... a serious predicament?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Unanswered questions
swirled around, trying to engulf Nina in chaos.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">＊</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The target was clearly
flustered when she saw the message written on the blackboard.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although she
immediately seemed to have regained her calm expression, her pupils dilated for
a moment, and she visibly gulped down fresh saliva. Only someone who perceived
the message as a threat would react that way to a mere scribble.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A lowly rat, who
planned to infiltrate the Heiberg Academy and uncover the school's secrets.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There were several
suspects, but it could be said that most of them have now been identified.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She calmly analyzed
the information obtained from her investigation so far.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The fact that this guy
has been contacting multiple students is also probably for the purpose of
gathering information to expose the &lt;shepherd's dog&gt;. In the extremely competitive
world of the Heiberg Academy, not many students would make such a strange move.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The target seemed to
be moving cautiously to avoid giving conclusive evidence, but that was
irrelevant to her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">All that mattered was
to forcefully extract a confession.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is the same method
that the &lt;White Knights&gt; use to deal with wanted criminals, enemy spies,
and dangerous political figures. As long as they use this method, they can
extract as much information as they want.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That is the kind of
training she has had since she was a child.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The scribbles on the
blackboard were erased before the instructor arrived, and class began as if
nothing had happened.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">During the day, which
was rather unusually full of only classroom lectures, Nina repeatedly stole
glances at the profile of her accomplice, who was seated far away from her. Jin
was still listening to the instructor's speech with a bored expression on his
face, and she could not read what he felt when he saw the scribbles.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Time flew by, and
before she knew it, the final chime signaled the end of the day.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">I have to talk to Jin as soon as possible.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That was all Nina
could think about for the last two hours or so.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She quickly packed her
bags, said goodbye to Emma, who was sitting next to her, and walked down the
path leading to the gymnasium.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even in such a dire
situation, the sky was magically beautiful.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sun was setting
over the horizon, casting a final glow on a world that was turning to night.
The artistic gradation of orange and purple had a somewhat artificial feel to
it, and it was hard to believe that there was no one else's intention behind
it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At the end of the
path, she saw Jin walking with his black hair tied behind his back, swaying as
he walked.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She has repeatedly
been told to walk a different route each time she heads to the gym, taking a
longer detour than necessary. So it was rare for them to bump into each other
like this.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Hmmm? Isn't he walking awfully slow?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It didn't take long
for her to realize that this was a signal for her to walk alongside him.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina took large
strides so as not to look unnatural and lined up next to Jin.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's unusual to
see you here, Jin."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I was just
taking a walk before dinner. By the way, what are you having for dinner
tonight, Nina?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa~?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina was bewildered by
the topic, which was so peaceful that it didn't suit him, but she looked at
Jin's fingertips and sensed his intention. A hand signal made a circle with the
thumb and middle finger and the rest of the fingers held straight up.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">There is someone following us.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And there was only one
person they could think of who would be following them at this moment in time.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was the person who
had written the message on the blackboard declaring war - the &lt;Shepherd's
Dog&gt;.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This was the reason
why Jin had chosen to talk about something that could be overheard by anyone.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina also decided to
go along with the conversation. If she mentioned the scribbles on the
blackboard, it might be interpreted as a confession.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She took a slow, deep
breath, taking advantage of the break in the conversation. It's still not as
good as Karen's breathing technique, but it's effective enough to help her
concentrate a little more.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, she
prepared herself to deal with the situation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina ruminated over
the next steps in her head.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If this went well,
they might be able to capture the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; who tried to ambush
them instead. Then she would be able to put an end to the dangerous scheme she
was pulling on Karen and Casper.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin waved his wrist
through the air.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">A signal to begin the operation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From this point on,
they cannot relax, not even for a moment.</span></p>
