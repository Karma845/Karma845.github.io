<h2>Afterword</h2>
</div>



<p>First, I would like to thank everyone for picking up <em>Lady Savage Fang &#8211; History&#8217;s Greatest Mercenary Reincarnates as the World&#8217;s Cruelest Lady and Becomes Peerless in this Second Life</em>. This is Akashi Kakkaku speaking.</p>



<p>I would like to thank the illustrator, Kayahara-san, my head editor, the proofreaders, all the sales people, and the many others who were involved with the publishing.</p>



<p>And now that I&#8217;ve expressed my gratitude at the beginning as usual, I just want to say…</p>



<p>I&#8217;m so happy I was able to release a new series! Yay!</p>



<p>A lot of things happened this time around.</p>



<p>There was a lot of strange overlap in work, I got sick, I started writing a contemporary fantasy story on the side and then it somehow became a whole book… I ended up causing a lot of trouble.</p>



<p>…Huh? Are you saying I always mention how much trouble I&#8217;ve caused in the afterword?</p>



<p>Well, let&#8217;s not think too hard about it, or else my heart might just shatter into a thousand pieces.</p>



<p>No, but really, I am very sorry.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>So let&#8217;s talk about this new series… The other series I&#8217;ve written all have long titles, but this one is especially long.</p>



<p>Well, it&#8217;s probably because I&#8217;ve combined the main title with a sub-title.</p>



<p>So from hereon, in the afterword or when I talk about it, I&#8217;ll just refer to it as Lady Savage Fang.</p>



<p>Content-wise, it&#8217;s similar to <em><a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/bu-ni-mi-wo-sasagete-hyaku-to-yonen-elf-de-yarinaosu-musha-shugyou/">Bu ni Mi wo Sasagete Hyaku to Yonen. Elf de Yarinaosu Musha Shugyou</a></em>, where the reincarnation stays in the same world. However, instead of reincarnating into the future, the main character is taken to the past, and the twist is that they became a completely different person.</p>



<p>So what do you think of this story, about how a barbaric mercenary becomes a noble lady?</p>



<p>I hope I was able to convey her dazzling manliness.</p>



<p>I struggled to write it in the beginning, and it wasn&#8217;t until I was writing the second half that I really began to feel it. It&#8217;s a little embarrassing if you were able to tell from the writing.</p>



<p>In fact, compared to my past works, we actually had many more revisions from the first draft, up until the last minutes.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m really grateful to the person who took care of me, for cooperating with me the entire time. Thanks to you, we turned that first draft &#8212; one I had no confidence in &#8212; into a complete manuscript I am proud of!</p>



<p>I&#8217;m also very grateful to the illustrator, Kayahara-san.</p>



<p>I received the character designs in the middle of the revisions, so the characters of Lady Savage Fang were very clear in my mind.</p>



<p>In the climactic battle, for example, I wrote it that way because I kept thinking &#8220;I want to make this character do this!&#8221;. The designs were a huge influence on me.</p>



<p>And again, I would like to thank everyone!</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s all I had to say about the book itself.</p>



<p>As I&#8217;m writing this afterword, everyone around me is playing a certain game about hunting monsters.</p>



<p>Even though I haven&#8217;t been following from the beginning, I think it&#8217;s great that a series that&#8217;s been around for fifteen years is still releasing new games, and it&#8217;s wonderful that its story hasn&#8217;t come to an end yet.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s amazing whenever a new entry for a beloved series comes out… It made me feel a bit jealous, but seeing how the series continues to evolve and improve makes me happy that people loved it so.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s wonderful that they continued to improve while staying true to their fundamentals.</p>



<p>I wish I could be just like that, even if only a little.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>And as usual, I just ended up talking about games again, and now I&#8217;m running out of space in the afterword.</p>



<p>Me being me, I&#8217;ve written a lot of afterwords, and I keep thinking about how I&#8217;ve run out of things to say, but then, before I know it, I&#8217;ve almost finished writing it anyway. Maybe I just enjoy writing my afterwords more than I think.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>And as usual, allow me to put down my pen for a moment to thank everyone.</p>



<p>Thank you so much for picking up Lady Savage Fang.</p>



<p>The world is going through a difficult time right now, but I hope this book was able to help alleviate some of the rising stress of everyday life, even if only a little bit.</p>



<p>Anyway, I hope to see everyone again next time!</p>
