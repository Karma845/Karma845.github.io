<h1>Interlude 1</h1>

<p>Having a striking appearance inevitably attracts attention, whether you like it or not.</p>



<p>I’m not seeking the spotlight; I just want to be myself, peacefully. In the confined space of the classroom, where individuality stands out, the reception for those outside the norm can be harsh.</p>



<p>But I couldn’t care less.</p>



<p>Even if it means facing losses, I’d rather be true to myself. I’m not as transparent as others may easily perceive, and I don’t need shallow empathy or surface-level understanding.</p>



<p>What I desire is to be embraced for who I am, just as I am.</p>



<p>So, at first, he wasn’t a particularly memorable guy.</p>



<p>Sena Kisumi.</p>



<p>Uncommon first name, yet no distinct features; an average person without noticeable traits. If not for being a class representative, his face and name wouldn’t leave a lasting impression.</p>



<p>He had a go-with-the-flow, good-natured personality. He is accustomed to taking care of things since both his parents work and he has a younger sister in elementary school.</p>



<p>He has average grades, earnestly taking notes during class, but the type to frantically review before exams. He has average height—neither too tall nor too short. Regarding his looks, you can say that his age equals the length of time he’s been single.</p>



<p>He’s an unremarkable, commonplace boy. Due to his position as the class representative, he often interacts with people he’s not particularly close to. During such times, he subtly and smartly navigates through, leveraging his lack of distinctive characteristics.</p>



<p>He doesn’t impose himself on anyone, yet he skillfully brings out the other person’s opinions. Acting as a buffer, he was adeptly integrating the entire class. He’s like air we breathe, unnoticed yet indispensable.</p>



<p>The comfort in our class stems from his almost invisible presence, effortlessly balancing the class. Not by standing out with excessive enthusiasm or vigor, but by quietly dealing with issues before they escalate.</p>



<p>Yes, air is invisible but essential. Without it, life ceases to exist.</p>



<p>And that’s when I realized I’d developed an interest in him without even noticing.</p>
