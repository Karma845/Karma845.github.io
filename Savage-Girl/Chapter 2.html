<h1>Chapter 2: The Hidden Side of Everyone’s Admiration</h1>


<p>“Ugh!”</p>

<p>During the lunch break on the next day,</p>
<p>While walking down the hallway leading to the Student Council room, Chifuyu came from ahead and let out an irritated voice.</p>

<p>“Why is Kagisaka here?”</p>
<p>“I have something to do in the Student Council room.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Did you stop ignoring me?”</p>

<p>She glared at me, the silver-haired gal who I never bothered to talk to before.</p>
<p>Well, it’s not like I ignored her willingly.</p>
<p>If I didn’t act that way, my true identity might be exposed to Chifuyu.</p>

<p>My online otaku friend—— As Senpai and Kouhai-chan.</p>
<p>That’s the other relationship between Kimitaka Kagisaka and Kazami Chifuyu.</p>
<p>However, Chifuyu hasn’t realized that I am Senpai.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s too late to start talking now. Unlike Azusa, I’ll never be friends with you.”</p>
<p>“That’s a pity.”</p>
<p>“…Muu. You seem unfazed by that. So even if you can’t be friends with me, you don’t care?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like that.”</p>

<p>Well, I understand why she doesn’t want to become friends with me.</p>

<p>In the DM from last night, between otaku talks:</p>
<p>『Senpai~! Listen to this~!』”</p>
<p>『 What’s up?』</p>
<p>『Remember when we talked before? I told you about the guy my childhood friend has a crush on.』</p>
<p>『Yes, why?』</p>
<p>『Well, that guy and Azusa finally became friends. Lately, they’ve been spending a lot of time together, even doing class committee work together. As a result, the time Azusa and I spend together has decreased…』</p>
<p>『Are you feeling lonely?』</p>
<p>『Wow, you hit the nail on the head! I want to support Azusa’s love as her best friend, but it’s still too lonely!』</p>

<p>She must be feeling a complex mix of emotions about her best friend and me becoming close.</p>

<p>(I thought about avoiding Chifuyu in real life as I have done in the past…)</p>

<p>Spending more time with Tomori has led to more encounters with her best friend, Chifuyu.</p>
<p>However, if I keep refusing to talk, it might raise unnecessary suspicions, like ‘Isn’t Senpai actually Kimitaka Kagisaka?’</p>

<p>“By the way…”</p>

<p>As I was lost in thought, Chifuyu asked, changing the topic.</p>

<p>“Are you going to dance with Azusa at the prom?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t made any promises like that.”</p>

<p>I added in my mind, ‘at least for now.’</p>
<p>The prom is an event Tomori mentioned on her secret account before.</p>
<p>It’s a party organized by the academy for second-year students of Aisu after the graduation ceremony.</p>

<p>“It’s quite unusual, isn’t it? The prom is an event usually seen in overseas high schools.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. You often see it in American TV shows.”</p>

<p>It’s relatively popular in countries like America, and there, it’s usually held for third-year students before their graduation.</p>
<p>But at Aisu, it takes place at the end of the first semester for second-year students.</p>

<p>“The prom might not mean much to an external exam student like you, but it’s a coveted event for Aisu students.”</p>
<p>“Is it true that only second-year students can participate?”</p>
<p>“Generally, yes. However, all student council members can attend the prom under the pretext of supervision, regardless of their grade.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>The venue is the gymnasium, lavishly decorated for just one night.</p>
<p>It’s customary for participants to dress up in rented dresses or tuxedos.</p>

<p>“In foreign proms, there’s a rule about choosing a partner and inviting them to dance before the event. What about Aisu’s prom?”</p>
<p>“It’s not mandatory to dance with someone.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really?”</p>
<p>“Just attending the party, engaging in conversation, and enjoying the meal is perfectly fine. However, Aisu is a highly prestigious school, and there are many students from upper-class backgrounds. Some of them already have experience in ballroom dancing.”</p>
<p>“But there must also be students without any dance experience, right?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Every year, the student council holds dance practice sessions.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I remember hearing about that.”</p>

<p>Tomori mentioned it before. And perhaps, she intends to ask me to dance.</p>

<p>(Ballroom dancing, huh?)</p>

<p>Back when I was at home, I used to attend such parties frequently, and it was kind of drilled into me as part of my education.</p>
<p>So, I can dance to some extent…</p>
<p>“I can understand why everyone would want to dance. There are superstitions surrounding the prom.”</p>
<p>“Superstitions? What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Wow, you seriously don’t know!? Even though you’re a student at Aisu!? Normally, someone would have told you!”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I didn’t have any friends until recently…”</p>
<p>“You’re such an information-illiterate loner! Anyway, look forward to that day. I was just called to the student council room, and guess what? I’ll be playing the piano at the prom.”</p>
<p>“Huh… Really?”</p>
<p>“Why are you so surprised?”</p>

<p>It’s not surprising at all, as I know as Senpai.</p>
<p>Chifuyu may have a gal-like appearance, but she comes from a musical family and is one of the top piano players in the country.</p>
<p>Winning competitions used to be a regular thing for her.</p>
<p>However, this girl is——</p>

<p>“I didn’t expect Kazami to be able to play the piano.”</p>

<p>I tried to cover up my thoughts from being read.</p>
<p>Then Chifuyu frowned, seemingly displeased.</p>

<p>“Don’t act unimpressed with my performance, okay? I might have been slacking off on practice lately, but I’ll be well-prepared for the prom. I don’t have anyone I want to dance with, so I’ll focus on the piano.”</p>
<p>“Kazami must have plenty of suitors, though.”</p>

<p>Her appearance is considered the cutest in the grade. While not at Tomori’s level, she could easily have received multiple confessions.</p>

<p>“Of course, I was asked by a few people, but I turned them all down. Because…”</p>

<p>Her voice trailed off.</p>
<p>Chifuyu’s silver hair sways. She wore a melancholic expression and said,</p>

<p>“…The person I truly want to dance with isn’t here at this school.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“Sigh, why isn’t Senpai one of our students?”</p>
<p>“For now, I get it that you have someone you like outside the school.”</p>
<p>“…Sympathy? I’m sorry. Even if you suddenly act kind, I won’t dance with you. Because I just said it… I-I like Senpai!”</p>
<p>“…okay.”</p>
<p>“I love you from the bottom of my heart! Senpai is way cooler than Kagisaka!”</p>
<p>“I-I see”</p>
<p>“He’s my ideal man! Wild, smart, kind, and he cares so much about me!”</p>
<p>“…Is there really someone like that?”</p>
<p>“What!? Why are you so skeptical?”</p>

<div><img src="../Images/0007_T24.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/T24.png  --></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>Being praised like this makes it hard to believe it’s about me.</p>
<p>I do care about Kouhai-chan, but the things she said about me… I can’t believe they’re true.</p>

<p>“Hmph. As expected of an introvert, someone like you can just stay lonely at the prom. Don’t worry; my performance will cheer you up.”</p>
<p>“You’ll play something for me?”</p>
<p>“How about Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 8? ‘Pathetique,’ doesn’t it suit you?” (Grande Sonate pathétique)</p>

<p>With a farewell, Chifuyu walked down the hallway, and I couldn’t help but smile wryly.</p>
<p>Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 8, titled “Pathetique.”</p>
<p>It’s the perfect piece to give to a loner as a present.</p>

<p>(Well, the possibility of being alone on the day is quite high.)</p>

<p>If, by any chance, I end up dancing with someone, it would probably be Tomori.</p>

<p>“——No.”</p>

<p>Are there any other candidates?</p>

<p> </p>


<p>While pondering this, as I was about to knock on the door of the Student Council room——</p>

<p>“I-I like the Student Council President!”</p>

<p>The voice from inside made my hand stop involuntarily.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I’m happy that you confessed, but I’m not planning to date anyone right now.”</p>
<p>“…Ugh! N-No, I’m sorry too. The President is a serious, flawless goddess. There’s no way good-for-nothing like me could be a match for you——”</p>
<p>“Please don’t blame yourself.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t see what was happening inside.</p>
<p>However, the voice of the girl who rejected the confession sounded incredibly gentle.</p>

<p>“Don’t call yourself good-for-nothing. You’re the ace of the club, and you had great results at the inter-high last year. You might get a little passionate sometimes, but I know you’re a really good person.”</p>

<p>Her voice had a captivating and mature tone that anyone couldn’t help but be enchanted by.</p>
<p>It seemed like the perfect follow-up to turn down a confession.</p>
<p>But——</p>

<p>“T-Then!”</p>

<p>Perhaps because it was too perfect, it made the other person feel something more.</p>

<p>“If you say that, could you try going out with me?”</p>
<p>“Sadaoka-kun…”</p>
<p>“Please, Kaichō (President)! I promise you won’t regret it!”</p>

<p>The boy pleaded earnestly.</p>
<p>The girl addressed as the Kaichō seemed visibly troubled.</p>

<p>(What should I do?)</p>

<p>If this were a complete stranger, I could excuse myself and leave, but this time, I can’t do that.</p>
<p>So, after knocking, I opened the door to the Student Council room.</p>

<p>“Ah, I’ve been waiting for you.”</p>

<p>A girl with chestnut hair was facing a well-built boy called out to me.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Sadaoka-kun. Could you step outside for a moment?”</p>
<p>“Huh, President?”</p>
<p>“I need to talk to Kagisaka-kun.”</p>
<p>“I don’t mind he’s staying here. It’s fine if it’s not the two of us.”</p>

<p>When I replied casually, the black-haired student addressed as Sadaoka glared at me.</p>

<p>“Hey, you’re in the same year as me, right? Use honorifics for upperclassmen.”</p>

<p>Whether he was annoyed that I interrupted the confession or not, he closed the distance to show off his strong physique.</p>

<p>(It seems like he does some kind of martial arts.)</p>

<p>Even with the school uniform on, it’s apparent that he keeps his body in shape, and his center of gravity is different from an average person when he’s standing.</p>
<p>From the calluses on his hands, it seems like he’s into striking.</p>
<p>Probably karate.</p>

<p>“It’s alright, Sadaoka-kun.”</p>
<p>“?! B-But, Kaichō!”</p>
<p>“You see, he’s Azusa-chan’s recent new partner. Azusa-chan often helps with the student council’s work, right? So, I thought we’d be working together from now on. That’s why I called him here today.”</p>
<p>“…Ugh. Well, if Kaichō says so…”</p>

<p>As we passed each other, he mumbled, ‘Don’t get carried away.’</p>
<p>After leaving behind a parting remark, Sadaoka left the Student Council room.</p>

<p>Now, only one person remained.</p>
<p>A gentle smile.</p>
<p>If Tomori is lively and charming, this girl is mature and sophisticated.</p>
<p>Her wavy chestnut-colored long hair cascades beautifully. She’s slightly shorter than Chifuyu, but her figure is even more glamorous.</p>
<p>If we were to time travel back to medieval Europe, famous painters would have clamored to have her as a model.</p>
<p>Her elegance and motherly aura make it seem as if she’s a goddess depicted in Western paintings.</p>
<p>She smiles gently with a composed demeanor.</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Don’t play dumb. You came into the Student Council room to help me, right? Since you saw someone confessing to me.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the reason, Kaichō.”</p>

<p>I use her title to tease her a little.</p>
<p>In response, she gracefully loosens her cheeks, showing a hint of composure.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on, don’t tease me like that. Call me like you used to, back in the old days.”</p>
<p>“Is that okay?”</p>
<p>“Of course. You’re my precious little brother, after all.”</p>

<p>Her voice is a little different from the mature tone she used to turn down the confession.</p>
<p>This time, it’s more mischievous and friendly.</p>
<p>The Student Council President of Aisu Gakuin, Seira Hirowatari, from Class 3-A, playfully calls out to me,’ ‘Kay, Kimitaka?’</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>『 Everyone’s friend.』 that’s how Azusa Tomori is called, but Seira Hirowatari also has a nickname.</p>
<p>It’s 『 Everyone’s Admiration.』</p>

<p>As the name suggests, Seira enjoys tremendous support from all the students, and she became the Student Council President in October of her first year in high school.</p>
<p>She also won by a landslide in last year’s Student Council election.</p>

<img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/T25.png" alt="" />

<p>(She’s not like Tomori, excelling in both academics and sports.)</p>

<p>She’s weak in sports, but her academic performance is at the top level in national mock exams.</p>
<p>Moreover, she was born into a prestigious family that has produced prominent politicians for generations, and her father is a foreign minister.</p>
<p>Aisu is a super elite school that attracts the best students from all over the country, and within that, Seira is an unparalleled thoroughbred.</p>

<p>“Do you want some coffee? Don’t you like it?”</p>

<p>However, she smiles warmly in a way that doesn’t reveal any of that background.</p>

<p>“Two sugars?”</p>
<p>“You remember it well.”</p>
<p>“We’ve been friends since we were kids.”</p>

<p>‘You still have a sweet tooth,’ she said in a familiar tone as she brewed coffee.</p>
<p>The Kagisaka and Hirowatari families are very close.</p>

<p>『Make sure to get along with Hirowatari’s daughter.』</p>

<p>I remember my father telling me that when I was a kid.</p>
<p>The Kagisaka family has firmly established its position in the medical industry and holds significant connections in the political and business sectors.</p>
<p>Those connections are what link the Hirowatari family.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Here you go.” my childhood friend offers me a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while since we talked like this face-to-face.”</p>
<p>“…sorry. I——”</p>
<p>“No need to apologize. Your brother’s told me a lot about you.”</p>
<p>“From my brother?”</p>
<p>“‘He’s at a difficult age, so leave him alone.’ he said.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like something he would say…”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you came to see me. You never make any connections at school, right? That’s Kimitaka’s rule, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>On the day I entered this school, when I ran into Seira, I told her that I wouldn’t talk to her like we used to.</p>

<p>(Thinking back, it was a harsh thing to say.)</p>

<p>I’m sure that Seira came all the way to see me because she was concerned about me.</p>

<p>“You’ve changed since you started school, Kimitaka.”</p>
<p>“Have I?”</p>
<p>“You became friends with Azusa-chan and started helping her with her work as her partner. You even came to see me.”</p>
<p>“We exchanged messages on Line sometimes, didn’t we?”</p>
<p>“Every time, I had to initiate the conversation. You hardly ever contacted me first.”</p>

<p>Feeling lonely, Hibiki takes a sip of her black coffee.</p>

<p>“By the way, what do you want?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you earlier? I just wanted to see my cute little brother after such a long time.”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie.”</p>
<p>“You’re being mean. Don’t doubt your big sister.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been fooled enough times by you pretending to be a cat, Seira.”</p>
<p>(TN:猫かぶり, pretending to be a cat, ‘pretending to be’ or ‘disguising oneself as.)</p>

<p>From an outsider’s perspective, Seira seems like a charming person.</p>
<p>She has a warm personality that embraces all students without distinction, and she carries herself with sophistication and maturity.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to her looks and prestigious background, she has quite a few friends, though not as many as Tomori.</p>

<p>(However, everyone has a hidden side they don’t show to others.)</p>

<p>Probably, I’m the only one at this school who knows her true nature.</p>
<p>Seira is more of a little devil than a goddess.</p>

<p>“Fufu, did you find out? “</p>

<p>Her mischievous smile, which she didn’t show in front of Sadaoka, appears.</p>
<p>Seira looks at me with an expression that doesn’t suit the student council president, who is reputed to be a goddess.</p>

<p>“Very good. To see through my act.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you’re getting a little rusty. “</p>
<p>“Maybe. Recently, the student council has been keeping me busy. I haven’t had time to be with the drama club.”</p>
<p>“So you haven’t been onstage recently?”</p>
<p>“Not much. But the student council puts on plays. We put on a puppet show for the nursery school.”</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, Seira always liked making dolls and stuffed animals.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I still do… Oh! I’m working on my favorite one now. Want to see?”</p>
<p>“I’ll pass.”</p>
<p>“A quick response?! Ah, how disappointing…”</p>

<p>Seira’s expression clouded slightly, but she quickly regained her composure with a dazzling smile.</p>

<p>(As usual, she is good at switching facial expressions.)</p>

<p>Seira’s mother is a professional actress who has appeared in major historical dramas and is a veteran with a prominent presence on television.</p>
<p>Influenced by her mother, Seira was also a child actor when she was young.</p>

<p>“First of all, I want to thank you, Kimitaka.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s with the sudden gratitude?”</p>
<p>“You became Azusa’s partner, right? Thanks to you, her burden has significantly decreased. Azusa is like the hero of this school, the white blood cell that rushes to the scene whenever there’s trouble to resolve the situation.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“However, her workload in the past year has become absurd. I was worried that she might burn out and collapse at any moment.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Do you agree, Kimitaka?”</p>
<p>“When you take on more work than you can handle, even adults can lose their ability to make sound judgments. As a result, they might make serious mistakes.”</p>

<p>In late May this year, Tomori tried to solve her classmates’ problems alone, which led to her being trapped in a karaoke room and nearly assaulted by college students.</p>

<p>“Agreed. As expected of my childhood friends, we get along well.”</p>
<p>“Nowadays, Tomori should be fine.”</p>
<p>“You’re thoroughly managing her schedule, right?”</p>
<p>“You know that much?”</p>
<p>“Of course. ‘Everyone’s friend’ finally got a partner, and a boy at that. It’s only natural that it would become the talk of the whole school.”</p>
<p>“People will talk no matter what.”</p>
<p>“By the way…”</p>

<p>As if trying to probe into my thoughts, Seira looked at me with her long eyelashes framing her gaze.</p>

<p>“Are you dating Azusa-chan?”</p>
<p>“No, she’s just a friend.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see. If you had a girlfriend, I thought I could celebrate it for you.”</p>
<p>“Is that what you called me here for?”</p>

<p>As I was about to leave, my pocket vibrated, indicating a new message on my smartphone.</p>
<p>It was a Line message from Seira.</p>

<p>“Open the URL I just sent.”</p>
<p>“I hope it’s not some weird website.”</p>
<p>“It’s a perfectly normal site.”</p>

<p>Curious, I tapped on the URL, and a website titled 『K Prefecture I School Anonymous Bulletin Board Compilation』 appeared.</p>
<p>The top of the page displayed a bulletin board called 『A • T Association of the Defeated Ones. (玉砕者の会)』, which makes me complain.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Hey, Student Council President. What’s healthy about this?”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re right. The thread title might not sound healthy.”</p>
<p>“I mean, something like this actually exists…?”</p>

<p>A•T stands for Azusa Tomori.</p>
<p>The ‘Azusa Tomori Association of the Defeated Ones’ is an online gathering of those who have been rejected by ‘Everyone’s Friend’ Azusa Tomori.</p>
<p>I managed to read the contents of the bulletin board that Seira showed me.</p>

<p>【Why would a gloomy guy like K be A’s partner?】</p>
<p>【Could K be deceiving her?】</p>
<p>【I can’t believe A-chan would fall for a bad guy like him!】</p>
<p>【If that’s the case, does that mean K will dance with her at the prom?】</p>
<p>【If that’s true, we have to stop it at all costs!】</p>

<p>The topics on the bulletin board were all about K, referring to me.</p>

<p>“See? It’s perfectly healthy. This bulletin board is filled with a sense of justice. Everyone wants to protect their beloved Azusa-chan.”</p>
<p>“The problem is that this K refers to me, huh?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“But why use such an outdated forum like an anonymous bulletin board… Wait, maybe because it’s a prestigious school like Aisu, and they want to avoid venting on social media and risking being identified.”</p>
<p>“You’re quite perceptive. With your exceptional intellect, I want you to solve this situation. At the moment, it’s just an under-the-table snide remark, but eventually, this problem will come to the surface.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure it will.”</p>

<p>Azusa Tomori is the hero of Aisuga Academy, and the school relies heavily on her.</p>
<p>So, if a close male friend appears, the whole school won’t stay silent.</p>

<p>“If this continues, the worst-case scenario may happen.”</p>
<p>“I agree. That’s why I want to rely on you, the Troubleshooter’s partner.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be better if Seira did it instead of me? She’s an exceptional student council president. As evidence, she’s won the ‘Aiyu (愛優)’ two years in a row.”</p>
<p>Private Aisu Academy has a tradition that other schools don’t have. It’s called “Aiyu” – they select the MVP-like student once a year.</p>
<p>(TN: 愛 (ai) – means “love” or “affection.” 優 (yu) – means “excellent,” “superior,” or “gentle.” When combined, “愛優” can be interpreted as “loving excellence” or “affectionate and superior.”)</p>

<p>Well, I can understand the reasoning behind it. The school probably wants to fuel the students’ competitive spirit.</p>
<p>For example, one way to strengthen a sports team is to have the players develop a sense of rivalry and compete with each other.</p>
<p>Being aware of their competitors and striving to improve raises motivation for practice and matches.</p>
<p>As a result, their talents are honed.</p>

<p>That’s why Aisu Academy created a trophy for students to compete for.</p>
<p>A school-wide vote decides the “Aiyu” award in December.</p>
<p>It’s based on various activities like end-of-term exams, cultural festivals, and volunteer work.</p>
<p>To increase the number of votes, achieving notable results in school events is essential.</p>
<p>Joining the student council and standing out also helps.</p>

<p>“If I win this year, it’ll be my third consecutive victory. I think there’s only one student in Aisu’s history who achieved a three-peat. Maybe Seira can be the second person to do that.”</p>
<p>“Haha, thanks for the compliment. But wouldn’t it be fun if Kimitaka could become my rival and compete for it?”</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in Aiyu.”</p>
<p>“There are many benefits, you know? Just winning Aiyu alone can get you recommended to top universities in Japan and even abroad. When you enter society, major companies will be fighting to recruit you. And with your top academic performance, Kimitaka—”</p>
<p>“To win ‘Aiyu’, it’s not just about grades; you need popularity, right? In that case, Tomori would be more fitting.”</p>
<p>“…Ugh, I guess you already know that.”</p>

<p>Sighing a little, ‘Everyone’s Admiration’ looked adorable as she pursed her lips.</p>
<p>Tomori’s goal is to help others, not to be recognized with ‘Aiyu’. That’s why she has absolutely no interest in it.</p>

<p>(And besides, she’s just too kind.)</p>

<p>To win Aiyu, you have to compete and fight against your friends.</p>

<p>“I can’t see Tomori participating in the Aiyu contest now.”</p>
<p>“Right? I also can’t see a future where Azusa-chan wins.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say that you will win?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>

<p>After taking a sip of her pitch-black coffee, Seira calmly said,</p>

<p>“I’m not just going to win, I want to overwhelm her.”</p>

<p>With an air of composure, she continued.</p>
<p>“Azusa-chan won’t be my opponent. It seems like she has opened up to you, but she has no other friends to rely on. That kind of personality, she’s hopelessly bad at depending on others, and she always sacrifices her own feelings for others.”</p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>“That’s why she’s in such a vulnerable state sometimes. Just like you were for a while.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t deny it.</p>
<p>Even after I became Azusa Tomori’s partner and helped her with some issues, Azusa Tomori’s major problem remained unresolved.</p>
<p>A lonely hero.</p>

<p>But just because she now had someone she could open up to didn’t mean her loneliness had disappeared.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>If anything——</p>

<p>“The situation where she has only one person she can open up to is more dangerous than not having anyone she can open up to.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s lonely when you’re all alone.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. If someone is there, they can alleviate that loneliness. At first, it might seem like the problem is resolved, but…”</p>
<p>“But if that someone were to disappear, the loneliness would be even more unbearable.”</p>

<p>Yes. Once you’ve experienced not being alone, you can’t bear the loneliness that returns to you.</p>
<p>The reinvigorated sense of loneliness.</p>

<p>“That’s why Tomori needs friends she can open up to besides me.”</p>
<p>“True. If she can overcome that weakness, she might become my rival.”</p>
<p>“You really do evaluate her highly.”</p>
<p>“Of course. We’re really close friends, you know. Last year’s student council election, I even asked Azusa-chan to give a campaign speech for me.”</p>
<p>“But earlier, you said you wanted to win overwhelmingly.”</p>
<p>“As friends, we can see things that others might not. If she can just overcome her weakness of being too kind and able to rely on others, Azusa-chan would be perfect. She excels in sports, academics and has a natural talent for being loved by everyone.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that true for you as well?”</p>
<p>“My communication skills are something I developed later on. I can’t be natural like Azusa-chan. So if she overcomes her weakness, it will be quite troublesome. If, in the future, there comes a time when I have to compete for the ‘Aiyu’ award with her, I’ll have to find some new weaknesses.”</p>

<p>(——Well.)</p>

<p>She does have another weakness.</p>
<p>Kimitaka couldn’t help but recall the image that was uploaded to the secret account last night.</p>

<p>《Holding Hand like Lovers, Lyrics &amp; Composition by tomochan</p>
<p>You, always unsociable~</p>
<p>But I’m the only one who knows~</p>
<p>That you’re actually a kind person~</p>
<p>And I’ll prove it to you~</p>
<p>After school, suddenly hand in hand like lovers~</p>
<p>Our fingers touch, your big palms, your warmth~</p>
<p>Ah~ I like, like-like-like, I like K-kyun~! Woo!</p>
<p>Suddenly acting like lovers~</p>
<p>I can’t help but think that maybe you like me~!</p>
<p>Ah~ I wish this secret love could reach K-kyun~!》</p>

<p>“Kimitaka, don’t you know? Azusa-chan’s weakness.”</p>
<p>“…I don’t have the slightest idea.”</p>

<p>What’s with this stupid lovey-dovey song with lovey-dovey vibes!?”</p>
<p>She even boasted with [Lyrics &amp; Composition by tomochan] as if it’s something to be proud of…</p>

<p>Ah, even if I were to go to heaven tomorrow, I still wouldn’t be able to say it out loud.</p>
<p>Azusa Tomori, whom even the student council president respected, would turn into an unimaginable love-struck fool when it came to her own love life.</p>

<p>“If Kimitaka says so, I’ll believe it. Even though people may see you as a problem child, you’re just as kind as Azusa-chan, and I trust you from the bottom of my heart.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, you want me to solve the issue with the secret site for you?”</p>
<p>“If you do, I’ll talk to the chairman and decline their request for you.”</p>
<p>“Request?”</p>
<p>“The chairman of Aisu Academy loves music. He has already asked Chifuyu-chan to play the piano, but he also wants you to play the violin at the prom.”</p>
<p>“Sure, I used to play, but I haven’t touched the violin since entering high school.”</p>
<p>“You can quickly regain your skills, right? You were among the top performers in the country back then.”</p>
<p>“No way. I absolutely refuse to stand out in front of a large audience.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I’ll talk to the chairman for you. I hope you’ll do me a favor this time, after all, you owe me a favor.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I got it.”</p>

<p>It was true that I owed Seira a favor.</p>
<p>But with her, there had to be something more.</p>

<p>(She must be up to something.)</p>

<p>If Azusa Tomori was the type of genius who excelled in solving things on her own, then Kimitaka’s childhood friend, Seira, was the complete opposite.</p>
<p>She was skilled at moving others and resolving problems like a true mastermind.</p>

<p>” …. “</p>

<p>Is there any clue to figure out her plan?</p>
<p>I wondered as I looked back at the posts on the secret site, I held my breath.</p>

<p>【It’s so irritating. K will probably be in first place again for this final exam, right?】</p>
<p>【Hey, have you heard the rumor?】</p>
<p>【Yeah, they say K’s family background is so good that he makes the teachers change the scores for him, right?】</p>
<p>【Seriously? That’s awful!】</p>
<p>【I wonder if he used his family background to get close to A-chan?】</p>

<p>Kagisaka.</p>
<p>Even though I had left my family’s main house and lived on my own, I couldn’t help but feel bound by that name.</p>
<p>Since I was a child, I had diligently practiced and maintained top grades in school, trying my best to become worthy of the Kagisaka name, yet my father never acknowledged me.</p>
<p>Despite wanting to stand on my own and leave my family behind, I still couldn’t free myself from the shackles of my family.</p>
<p>Confronted with this reality, I couldn’t help but feel uneasy and restless in my heart.</p>

<p>“——I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>A soft whisper echoed in my ear.</p>
<p>My childhood friend had somehow moved behind me and wrapped her slender arms around my neck, hugging me from behind.</p>

<p>“I’m really sorry. I’m sorry I gave you a website with bad things about you, even if it was just to get you a job.”</p>

<p>Ah, shit. I felt pathetic.</p>
<p>I can’t believe I’m being disturbed and worried by the nonsense of people who don’t have the guts to come and complain to me in person.</p>
<p>I felt so embarrassingly inadequate by myself.</p>

<p>“Everything is gonna be okay.”</p>

<p>Just like an older sister comforting her younger brother, Seira gently embraced my body.</p>

<p>“I know that the things written on this site are nonsense.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Kimitaka is a very hard worker. He puts a lot of effort into his studies, extracurricular activities, and interactions with adults. He never relies on his family background to manipulate his grades. Maintaining the top grades is a result of his daily efforts, and I know that very well.”</p>
<p>“Seira…”</p>
<p>“After all, Kimitaka is my proud little brother.”</p>

<p>My childhood friend smiled proudly.</p>
<p>With just that, the unpleasant feelings from earlier vanished.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Since we finally got to see each other, you can lean on your big sister a little, you know?”</p>
<p>“Stop it. If someone sees us, they’ll misunderstand.”</p>

<p>I tried to cover up my embarrassment with a retort.</p>
<p>[Isn’t it fine? With you, Kimitaka, it’s fine even if they misunderstand.], she whispers sweetly, tinged with a hint of shame.</p>

<p>‘Are you kidding me again?’ never left the back of my throat.</p>
<p>The window in front of me reflected Seira’s face, which was tinted with a soft cherry blossom hue.</p>

<p>“——Hey, Kimitaka. With me, how about——”</p>

<p>But before my childhood friend could finish her sentence, the door to the student council room opened.</p>

<p>“Excuse me!”</p>

<p>A knock, and then the door opened.</p>
<p>I meet her eyes as she enters.</p>
<p>For a full five seconds. Silently, we exchanged glances, and then——</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Kagisaka-kun?”</p>

<p>Azusa Tomori spoke to me as the student council president was hugging me.</p>

<p>“Ah, h-hi, Azusa-chan!”</p>

<p>Seira quickly separated from me in a fluster.</p>

<p>(——Now I get it.)</p>

<p>I thought she was hugging me for encouragement, but it seemed like this was her intention.</p>

<p>“E-err, um, please don’t misunderstand?”</p>

<p>A perfect performance worthy of a professional actress.</p>
<p>As her face serves as a canvas, Seira paints a sense of impatience all over her expression.</p>

<p>“I’m not in that kind of relationship with Kimitaka.”</p>
<p>“Huh… K-Kimitaka?”</p>
<p>“I-I usually call Kimitaka by his name. We’re childhood friends, after all.”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>“Ack! S-Sorry? If I say things like that, people might misunderstand my relationship with Kimitaka even more!”</p>

<p>She’s clearly trying to create a misunderstanding!</p>
<p>Seira probably call out Tomori in advance.</p>
<p>And then, she tried to show some scenes of her interacting intimately with me.</p>
<p>Her goal as my childhood friend was to check whether Tomori and I were dating.</p>

<p>——What’s this about [trust me from the bottom of her heart?] She clearly doesn’t believe a word I say.</p>

<p>When I confront her with eye contact,</p>

<p>—Sorry? As your big sister, I just wanted to thoroughly check Kimitaka’s love life.</p>

<p>She conveyed a message blended with seriousness and teasing before resuming her act.</p>

<p>“…there really is nothing between Kimitaka and me.”</p>
<p>“But… you hugged him just now, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Umm, I just wanted to encourage Kimitaka because he seemed a little down.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen Seira-san do something like that to a boy before.”</p>
<p>“I used to do that for Kimitaka when we were kids.”</p>
<p>“O-oh, I see.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Kimitaka and I have always been close. I was just about to invite him too.”</p>
<p>“…Invite him?”</p>
<p>“I mean, dance with me at the prom?”</p>
<p>“Haaaah??”</p>

<p>Her usually charming face is now filled with astonishment, or rather, it’s as if surprise paint has been splattered all over it.</p>

<p>(…What’s going on?)</p>

<p>Isn’t she a bit too surprised?</p>

<p>“…Seira-san, do you understand the meaning of your words just now?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Everyone knows, right? There’s a superstition about the prom. It says that if you dance with someone at the party, you’ll become a couple.”</p>

<p>What’s with that cheesy line you’d find in a romance manga?</p>

<p>Wait, no, this is bad.</p>
<p>The ‘Everyone’s Admiration.’ student council president was my childhood friend.</p>
<p>And now she’s hugging me in the student council room and inviting me to a dance that supposedly makes a pair a couple.</p>

<p>(No wonder Tomori was so agitated.)</p>

<p>If that happens, the fact that Azusa Tomori is in love with Kimitaka Kagisaka will be revealed.</p>

<p>“O-oh, really~? Then you should’ve just said so, Kagisaka-kun!”</p>

<p>But Tomori smiled with an air of composure.</p>

<p>“I’m surprised to know that you and Seira have been friends since childhood!</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah?”</p>
<p>“You’re my partner, you should have told me! “</p>
<p>“Sorry, there wasn’t a good time to bring it up.”</p>

<p>deepzxc&gt;</p>
<p>“You stink of water! This is why you’re a little boy who doesn’t have any friends except me!”</p>
<p>(TN: “水くさい” (mizu kusai). You stink of water!, metaphorically to describe someone’s behavior as being insincere or superficial, much like how water has no distinct smell or taste.)</p>
<p>She smiles at me and hits me on the back with her right hand.</p>
<p>Yet her face shows not the slightest sign of agitation.</p>

<p>“Hmm.”</p>

<p>The student council president looks at the younger student’s face with interest.</p>
<p>Perhaps because we have known each other for a long time, I could read her thoughts from her expression.</p>

<p>——I wonder if she is not in love with Kimitaka, she doesn’t flinch at all.</p>

<p>(I guess you may have concluded so.)</p>

<p>She is so absorbed in observing Tomori’s facial expression that she doesn’t notice that her hand is stuck in the pocket of her red-checked skirt.</p>

<p>Azusa Tomori has a special skill that only I know.</p>
<p>Touch typing.</p>
<p>She can operate a smartphone in her pocket without even looking at the screen.</p>
<p>And what she’s accessing on her phone is…</p>

<p>《——She called K-kun by his first name without honorifics… Seven times…》</p>
<p>” … “</p>

<p>…This is going to be a big problem.</p>
<p>I let out a deep sigh, looking at ‘Everybody’s Friend’, who is full of confidence on the surface but is full of jealousy in secret.</p>
