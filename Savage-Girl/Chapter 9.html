<h2>Chapter 9: Scenario</h2>


<p>“Confession, that was unfortunate.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was after the prom that will likely be talked about for the next few years.</p>
<p>In the student council room, Seira, dressed in pitch-black attire, spoke.</p>

<p>『I like Kagisaka-kun just like everyone else, but I want to remain friends. And it’s not fair to confess your feelings in front of such a big crowd, it feels like you’re pushing through on impulse? If I were to give it a score, maybe it’s 35 points. If I were to be confessed to, I’d prefer a romantic atmosphere when we’re alone.』</p>

<p>That was what Tomori added onstage after she had just cut me off.</p>

<p>“But Kimitaka’s reaction was good.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“『At least it wasn’t a complete failure. I guess I’ll join Azusa Tomori’s Heartbroken Club.』 Didn’t you say something like that? Clearly, everyone’s perspective changed after that. “</p>
<p>“True, that was funny.”</p>
<p>“Of course, and to top it all off, you said, 『Ah, what a shame. I even went as far as playing a violin recording and pretending to play it onstage to make myself look cool.』 He was playing the jester role quite convincingly.”</p>
<p>“You remember every word quite well.”</p>
<p>“Well, even among the third-year students, I have the best grades, you can’t surpass me in excellence. Nobody noticed, but you were actually playing and not using a recording, right? That performance was splendid. I’m sure everything that happened tonight was just as you wanted it to be.”</p>
<p>“Seira, did you figure everything out after all?”</p>

<p>Performing a confession act and getting rejected by Tomori in front of a crowd.</p>
<p>That was my plan. That way, the antagonist on the underground website would be relieved.</p>
<p>Because even though they were rejected by Tomori, many people still couldn’t give up on her.</p>
<p>So, I thought sympathy and camaraderie would gather around me, and it worked out well.</p>

<p>【That guy K got rejected, LOL.】</p>
<p>【But it was amazing, right? Even though the performance used a recording, that confession was truly heartfelt.】</p>
<p>【You can’t confess on a prom stage! Isn’t that common sense?】</p>
<p>【Maybe I’ll allow him to join. Welcome to the A • T Heartbroken Club.!】</p>

<p>The underground website is buzzing with activity.</p>
<p>In reality, my classmates encouraged me, and there were many who praised the courage it took to confess on stage.</p>

<p>(Well, above all else)</p>

<p>The slander and defamation against Chifuyu on the underground website have disappeared.</p>
<p>Tomori and her performed a duet on stage and showed that they reconciled.</p>
<p>Furthermore, thanks to the performance that rivaled professionals, Chifuyu’s evaluation has soared.</p>
<p>As a senpai, I couldn’t be happier.</p>

<p>“Your confession was really good though. I can’t believe someone who hates standing out as much as you do could come up with something like that.”</p>
<p>“I guess.”</p>
<p>“Huh? ‘I guess’… Wait, could it be…”</p>
<p>“That confession was something Tomori and I worked on together.”</p>

<p>It was a collaborative effort we made on the night I stayed over at Tomori’s house.</p>

<p>『I-Is this for real!? Even if it’s a lie, who asks for help with their confession dialogue from the one they’re confessing to?”</p>
<p>『It’s a rational decision. ‘Everyone’s Friends’ is more likely to craft a confession that resonates with the students than I am. Remember, you boasted before? Your Japanese grades were better than mine.』</p>
<p>『That’s true, but…』</p>
<p>『The deadline is tomorrow morning. Come on, let’s do our best, model student. I won’t let you sleep until it’s done. If you doze off, I’ll physically wake you up.』</p>
<p>『You jerk! You really are a true jerk!』</p>

<p>She complained plenty, but she still helped me until morning.</p>
<p>At the same time, I thought it was the best way to cheer Tomori up when she was down.</p>

<p>(It seems like I’m taking advantage of her overly kind nature, but the hero-like ‘Everyone’s Friends’ gets fired up when someone relies on them.)</p>

<p>And… well, you know.</p>
<p>I thought it would be awkward and wouldn’t go well if I tried to come up with a confession dialogue for Tomori on my own.</p>

<p>“I see. By the way, did you also suggest to Azusa-chan that she play a duet with Chifuyu-chan, Kimitaka?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah.”</p>

<p>Based on my experience talking with Chifuyu as a senpai, I knew that she often played duets with Tomori.</p>
<p>I thought that through the performance, she might find a way to reconcile with her.</p>

<p>“Impressive, Kimitaka.”</p>

<p>She said while crafting a perfectly executed smile like a former child actor.</p>
<p>‘Everyone’s Admiration’ starts to weave her words.</p>

<p>“Dealing with the slander against you on the underground site and also addressing Azusa-chan and Chifuyu-chan’s relationship, you’re resolving two problems simultaneously.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Furthermore, you’ve also solved Azusa’s weakness, haven’t you? Azusa-chan and Chifuyu-chan should have become even closer than before, and from now on, Azusa-chan will open her heart not only to you but also to Chifuyu-chan. It’s exactly like the proverbial ‘After the rain falls, earth hardens’! Truly amazing! Everything is going well thanks to Kimitaka—”</p>
<p>” You say that so well, huh? But this whole incident went pretty much according to your scenario, Hiroto-san.”</p>

<p>It was the moment I mentioned a nickname that I had never been used within the academy.</p>

<p>“——You’re truly sharp, as expected, Kei.”</p>

<p>As if responding to her former comrade. The current leader of Kazarina and the girl known as ‘Hiroto’ wore a quiet smile.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“How long have you known that?”</p>

<p>With a remarkably mature attitude, Seira Hirowatari, dressed in a black dress, inquired.</p>

<p>“I had a feeling you were up to something when you asked me for a favor right from the start. It became decisively strange when I met you at the pool.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I also thought it was a little unnatural.”</p>
<p>“Right, it’s a weird coincidence that Seira showed up just when Kazami and I were together, and she was with Sadaoka, who used to bully Kazami in the past.”</p>

<p>Seira probably has a collaborator.</p>
<p>She likely used that person to figure out that Tomori and I, and even Chifuyu, would be going to Yomisaka Land.</p>
<p>Given the circumstances, it’s the only logical conclusion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, using that collaborator—.</p>

<p>“After I became Tomori’s partner, you found out that Kazami was troubled.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“And you decided to use that fact. You intentionally said things that would provoke Kazami, getting her into a fight. And by having Sadaoka present beforehand, I escalated the situation.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Sadaoka is interested in Seira, and he had a history with Kazami. You anticipated that if you manipulated things properly, Kazami would clash with him. Furthermore, didn’t you even predict the scenario where Tomori would stop the fight?”</p>

<p>Of course, this is just one of the storylines Seira came up with.</p>

<p>(She must have prepared many possibilities.)</p>

<p>Among those, she chose the one that best suited the situation and manipulated the stage.</p>
<p>Yes, Seira Hirowatari is the complete opposite of Azusa Tomori.</p>
<p>She moves others with meticulously crafted strategies and honed acting skills to solve problems.</p>
<p>Like a puppeteer controlling a puppet show.</p>
<p>Just as she manipulates puppets with strings, she deftly moves others according to her intentions.</p>
<p>It is this kind of talent that allowed her to take over the leadership after I left Kazarina. Truly, Kazarina’s brain.</p>
<p>Her combat abilities might be low, but it’s okay because there are others who specialize in that area.</p>

<p>“After the rain falls, earth hardens.”</p>

<p>She said that earlier, but Seira’s goal is to break Tomori and Kazami’s relationship once and then mend it. And to create a stronger bond than before. If she does that—.</p>

<p>“Azusa-chan will be able to open her heart to Chifuyu-chan. It’s a rational decision, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Ah… but spreading rumors all around the academy that Kazami and Tomori had a fight, isn’t that going a bit too far?”</p>
<p>“… I was surprised. To think that it was noticed to that extent.”</p>
<p>“The speed at which the rumors spread was excessively fast, no matter how you look at it.”</p>
<p>“You’re truly perceptive, Kei. I don’t want you to misunderstand, but I—”</p>
<p>” I know you weren’t trying to belittle anyone. You wanted to put Tomori’s best friend in a crisis, and you hoped that would make me move even more desperately to save the partner’s best friend.”</p>
<p>“——Everything is correct.”</p>

<p>Applause resonated, like offering praise.</p>

<p>“I had a lot of other plans to patch things up, but I’m glad you’re on board.”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk nonsense. You should have been convinced that I would definitely move.”</p>
<p>“Kimitaka is kind, after all. As the student council president, I just wanted to solve the problems that the academy’s hero faced. Azusa-chan had no friends she could open her heart to except you. It would have been a major issue for Aisu Academy if she had collapsed.”</p>
<p>“But is it really okay for the student council president to engage in these covert activities?”</p>
<p>“You’re equally guilty, aren’t you, Troublemaker-kun? You perfectly saw through my plan yet didn’t expose Azusa-chan and Chifuyu-chan. Instead, you used them to make them reconcile.”</p>
<p>“That is…”</p>
<p>“It’s a cool-headed judgment to the point where I want to hug and praise you immediately. Hey, Kei? Why don’t you come back to Kazarina? The whole team misses you. Of course, I miss you the most.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“As a childhood friend, as the student council president, as the leader of Kazarina, I sincerely believe this. Your intelligence is too precious to let smolder away at the academy.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Hiroto-san.”</p>

<p>I can’t go back to Kazarina.</p>
<p>Even if everyone on the team forgives me, I can’t forgive myself.</p>
<p>For the mistakes I made, the ones Kei made. And besides—</p>

<p>“Right now, I am Azusa Tomori’s partner.”</p>

<p>I state it clearly.</p>
<p>Upon hearing my answer, Seira seems to accept it, nodding with a gentle expression.</p>

<p>“Got it. But if you ever feel like coming back, just let me know, okay? We’ll give you a grand welcome. Big sis will be happy to have you back.”</p>
<p>“I’ll keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>“By the way… sigh. Azusa-chan is so lucky. To have Kimitaka feel this strongly about her. I’m so jealous.”</p>
<p>“Then how about you settle it with a fight?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Are you suggesting a duel for Aiyu’s sake? Like I said before, Azusa-chan—”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Tomori will… No, she’ll become Seira’s opponents soon.”</p>
<p>“What…!?”</p>

<p>For the first time today, Seira’s expression falters.</p>
<p>She realized that my words are an unmistakable declaration of war.</p>

<p>“I see. I didn’t predict this development.”</p>
<p>“You said it’s a waste to let me smolder away at the academy, but from now on, it won’t be so easy.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, Kimitaka. Tonight has been quite eventful, and it’s a pity I couldn’t dance with you at the prom…”</p>

<p>‘I’m sure there will be more exciting things to come.’</p>
<p>‘Everyone’s Admiration’ said with a gorgeous smile on her face.</p>
