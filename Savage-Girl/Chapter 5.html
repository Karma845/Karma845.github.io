Sleepover Girls’ Talk 1</strong></p>

<p>“It’s not a date. We’re just going out to have fun.”</p>

<p>On a Sunday.</p>
<p>Azusa, dressed in light peach-colored pajamas, nails me just after I get out of the bath.</p>

<p>“This is normal for friends.”</p>
<p>“Again with that? When a high school boy and girl go out together, it’s a date…date will solve everything!!”</p>
<p>“That’s another line from an anime or manga, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Azusa said after blow-drying my hair.</p>
<p>Today, Chifuyu Kazami’s schedule involves staying overnight at Tomori House.</p>
<p>I’ve often stayed in this apartment since long ago, so it doesn’t feel special at all.</p>
<p>But what we’re talking about might be quite special.</p>

<p>“Come on, at least confide in your best friend like me. You like Kagisaka, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“No, of course not.”</p>
<p>“Why not invite him on that date later and say, ‘Let’s dance together at the prom!’ ?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, who would want to dance with such a dull youth?”</p>

<p>While forcing a smile, Azusa hugged a small dog plushie in the room.</p>
<p>I know her well; Azusa has this habit. When she’s feeling down, she hugs her favorite plushie.</p>

<p>(It’s not that she hates the idea of a date, right?)</p>

<p>I wonder… is there a reason she can’t invite Kagisaka to the prom?</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Hm? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been having some trouble getting online.”</p>
<p>“Is there a communication problem, maybe?”</p>

<p>Azusa placed her red smartphone beside her bed.</p>

<p>“By the way, why did you choose tickets as a thank-you gift?”</p>
<p>“Nothing special. I just wanted to push you forward and help you out once in a while. You’ve been taking care of me all the time, after all.”</p>

<p>Azusa and I have been friends since elementary school.</p>
<p>Back then, I was an introvert and sometimes bullied.</p>

<p>『Everything will be fine, Chi-chan!』</p>

<p>At such times, Azusa Tomori was the one who helped me.</p>
<p>She called me by a nickname that is not used anymore and then protected me.</p>
<p>Even though Azusa had many friends at that time, I was her closest one.</p>

<p>(I was so happy to become the best friend of [Everyone’s Friends].)</p>

<p>It felt somehow special.</p>
<p>My shy personality didn’t change until middle school.</p>
<p>I spoke to everyone, including Azusa, in polite language.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why until high school, Azusa was the only friend I had…</p>

<p>“I’m really thankful that Azusa always noticed me and helped me.”</p>
<p>“Chifuyu has helped me in various ways too.”</p>
<p>“Oh? When?”</p>
<p>“Like teaching me piano when we were kids.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah, we used to play piano duets together.”</p>
<p>“Even the fact that I’m involved in the activities I am now, it’s because of Chifuyu.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. When you helped me back then, you said, ‘I like that part of you, like a hero!’ didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“There were times like that too…”</p>

<p>Though my way of speaking is different from how it used to be… I feel like I said that.</p>
<p>It was when Azusa saved me from being bullied at the city park.</p>

<p>——But.</p>

<p>I feel like there were others who helped me at that time, besides Azusa.</p>

<p>“You don’t remember?”</p>

<p>Azusa puffed up her cheeks in a sulky gesture.</p>
<p>Seeing that, I couldn’t help but want to pat her head.</p>
<p>Ah, that Kagisaka guy is such an unexpected character.</p>
<p>How could he not fall in love with such an adorable Azusa?</p>

<p>“It was a long time ago, you know.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess it’s been about ten years.”</p>
<p>“I’ve become more respectable compared to those days, okay? I’m no longer the same as I used to be.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, I never thought you’d become a gal.”</p>
<p>“Right? So, Azusa, you should…”</p>

<p>I wanted to say, ‘Rely on me more,’ but stopped.</p>

<p>(Sadly, I can’t be Azusa’s partner.)</p>

<p>Azusa and I have been childhood friends.</p>
<p>But… it’s not an equal relationship.</p>
<p>As evidence, I’ve been helped by her all the time.</p>
<p>Even in the music room the other day, she comforted me when I was crying.</p>

<p>(I can’t count the number of times I’ve cried in front of Azusa.)</p>

<p>But I have never seen her shed tears. Azusa is that strong.</p>
<p>A model student that excels in both academics and sports, [Everyone’s Friend].</p>
<p>It’s inevitable that no matter how hard I try, I can’t have an equal relationship with her.</p>
<p>Believing that, I’ve been covering up my feelings of inferiority, always being helped by Azusa.</p>

<p>(But…)</p>

<p>Kimitaka Kagisaka.</p>
<p>He became Azusa’s partner.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it makes my heart ache terribly.</p>
<p>Surely, Kagisaka is a special presence to Azusa, even more than I am——</p>

<p>“By the way, are you really okay with it?”</p>
<p>“With what?”</p>
<p>“Me going out to play with Kagisaka-kun. Chifuyu, you hate Kagisaka-kun even more than before.”</p>
<p>“That’s exactly why.”</p>

<p>Maybe if Azusa and Kagisaka were dating…</p>
<p>I might be able to blow away these feelings.</p>

<p>“If you were dating… I might not completely dislike Kagisaka.”</p>
<p>“Chifuyu…”</p>
<p>“Don’t get me wrong!? I’d admit it, but only a little! I still get irritated and hate it when Azusa gets along well with him!”</p>

<p>What’s irritating me is…</p>
<p>I don’t like this weak side of me that feels bothered about their relationship.</p>

<p>(Yeah, that’s right.)</p>

<p>I thought Kazami Chifuyu changed after meeting Senpai.</p>
<p>No longer the shy girl with only Azusa as a friend and skilled at playing the piano, and nowhere near a proper lady.</p>

<p>“I also want to be myself and put an end to these feelings.”</p>
<p>“——I see. It’s not like you hate Kagisaka-kun that much.”</p>
<p>“What!? There’s no way that’s true!”</p>

<p>I absolutely hate loners like him!</p>
<p>He ignored me all the time, kept rejecting my invitations to become otaku friends, and yet, he became Azusa’s partner…</p>
<p>There’s nothing redeeming about him!</p>

<p>[Why don’t you just ask your crush directly? Say, ‘Do you have a girlfriend?’]</p>
<p>But instead, the words he said in the music room resurfaced in my mind.</p>
<p>I think Azusa has changed him.</p>
<p>Before, it would have been unthinkable for him to give me advice. And besides…</p>

<p>(… Why does it have to be like that?)</p>

<p>Kagisaka’s serious expression as he gave me advice.</p>
<p>For some reason, his appearance overlaps with the Senpai I met the other day.</p>
<p>I didn’t get to hear ‘I like you better’ that night.</p>
<p>Still, the time I spent with Senpai remains vividly etched in my memory——</p>

<p>“Chifuyu?”</p>
<p>“Um… Anyway, Azusa? Shall we sleep in the same bed tonight?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it too small for that?”</p>
<p>“We used to do it all the time, so it’ll be fine!”</p>
<p>“Well, it can’t be helped.”</p>

<p>She nodded with a smile, even with such a sudden request.</p>
<p>Seeing my best friend like that, I think…</p>

<p>(Azusa is probably just as important to me as Senpai.)</p>

<p>That’s why, even though I feel sorry for Azusa, I will never become friends with Kagisaka.</p>
<p>He helped me the other day, but I should have already repaid the favor by giving him the tickets.</p>

<p>(Of course, I know Kagisaka isn’t a bad guy.)</p>

<p>He’s someone whom my childhood friend and partner recognized.</p>
<p>I fully understand that fact, but——</p>

<p>“Hehehe, it’s still cramped, huh?”</p>

<p>After turning off the room lights, in the dim light, Azusa chuckled shyly.</p>

<p>(——Well, whatever.)</p>

<p>When I saw Azusa’s smile, I felt like nothing else mattered.</p>
<p>Kagisaka probably hasn’t seen this expression of hers yet.</p>

<p>“Hey, Azusa.”</p>
<p>“What’s up?”</p>
<p>“If Azusa asks Kagisaka to dance and he rejects you, then I’ll punch him on your behalf.”</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s something I could never have imagined coming from the old Chifuyu.”</p>
<p>“I told you, I’ve changed. Besides, if Kagisaka won’t dance with you, then how about dancing with me?”</p>
<p>“Me and Chifuyu?”</p>
<p>“I can’t leave my best friend alone at the party. And the prom’s jinx doesn’t work for same-sex pairs, right?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, you might be right.”</p>

<p>On the single bed, we laugh together at the small distance between us.</p>

<p>(How about it, Kagisaka?)</p>

<p>You probably couldn’t do something like this, could you?</p>
<p>Indeed, you and Azusa became friends.</p>
<p>You’ve managed to establish a connection with someone, something you’ve been refusing all this time.</p>

<p>(But… even I——)</p>

<p>I’m connected to Azusa. Longer, stronger, and deeper.</p>
<p>Satisfied with that, until sleep comes, I decided to exchange trivial conversations with my best friend, just a few centimeters away.</p>
