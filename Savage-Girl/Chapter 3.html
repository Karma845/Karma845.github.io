<p>【It’s sudden, but can I come to Azusa’s apartment today?】</p>

<p>Sunday, 12:56 PM.</p>
<p>I received a message on my smartphone from my childhood friend, Chifuyu.</p>

<p>【The exams start tomorrow, right? But I can’t seem to concentrate on studying alone. Want to study together?】</p>
<p>【Sorry, I have something to do today.】</p>
<p>【Are you going somewhere?】</p>
<p>【Yes.】</p>
<p>【With Azusa’s mom?】</p>
<p>【No, Mom has been in France for about three weeks since yesterday. She’s participating in a patissier competition.】</p>
<p>【Hmm, then Azusa will be home alone for a while… Ah! Does that mean you’re going out with Kagisaka!?】</p>
<p>【There’s no way that’s happening.】</p>
<p>【Ugh! Whatever, I don’t care! If you’re going to put a guy over your best friend, then I’ll spend time with the person I like too! We have this social game we play, and there’s an amazing event costume we need to discuss!】</p>
<p>【I’m telling you, I’m not going out with Kagisaka-kun.】</p>

<p>..Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess I wasn’t lying?</p>
<p>It’s not like we’re going somewhere.</p>

<p>“!”</p>

<p>Immediately after that, the intercom rang.</p>
<p>After releasing the auto-lock on the front door, I returned to my room and checked my outfit in the mirror.</p>

<p>(..Did I go a bit overboard?)</p>

<p>A summery off-shoulder pure white blouse.</p>
<p>A short, red flared skirt.</p>
<p>It feels like I’m putting in the effort as if going on a date, but that analogy is completely off.</p>

<p>I take a deep breath to calm down my heart that’s been pounding since last night.</p>
<p>Just as the door chime rang, I opened the front door.</p>

<p>“I’m surprised. You’re here on time.”</p>

<p>Trying to hide my embarrassment, I unintentionally let out a grumble.</p>

<p>“I’ve never been late before.”</p>
<p>“I see, you value punctuality but have a twisted personality.”</p>
<p>“Meeting someone and immediately being rude. Is that the Tomori family’s way of greeting?”</p>
<p>“Correct. Surprised?”</p>
<p>“Rather, I feel relieved. It’s better than being attacked out of nowhere.”</p>
<p>“Huh? You’re not mistaking my house for a lion’s cage or something, are you?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous. It’s more like a gorilla than a lion.”</p>
<p>“Gorilla…!?”</p>
<p>“If you can’t stand it anymore, feel free to drum your chest out, okay?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, maybe I’d rather bang your side of the head instead of my chest~.”</p>

<p>A playful exchange of teasing remarks.</p>
<p>Just a typical, everyday conversation.</p>

<p>“Come on, hurry up and come inside.”</p>

<p>However, what’s about to begin is an extraordinary event.</p>

<p>Kimitaka Kagisaka.</p>
<p>On a sunny Sunday in July, I invited a male classmate to my house when no one else was around.</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>“It’s kinda late to ask, but…”</p>

<p>Studying at the table, Kagisaka-kun says while sitting on the cushion in my room, which I had carefully tidied last night.</p>

<p>“Was there a need to study at Tomori’s house?”</p>
<p>“I explained the reason, didn’t I? We always used to study at Hoshimiya Coffee. Going to a café every time isn’t budget-friendly.”</p>
<p>“Why not study in the classroom or the library then?”</p>
<p>“If someone sees us studying together, strange rumors will spread. That’s why I reluctantly… suggested studying at my house. Anyway, it’s normal for friends to do this kind of thing.”</p>

<p>That’s a lie.</p>
<p>To be clear, it’s not normal at all.</p>

<p>(I couldn’t sleep properly last night.)</p>

<p>I tried to change my mood, so I went to the nearby convenience store at night.</p>

<p>《This isn’t normal at all! It’s like a house date with K-kun!》</p>
<p>《I need to buy various things, just in case!》</p>
<p>《Wait… 0.01mm… Isn’t that too thin? I probably won’t even use it with 99% of probability… But what if I do, and it tears? What should I do, K-kun!?》</p>

<p>Along with these anxious tweets from my secret account, I ended up buying various things.</p>

<p>(Calm down.)</p>

<p>I hid those items in my desk drawer, and there’s no way I’ll actually use them. </p>
<p>The reason I invited him over was that I wanted to get closer to him. All of this… is for that reason.</p>

<p>“…It’s all Kagisaka-kun’s fault.”</p>

<p>As I solved the problem sets, my thoughts accidentally slipped out of my mouth.</p>

<p>“Huh? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Ah, um… I mean I’m helping you with your studies. I’m afraid you’re going to fail this semester.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t the student council president’s childhood friend busy with prom dance practice?”</p>

<p>Ah, no. Stop, me.</p>

<p>“But I was surprised. Kagisaka-kun and Seira-san are really close, huh?”</p>

<p>This is just an unreasonable act of anger. </p>
<p>Since the day we had that conversation in the student council room, I haven’t been able to control my emotions.</p>

<p>“Could it be that you two are already dating?”</p>

<p>I blurted out something I was too scared to ask. That scene is still vivid in my mind.</p>
<p>Seira-san is embracing Kagisaka-kun in the student council room. </p>
<p>At that moment, they looked just like a couple.</p>

<p>(…I could never do something like that. Even today, I ended up saying mean things as a way to hide my embarrassment.)</p>

<p>After Kagisaka-kun left the student council room, he said that he and Seira were just childhood friends…</p>

<p>《…Idiot.》</p>

<p>I murmured into my phone, which I had put in my pocket.</p>
<p>If you had a childhood friend, you should have told me. After all, we’re partners…</p>

<p>“Let’s talk about that later.”</p>
<p>“Uh, where are you going?”</p>
<p>“I was studying at the café before coming here, but I seem to have forgotten a reference book. I’ll go get it.”</p>

<p>As soon as he said that, Kagisaka-kun left the room.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, I heard the sound of the front door opening and closing.</p>
<p>It seems like he really went outside.</p>

<p>“…What should I do? Did I make him angry?”</p>

<p>It’s not surprising. He came all the way to my house to study, but I said something so sarcastic…</p>

<p>“…I’m such an unpleasant person today…”</p>

<p>A heavy sigh of self-loathing escapes me.</p>
<p>Spending time with the boy I like.</p>
<p>In a shoujo manga, the probability of a romantic comedy event would be 100%, but it seems like reality isn’t that romantic.</p>

<p>“…Seira-san would probably never act like this.”</p>

<p>I understand because we’re friends.</p>
<p>Seira-san is a truly charming person.</p>
<p>She’s the student council president called the ‘Everyone’s admiration’ and does things that I could never do.</p>

<p>(That’s why she won the Aiyu Award two years in a row.)</p>

<p> </p>


<p>Though I never aimed to win the Aiyu Award, and I’m not good at the idea of competing with my academy friends.</p>

<p>“But…”</p>

<p>I remember Seira-san being awarded in the auditorium last year.</p>

<p>『Thank you. I’m really happy to have won Aiyu Award two years in a row, and I will work hard to achieve my goal of winning the Aiyu Award three years in a row.』</p>

<p>She looked so radiant on stage as if it was only natural for her to be called ‘Everyone’s admiration’.</p>

<p> 《S-san would never say mean things to hide her embarrassment, that’s for sure.》</p>
<p> 《Like S-san, if I work hard towards my goal, would K-kun start to like me?》</p>
<p>《But I don’t have any goals other than helping others…》</p>

<p>Even if I tweet about it on my secret account, my sadness won’t go away.</p>
<p>If he were asked which one he’d choose as his partner, I’m sure Kagisaka-kun would choose Seira-san.</p>
<p>If they became a couple, being at home together might not just be about studying. </p>
<p>Maybe the things I bought today would be put to use.</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>I imagined them embracing each other on the bed in their natural state (naked), and my tears almost welled up.</p>

<p>“No, don’t get depressed!”</p>

<p>Without resorting to sarcasm, I should ask Kagisaka-kun properly. </p>
<p>They might really just be childhood friends, after all!</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>I noticed it right then.</p>
<p>A black smartphone is under the table.</p>
<p>It belongs to Kagisaka-kun.</p>

<p>“Did he forget it?”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but pick it up and gaze at it.</p>

<p>(…I wonder what his lock screen is?)</p>

<p>He mentioned that he likes dogs, so maybe it’s a picture of his family’s Sakura-chan?</p>

<p>“Or… maybe it’s me?”</p>

<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I’m surely going overboard with my imagination.</p>
<p>Even I wouldn’t do something so embarrassing.</p>

<p>(Well… I almost did.)</p>

<p>The other day when we were studying at Hoshimiya Coffee, I secretly took a photo of Kagisaka-kun in his casual clothes. </p>
<p>He was seriously solving the problem sets, and it was such a cute moment.</p>
<p>I repeatedly looked at the photo in my room, giggling. And before I knew it, I almost set it as my wallpaper.</p>

<p>“!?”</p>

<p>An incoming call.</p>
<p>On Kagisaka-kun’s smartphone screen, there was a notification from a chat app. </p>
<p>Startled, my fingers accidentally touched the notification——</p>

<p>“Ah, Senpai!?”</p>

<p>I was even more surprised.</p>
<p>The voice coming from the speaker was undoubtedly that of a girl.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.</p>

<p>Who is this person?</p>

<p>“Hehe, thanks for picking it up! Sorry? I really wanted to talk to you… so I called you on the spur of the moment!”</p>
<p>“Um, he’s not here right now…!”</p>

<p>It was just a reflex response barely two seconds later.</p>

<p>“——Wait. Who are you?”</p>

<p>The friendly tone from before was gone.</p>
<p>Instead, there was a freshly squeezed, 100% genuine hostility.</p>

<p>“Why do you have Senpai’s phone?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m… I’m his friend.”</p>

<p>Maybe I’m being mistaken for a thief or something.</p>
<p>I wanted to explain and clear up the misunderstanding, but… I don’t know, this voice sounds something like I’ve heard it somewhere before.</p>

<p>“Oh, really? Even if you’re friends, isn’t it rude to answer someone’s call without permission?”</p>
<p>“Well, you see…”</p>
<p>“Wait, are you some kind of stalker following Senpai!?”</p>
<p>“What!? Why would you think that!?”</p>
<p>“Senpai is popular, you know. It wouldn’t be strange if there’s a weird girl peeking into his phone.”</p>
<p>“I really am his friend! As proof, we’re studying together at home right now——”</p>
<p>“——Home?”</p>

<p>Ah-no, I stepped on a landmine!</p>
<p>The moment I heard her voice trembling with anger, I realized my mistake.</p>

<p>“Did you just say ‘Home’?”</p>
<p>“Err…”</p>
<p>“You’re at Senpai’s house?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that. This is… my house.”</p>
<p>“Huh, I see. So you forced him to come there.”</p>
<p>“Wait, why are you treating me like the bad guy——”</p>
<p>“Shut up, you naughty home-wrecking bitch!”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that nickname too harsh!? And what’s with this reaction…”</p>

<p>Wait, could it be? This girl… does she know Kagisaka-kun?</p>

<p>“…I let my guard down. I never thought Senpai would attract a bug…”</p>
<p>“B-bug!? I’m not….!”</p>
<p>“But too bad for you! I’m definitely closer to him! We were together all night yesterday!”</p>
<p>“What!? You mean…!”</p>
<p>“We were playing online games together until dawn!”</p>
<p>“…ah, I see, playing games.”</p>

<p>I’m relieved it wasn’t something strange.</p>
<p>However, my suspicions have turned into certainty.</p>

<p>(This girl is one of Kagisaka-kun’s online otaku friends.)</p>

<p>And undoubtedly!</p>
<p>This girl also likes Kagisaka-kun!</p>

<p>“——Just to let you know, it’s not just that!”</p>

<p>I’m sure she saw me as a love rival.</p>
<p>Like a territorial cat, she’s biting me over the phone.</p>

<p>“We also talked about this season’s anime and discussed our favorite characters!”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>

<p>Alright, let’s stay composed.</p>
<p>Calling Kagisaka-kun ‘Senpai’ probably means she’s younger than me.</p>
<p>Even if she’s a love rival, I need to show the composure of someone older.</p>

<p>“And, it’s not like we always talk about otaku stuff! The other day, when we had a video call, Senpai complimented my casual outfit!”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>

<p>O-okay, let’s calm down.</p>
<p>Even if she’s a love rival, I must maintain my composure…!</p>

<p>“We talked about various things that night.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“We were on the call for a good three hours. But it wasn’t boring at all. The next day, Senpai sent me a DM saying he was happy to talk with me after a long time.”</p>

<p>I heard a snap in my mind.</p>
<p>Something like rationality, patience, or my pride as someone older broke.</p>

<p>“O-Oh, really〜? That’s interesting〜.”</p>

<p>Uh-oh, my hand holding the phone is trembling uncontrollably.</p>

<p>But, I can’t stop now, can I?</p>
<p>If it were about something else, I wouldn’t get so angry, but when she blatantly tries to assert her dominance over Kagisaka-kun, I can’t just stay silent, can I?</p>

<p>“You’re pretty close~.”</p>
<p>“Hmph. Isn’t that obvious?”</p>
<p>“But, I’m also pretty close to him, you know?”</p>
<p>“Ha?”</p>

<p>Alright, did I catch her off guard?</p>
<p>Without missing a beat, I start my counterattack.</p>

<p>“I gave him bento three times a week!”</p>
<p>“!? W-wait, that’s…”</p>
<p>“The other day, we even held hands like a lover!”</p>
<p>“…ah!”</p>
<p>“And, you know… he’s even seen my underwear before!”</p>
<p>“Whaaat!?”</p>

<p>A deafening scream comes through the speaker.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>(W-well, I’m not lying.)</p>

<p>It’s true that when a strong gust of wind caught me, Kagisaka-kun saw what was inside my skirt.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that!?”</p>

<p>I’ve got her now!</p>

<img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/T26.png" alt="" />

<p>There’s no way she can beat me in this argument!</p>
<p>However, it’s a secret that I’ve been fighting with Kagisaka-kun every day!</p>

<p>Wait, she’s going crazy… No, wait? More like half crying——</p>

<p>“I-I like him… I’m definitely the one who understands him the most…”</p>

<p>Half crying? No, she’s actually bawling!?</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>Even though I launched a preemptive attack, I can’t help but feel sorry for her…</p>

<p>“!?”</p>

<p>The intercom rang.</p>
<p>It seems like the owner of the smartphone has returned.</p>

<p>“Sorry! I’ll hang up now!”</p>
<p>“Ah, wait——”</p>

<p>After ending the call, I deactivates his phone.</p>
<p>I greet Kagisaka-kun again at the entrance.</p>

<p>“Welcome back.”</p>
<p>“? … uh, what’s going on?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Your face looks tense.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.”</p>

<p>I can’t exactly tell him that I was having a heated argument with his Otaku friend.</p>

<p>“Hey, Kagisaka-kun?”</p>

<p>After returning to my room, I ask, trying to suppress my nervousness.</p>

<p>“Is there something you’re hiding from me?”</p>

<p>The person you were talking to on the phone earlier seemed quite close to you.</p>
<p>Perhaps, she’s your girlfriend. If that’s the case…</p>

<p>“You’ve got a keen sense.”</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>“The truth is, there’s something important I need to tell you about, Tomori.”</p>
<p>” …ah.”</p>

<p>The tears that were about to overflow before the call threatened to spill again.</p>

<p>(…No, don’t cry.)</p>

<p>During the incident in May…</p>
<p>In the park at night, I ended up crying in front of Kagisaka-kun, and I didn’t want to show such an embarrassing side of myself anymore.</p>

<p>(That’s right. Even if Kagisaka-kun has a girlfriend…)</p>

<p>I should smile and congratulate him properly. That’s what I, his friend, should do.</p>

<p>“Tomori has many friends. I thought it might come out sooner or later even if I kept quiet.”</p>

<p>However…</p>
<p>The story he opened up about completely differed from what I had imagined.</p>

<p>#</p>

<p>Azusa Tomori’s room.</p>
<p>After picking up the forgotten smartphone earlier, I show the screen to Tomori.</p>

<p>” …!?”</p>

<p>Her adorable expression contorts with shock.</p>
<p>The accessed page on the smartphone is the infamous underground site’s bulletin board.</p>
<p>Yes, one of the reasons I came to her house today was to talk to Tomori about this bulletin board.</p>

<p>『Worst-case scenario.』</p>

<p>My prediction in the student council room was not wrong.</p>
<p>Azusa Tomori is too kind.</p>
<p>If she were to find out about the existence of this underground site, she would undoubtedly try to help me.</p>

<p>(If that happens, the situation will definitely escalate into a quagmire.)</p>

<p>People around me will be strongly aware that Kimitaka Kagisaka is very special to Azusa Tomori.</p>
<p>If things go wrong, Tomori might not be able to remain ‘Everyone’s friend.’</p>
<p>That would be troublesome.</p>

<p>『Azusa-chan is like the hero of this school, a white blood cell that rushes to the scene whenever there’s trouble to resolve the situation.』</p>

<p>Seira had said, but it’s easy to imagine what happens when a body loses the vital white blood cells that fight against viruses.</p>

<p>(The current Aisudepends heavily on a person named Azusa Tomori.)</p>

<p>Just like the planets in the solar system revolve around the sun, if ‘Everyone’s friend.’ were to disappear, the school would lose its momentum.</p>
<p>And…</p>

<p>“It’s going to be okay.”</p>

<p>As I expected, Tomori smiled to reassure me.</p>

<p>“I’m really sorry, Kagisaka-kun.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>Why are you apologizing? You don’t need to.</p>

<p>“My friends got you into trouble because of me. But I want you to understand it’s not your fault. The one at fault is me for not realizing everyone’s feelings.”</p>

<p>No way that’s true.</p>
<p>As always, you’re too kind.</p>

<p>“You see, it’s just online harassment for now, but if I leave it alone, it could escalate into real-life harassment. So, I’ll handle it somehow. Kagisaka-kun, you don’t need to do anything.”</p>

<p>It’s like a reliable, warm sun shining on me.</p>
<p>Now, I finally understand why Tomori got so many consultations.</p>
<p>With this perfect smile, anyone can’t help but want to rely on her.</p>
<p>I feel like leaning on you.</p>

<p>(But, I must never do that.)</p>

<p>What happened when so many people relied on Tomori unilaterally?</p>
<p>May.</p>
<p>Tomori, who was abducted to a karaoke room, was hit with a stun gun, forcibly stripped of her uniform, and almost assaulted by multiple men.</p>

<p>『…I’m sorry, Kagisaka-kun. I caused you trouble. I’m really sorry.』</p>

<p>Even after I rescued her, she kept apologizing with tears in her eyes, as if she bore all the responsibility.</p>
<p>That hoarse voice of my partner from that moment is still etched in my eardrums. That’s why——</p>

<p>“Don’t try to handle everything alone.”</p>

<p>I need to pour my feelings out to Tomori.</p>

<p>“Are you going back to how you were before we teamed up? Treat me more like your partner.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“What happened to your usual sharpness? Remember what you said to me in class earlier about not being alone?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Lean on me a little.”</p>

<p>I urge her gently.</p>
<p>Surely, in Tomori’s mind, the feeling of solving things alone during the incidents still lingers.</p>
<p>People can’t change easily.</p>
<p>But—gradually, she can change.</p>

<p>“I’m not good at relying on others either.”</p>

<p>I had a hard time getting along with my family, ran away from home, distanced myself from my old friends, and avoided any connections with others at school.</p>

<p>Not creating connections with others.</p>
<p>That was Kimitaka Kagisaka’s rule.</p>

<p>(Of course, I thought confiding in classmates about my feelings was impossible.)</p>

<p>That’s why, now.</p>
<p>——I also need to take a step forward.</p>

<p>“There are two people who are bad at relying on others right here. That’s why let’s think of a way together.”</p>
<p>“But! That would be a bother to you——”</p>
<p>“You idiot. There’s no way it’d be a bother. I’m actually happy that I can be of help to you, Tomori.”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>

<p>Because I straightforwardly expressed my feelings, Tomori seemed unusually surprised.</p>

<p>(Oh, even I’m surprised.)</p>

<p>For me, who had rejected connections with others, to say such words… But——it’s all thanks to Tomori.</p>
<p>Thanks to her, I was able to change just a little bit.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>Well, I must admit that expressing such emotions was a bit embarrassing…</p>

<p>“Tomori, you should also rely on others a little. It’s okay to be a bit selfish. Don’t prioritize helping others all the time; it’s better to be honest with your own feelings.”</p>
<p>“My own feelings…”</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking this for a while, but you show your weaknesses to others too little.”</p>
<p>“Huh, don’t act all high and mighty! You don’t show your weaknesses either!”</p>
<p>“It’s not that I never showed my weakness to anyone. I used to rely heavily on my family.”</p>
<p>“Huh? But you have a bad relationship with your family…”</p>

<p>At that point, Tomori seemed taken aback.</p>
<p>My partner’s expression clouded, seemingly a bit sad.</p>

<p>“As expected, is it Seira-san?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not. Though it’s true she’s more like family than a friend. However, she’s more likely to be taken care of than she’s taken care of by me. Like I said before, we’re not dating or anything like that.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I swear.”</p>

<p>I wanted to ease my partner’s worries even a little, so I asserted confidently.</p>

<p>“Seira is just a childhood friend.”</p>
<p>“But if that’s the case, who do you rely on?”</p>
<p>“Sakura.”</p>
<p>“A dog!?”</p>
<p>“Even a pet dog can be an important family member. When I felt down, I used to cuddle with Sakura a lot. Hugging her felt so comforting and soothing.”</p>

<p>Sakura was a pure white Great Pyrenees, a big, fluffy dog that was incredibly warm and comforting.</p>

<p>“So, you see, I’ve relied on others too.”</p>
<p>“…Wow, you’ve only relied on a pet dog for comfort. A true, purebred loner…”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to hear that from you, the honor student who has many friends but can’t rely on others.”</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>“I can lean on Sakura, but you can’t rely on anyone, Tomori. Isn’t that more like being a loner?”</p>
<p>“What!? Loner…!”</p>
<p>“So, if you’re having a hard time, you can rely on me, Loner-san.”</p>
<p>“…!?”</p>

<p>Tomori glared at me with her usual sharp look.</p>
<p>However, her expression soon softened.</p>
<p>She couldn’t hold back a chuckle. “Fufu…”</p>

<p>“Calling me a loner, huh? You’re the first one to throw such an insult at me.”</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to our daily battle.”</p>
<p>“I’m not happy about it. You’re the only one who speaks so openly to me like this, Kagisaka-kun.”</p>

<p>That’s a significant issue that Azusa Tomori carries, but for now, let’s put it aside.</p>

<p>“…Well, you know…”</p>

<p>Restless, like a lost Shiba Inu, Tomori squeezes out her words with a faint voice.</p>

<p>“Can I, just for a little, rely on you?”</p>
<p>“Sure, anything——”</p>

<p>I was about to say, ‘Anything you want,’ but then I remembered the secret Twitter account tweet I saw this morning.</p>
<p>…You’re not going to ask me to do that, are you?</p>

<p>“Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>” …no. At this point, you can ask me anything. If there’s anything I can do, I’ll make it happen.”</p>

<p>Alone together in my classmate’s room, the unusual situation accelerates the beating of my heart.</p>

<p>“Got it.”</p>

<p>While nodding, Tomori shyly averts her gaze.</p>
<p>Her smooth and translucent skin blushes a shade of crimson… Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Could it be that she really wants to engage in such an act——</p>

<p>“——I want you to hold me.”</p>

<p>Her tiny mouth earnestly squeezes out a rather modest request.</p>

<p>“Huh? Is that all you want?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I read in a book once that being held by someone increases feelings of happiness and security.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I know similar information.”</p>

<p>It was written in a medical book I had at home.</p>
<p>When you hug, various substances are secreted in the brain.</p>
<p>Dopamine, which humans feel when they experience happiness.</p>
<p>Oxytocin, believed to have stress-relieving and relaxing effects. Obtaining these hormones can soothe one’s feelings.</p>

<p>(She must be shocked by the hurtful comments from her friends on that secret website.)</p>

<p>I see. She wants to heal those wounds with a hug.</p>
<p>Or maybe, after seeing Seira interacting with me in the Student Council room, she feels jealous.</p>
<p>Thinking about it that way, she looks kind of cute.</p>

<p>“You also hugged Sakura-chan to find solace, didn’t you? So, please, just for now, can you be my dog?”</p>
<p>“Don’t say such crazy things!”</p>

<p>I take back what I said earlier.</p>
<p>Not cute at all.</p>
<p>Even if her hidden feelings are revealed on her secret account, the real Tomori is not the least bit honest.</p>

<p>“…well, it can’t be helped. There’s no one else I can rely on for something like this except you. So…take responsibility, okay?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“If you ever feel down, you can rely on me too. So, just this once, will you grant my wish? ‘If you’re having a hard time, you can rely on me.’ Those words came from you, Kagisaka-kun, and it’s because of you that I feel this way…that’s why…”</p>

<p>Looking up at me with shy eyes, Tomori earnestly confessed.</p>

<p>(Ah, seriously…)</p>

<p>That’s unfair.</p>
<p>She just treated me like a dog a moment ago.</p>
<p>If she comes at me with such an adorable plea… I can’t possibly refuse.</p>

<p>“Alright.”</p>

<p>Slowly, I walked up to Tomori, who was standing in front of me.</p>
<p>Suppressing my nervousness, I wrapped my arms around her back.</p>
<p>I quietly embraced her delicate, slender body that was more than 10 cm shorter than mine.</p>

<p>“…!”</p>

<p>In my chest, I felt Tomori take a small gasp.</p>
<p>Seemingly embarrassed, she pressed her forehead against me, as if trying to hide her face.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, I couldn’t read her expression, but…</p>

<p>“Hey, Honor Student-san.”</p>
<p>“What? Troublemaker-kun.”</p>
<p>“You’re way too nervous.”</p>
<p>“What? I’m not—”</p>
<p>“Your body is so tense.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>“I feel like hugging a mannequin.”</p>

<p>Is this supposed to be comforting? Isn’t it making her more nervous and exhausted?</p>

<p> </p>


<p>(What should I do in situations like this?)</p>

<p>Back in middle school, I used to listen to people’s problems a lot, but this is the first time I’m doing something like this.</p>
<p>Seira or my older brother would probably handle it better.</p>
<p>I don’t have their level of social skills.</p>
<p>If it were Sakura instead…</p>

<p>“Oh, right. Um, Tomori? Can I touch your ear?”</p>
<p>“——Ha?”</p>

<p>Without making eye contact, Tomori spoke in a tone as cold as curry left out overnight.</p>

<p>“Huh, this I didn’t know.”</p>
<p>“Wait——”</p>
<p>“Are you changing jobs from Loner Boy to Ear Fetish-kun?”</p>
<p>“Don’t label my preferences on your own. I just want to help you relax, Tomori. There are various pressure points in the ears.”</p>
<p>“…you’re going to give me a massage?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. When I touched Sakura’s ears, she seemed to enjoy it.”</p>
<p>“A dog and a person are different…”</p>
<p>“Just leave it to me. I also studied massages for humans from a book at home.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t mind. It’s not a big deal to have my ears touched. Besides, I didn’t expect much from an amateur like you.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>With his left hand, he continued to embrace Tomori.</p>
<p>With her right hand, touch her little left ear.</p>

<p>“Nnhh.”</p>

<p>As I stretched her well-shaped ear, a somewhat sultry sigh escaped Tomori’s lips, but I continued the massage.</p>

<p>“Ahh…”</p>

<p>① I slowly massaged and loosened her ear.</p>
<p>“Haaanh…”</p>

<p>② Then I pressed a pressure point on the backside of her ear with my thumb, applying a little more pressure.</p>
<p>“W-wait…”</p>

<p>③ Finally, I gently covered the whole ear with my palm and then rotated it.</p>
<p>“Ka, Kagisaka-kun…uu”</p>
<p>“Did it hurt?”</p>
<p>“It’s not, but…”</p>
<p>“Well then, should I continue?”</p>
<p>“Eh, wait!!?”</p>

<p>Then I repeated steps ① to ③.</p>
<p>After finishing her left ear, I moved on to the right ear.</p>
<p>I thought she might resist, but Tomori tightly gripped my shirt with her small hands and allowed me to continue.</p>

<p>“~~~uu”</p>

<p>Every time he touched her ear, she desperately suppressed her voice, and her spine trembled faintly, squirming slightly as if feeling a jolt throughout her body.</p>

<p>(It feels like we’re doing something wrong…)</p>

<p>A sense of immorality welled up, but there was still more to go.</p>
<p>Perhaps the massage worked; the stiffness seemed to leave Tomori’s body.</p>

<p>“Is it over…?”</p>

<p>When I stopped touching her ear, Tomori let out a faint sigh as if reluctant to part.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about? I haven’t completed the essential step.”</p>

<p>And thus.</p>
<p>With both arms, I embraced Tomori’s slender waist, which was now devoid of strength.</p>

<p>“…!?”</p>

<p>Her fragile and tender body tensed up once again.</p>
<p>However, it was just for a moment.</p>

<p>“Kyaa…!?”</p>
<p>Her voice blended with surprise and exclamation.</p>
<p>The strength seemed to drain away from her body.</p>
<p>“Somehow… my body feels warmer than before.”</p>
<p>“That’s probably because Tomori’s body temperature has risen. I think the ear massage helped you relax, improving the overall blood circulation.”</p>

<p>Though it sounds like an excuse, that guess about Tomori is probably accurate.</p>
<p>One good thing about this position is that Tomori can’t see my face. Because I’m pretty sure my face is turning red as if I have a fever.</p>

<p>(Well, can’t be helped, I guess?)</p>

<p>With both arms holding her tightly, Tomori’s ample and soft chest presses gently against my body.</p>
<p>The warm body temperature of a girl sends warmth throughout my entire body.</p>
<p>Moreover, the beating of her heart. It’s impossible not to be conscious of this situation.</p>

<p>“Somehow, I might be getting used to it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, when I think about it, I used to do this a lot with friends after winning basketball or softball games.”</p>
<p>I tried it, and it’s not a big deal after all,” she said in a casual tone, leaving me feeling a bit frustrated.</p>

<p>(…It’s kind of irritating.)</p>

<p>It’s not like I have feelings for Tomori, but I’m so conscious of her, and yet she takes such a casual attitude.</p>

<p>“!?”</p>

<p>Suddenly, I heard the sound of the intercom.</p>

<p>“Ah… it’s probably the delivery!”</p>

<p>Before I could say anything, Tomori quickly moved away from my body and left the room.</p>
<p>She rushed out as if she was escaping.</p>

<p>“Could it be that she finds me annoying?”</p>

<p>Maybe she thought I was hugging her too long for no reason.</p>

<p>But, oh well.</p>
<p>She’s ‘Everyone’s friend.’</p>
<p>Unlike me, she’s used to skinship with others.</p>

<p>《It’s totally different from hugging a friend!》</p>

<p>However…</p>

<p>《My face is hot, my whole body feels warm, my mind is all fuzzy and floaty, and I’m melting! Omg, getting my ear touched was dangerous, but being embraced feels way too good~!》</p>

<p>tomochan’s inner thoughts are revealed in her private account.</p>

<p>《I want to go back quickly! I want to hug you again!》</p>

<p>She’s probably tweeting by the entrance after receiving the package,</p>

<p>《K-kun〜〜〜I want you to do it again~!》</p>

<p>“Are you a spoiled stray dog that constantly seeks affection?”</p>

<p>You’re wagging your tail with all your might where no one can see.</p>
<p>At least be more honest in reality. This kind of thing is just not cute.</p>

<p>《Ahh, K-kun, I really love you.》</p>
<p>《I didn’t know. Being embraced by someone you love makes you feel this happy~~.》</p>
<p>《Ah, having this secret account is truly great. I can vent my feelings here, and K-kun won’t find out about my emotions.》</p>

<p>“…Idiot.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I know everything.</p>
<p>It’s been obvious for a long time.</p>


<p> </p>


<p>“Sorry for making you wait… uh, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Why is your face so red?”</p>
<p>“It’s because of hugging you. Tomori, your body temperature is unusually high.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… hmmm.”</p>

<p>Tomori peeks at my face with a sly smile, teasing me.</p>

<p>“Did it feel good to hug me, by any chance? “</p>
<p>“… How is that possible?</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“What about you?”</p>
<p>” What about me? It wasn’t that effective, I guess.”</p>

<p>Liar!</p>

<p>Should I show you the tweet you posted earlier?</p>
<p>You act all composed, thinking you haven’t been found out, but your true feelings are like full-frontal nudity, you know?!</p>
<p>Unaware of the struggle you’re desperately holding back.</p>
<p>Tomori’s demeanor on her secret account is the complete opposite, and when she looks like this…</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s that time already…”</p>

<p>I feel like teasing her.</p>

<p>“I think it’s time to go home.”</p>
<p>“Huh?!”</p>
<p>“I guess hugging didn’t seem to have much effect.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s true, but…”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I couldn’t be of any help.”</p>

<p>As I put my study materials back into my bag and try to leave the room…</p>

<p>“Wait!”</p>

<p>Tomori grasped the edge of my shirt with her right hand, holding me back gently.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Well, um… that…”</p>
<p>“If you don’t have anything to say, I’m going to leave.”</p>
<p>“Uh…!”</p>

<p>Blushing with embarrassment, Tomori timidly looks up at my face.</p>

<p>“…I’ll give you one more chance.”</p>
<p>“A chance?”</p>
<p>“Yes. A chance to hug me. Are you grateful? It’s too pitiful to go home without achieving anything, right? So——”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>Immediately, I dropped my bag to the floor and embraced Tomori’s body tightly.</p>

<p>“Hyahh!”</p>

<p>The surprise attack was a success.</p>
<p>A faint, delicate scream echoed in my arms.</p>

<p>(Oh no, this is bad.)</p>

<p>Her reactions are just too cute.</p>
<p>I feel possessive somehow, and I don’t want anyone else to see this side of the exemplary ‘Everyone’s friend.’</p>
<p>For now, I want to keep this all to myself.</p>

<p>“Hey, wait, all of a sudden…!”</p>
<p>“If you don’t like it, I’ll stop. But I’ve been thinking about it for a while now. I’m the one always hugging you, but you never hug me back.”</p>
<p>“Well, that may be true, but…!”</p>
<p>“Could it be that you actually enjoyed being hugged by me?”</p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>
<p>“I see. You were just savoring the moment without moving?”</p>
<p>“That’s not true!”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Of course not! Your hugs don’t mean anything to me! So…”</p>

<p>With cautious movements, as if she’s hugging a wild wolf, Tomori wraps her slender hands around my waist.</p>

<p>“…there you go, I did it.”</p>
<p>“Good job.”</p>
<p>“What’s with that? Such a pompous reaction. Also…”</p>

<p>Tomori hesitates and doesn’t finish her sentence.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Well, um… Can you be a little… stronger?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I couldn’t hear you, your voice was too quiet.”</p>
<p>“!? You’re really mean! You definitely heard me!?”</p>
<p>“I really didn’t hear you. Please say it more clearly.”</p>

<p>After saying that, I felt a bit guilty for teasing her too much.</p>
<p>Tomori’s cute reactions make me want to tease her even more.</p>

<p>(Well, as expected, she can’t do it.)</p>

<p>Even though Tomori is completely open on her secret account, she’s not good at showing her real self in reality.</p>

<p>“…More.”</p>

<p>For a moment, I thought my phone had accidentally read out Tomori’s secret account tweet.</p>
<p>But it’s different.</p>
<p>Tomori’s white cheeks are dyed with embarrassment, and she murmurs in a whispering voice.</p>

<p>“…Please. Hug me more.”</p>

<p>As if pleading, she embraces my body with her delicate arms.</p>

<p>“——Leave it to me.”</p>

<p>In response, I tightly embrace her waist.</p>
<p>It’s warm.</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/T27.png" alt="" />

<p>Even though the air conditioning is working normally, I can’t help but feel hot.</p>
<p>It’s like there is summer inside me, and now, I can hear it more clearly.</p>
<p>Tomori’s heartbeat.</p>

<p>A fast-paced melody echoing like a bell.</p>

<p>(Come to think of it, she mentioned it on her secret account.)</p>

<p>She said she didn’t plan on confessing until I confessed first. But…</p>

<p>(This is just like a confession, isn’t it?)</p>

<p>That’s how high Tomori’s heart was beating.</p>
<p>No, wait, maybe it’s my own heartbeat that’s racing…</p>

<p>“Hey, Kagisaka-kun…”</p>

<p>Suddenly, while our bodies were close, Tomori spoke up.</p>

<p>“Do you have a girlfriend…?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Why are you asking out of the blue?”</p>
<p>“Just answer me.”</p>
<p>“There’s no way I do. You should know well how limited my social circle is.”</p>
<p>“Are you not dating one of your otaku friends you mentioned before?”</p>
<p>“We get along, but we’re just friends.”</p>
<p>“I see. Well, that’s good then. There are many things to consider from now on.”</p>
<p>“Is this related to a way to solve secret-site issues?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right. So, I need you to focus more on our work together than on romance. You and I will resolve the situation together. Don’t forget that, my partner.”</p>

<p>Her expression remains unreadable as always.</p>
<p>However, even so…</p>

<p>In my heart, I felt Tomori was beaming with happiness.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>A later story, or rather, a point of reflection.</p>
<p>It was about a week after that skinship, right after the final exams ended.</p>

<p>“Wow! Azusa, you did great! Second place again!”</p>
<p>“And you’re only five points behind Kagisaka, who’s at the top!”</p>

<p>At Aisu, after the final exams’ grading was finished, they posted the names and scores of the top-performing students in the hallway.</p>
<p>Of course, like at Aiyu, it’s part of the effort to encourage a sense of competition among the students.</p>

<p>(I managed to hold on to the first place somehow.)</p>

<p>As many students looked at the list, I took a breath of relief in my heart.</p>

<p>“Ehehe, thanks, everyone!”</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Azusa! Now that the tests are over, let’s go hang out!”</p>
<p>“How about joining the sports club after school today?”</p>
<p>“Wait, don’t rush me!”</p>
<p>“Today, Tomo-chan and I are having a karaoke party!”</p>
<p>“Oh, um, not necessarily today, but how about playing board games? Actually, there’s a game I really want to recommend to Tomo-chan!”</p>

<p>As expected of ‘Everyone’s friend.’</p>
<p>While I’m alone looking at the results, Tomori is surrounded by various students, from extroverted guys to introverted girls.</p>

<p>【Did you hear? A-chan, she’s just 5 points behind K and got second place!】</p>
<p>【Damn it. K is in first place again.】</p>
<p>【But Kengosan, her grades were even better than usual, right?】</p>
<p>【She must have studied a lot, even on her days off.】</p>
<p>【I think she can beat that K guy soon!】</p>

<p>Even on the underground site’s bulletin board, the anti-fans are celebrating…</p>

<p>(I absolutely can’t let her find out about us.)</p>

<p>“Ah, Kagisaka-kun.”</p>

<p>Tomori notices me and starts talking to me, and I try to look nonchalant before I say.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s my win again.”</p>
<p>“What?! Don’t act all high and mighty just because of a five-point difference! My Japanese score was much better than yours.”</p>
<p>“A win is a win. Well, I’ll humiliate you again next time.”</p>
<p>“Sorry not sorry. Next time, I’ll win. I’ll sink you into the bottomless abyss of defeat.”</p>

<p>Bleh.</p>
<p>Ignoring Tomori, who playfully sticks out the tip of her bright red tongue, I start walking away.</p>

<p>(Alright, I managed to talk without blushing.)</p>

<p>To be honest, it wasn’t just Tomori that felt good about that day.</p>
<p>Having not met Sakura for over a year, Kimitaka Kagisaka also had the desire to hug someone.</p>
<p>Because of that, I let my guard down.</p>

<p>『Tomori, you smell nice.』</p>
<p>『What?! Why are you suddenly…!』</p>
<p>『You smell just like Sakura.』</p>
<p>『Wait, do you know about ‘sabaori’? It’s a sumo torture technique where you tighten the body with both arms. Shall I try it on you now?』</p>
<p>『Wait, that’s not what I meant. I didn’t mean it smells like a dog or anything.』</p>
<p>『Then, what do you mean?』</p>
<p>『It’s a pleasant scent. When I dried Sakura’s hair after washing it in the bath, it had a scent just like this. Also, the way your hair feels fluffy is similar to Sakura’s…』</p>
<p>『…Want to try touching?』</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>『Just kidding. I wouldn’t let a troublemaker like you pat my head.』</p>
<p>『I wouldn’t want to engage in such embarrassing play, either.』</p>
<p>『As expected of the troublemaker. Your manners are terrible.』</p>
<p>『It seems that the only one that is getting warmer is your tongue.』</p>
<p>『My body is a bit chilled because of the air conditioning. So, could you warm me up a little more?』</p>

<p>One hour.</p>
<p>That was the time when Tomori and I exchanged trivial conversations while embracing each other.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the minute hand had completed a full circle on the clock.</p>

<p>“…Sigh.”</p>

<p>…I really went too far, didn’t I?</p>
<p>I sigh as I walk down the hallway.</p>

<p>(We learned that standing while hugging for a long time is tiring, so we sat on the bed together and embraced for about 30 minutes.)</p>

<p>During the test, memories of our embrace flashed through my mind, making it hard to focus on solving the problems.</p>
<p>As a result, I almost lost the top position.</p>

<p>(In that regard, as expected of an honor student.)</p>

<p>Unlike me, who was in terrible shape, Tomori was able to concentrate perfectly on the test.</p>
<p>That’s probably why her scores improved.</p>

<p>《Kyaa~〜〜〜〜》</p>

<p>However, Tomochan’s muttered words were straightforward.</p>

<p>《Ugh, I can’t take it anymore! After talking with K-kun, I couldn’t hold back!》</p>
<p>《I want to hug him~! Thanks to that day, I was able to do my best on the test more than usual!》</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>So Tomori was able to turn the hug into power.</p>

<p>(…It’s strange.)</p>

<p>Just thinking back now makes me feel embarrassed, and I’m frustrated that my scores dropped.</p>
<p>But knowing that Tomori was able to do her best because of me… it warms my heart, just like when we hugged.</p>

<p>(Well… if there’s another chance, I wouldn’t mind hugging her again.)</p>

<p>For this past week, I’ve been missing that warmth so much that I keep watching the old video of Sakura.</p>
<p>It’s like being in a hug-loss state, just like Tomori…</p>

<p>《Sigh. If I died, I’d want to be reborn as K-kun’s dog.》</p>

<p>I had to hold back a laugh as I walked down the hallway.</p>

<p>《I envy you, Sakura-chan.》</p>
<p>《You could receive hugs every day… I can be kissed every day and even have my head stroked… Ahh, on that day, I was too embarrassed and refused, but I wish I had let him pat my head!》</p>

<p>I take back what I said earlier!</p>
<p>I’d never pat Tomori’s head.</p>

<p>《Ahh, being a dog is too much, but how about trying on this costume?》</p>

<p>This time, I burst out laughing.</p>
<p>It was a tweet that Tomori retweeted on her secret account.</p>
<p>It was the SSR card illustration from the gacha game Chifuyu and I played together.</p>

<p>Commonly known as “Avant-garde Dog.”</p>
<p>With dog ears, a tail, and a collar. Moreover, the heroine was dressed in a fluffy outfit with very little fabric coverage.</p>

<p>《『As expected of my partner, you understand my preferences well!』He might praise me for it~!》</p>

<p>What do you think I’m into?</p>
<p>While thinking that, I can’t help but imagine it.</p>
<p>Azusa Tomori dressed in the Avant-garde Dog outfit.</p>

<p>(No way.)</p>

<p>That’s just too…</p>

<p>《I better not!》</p>
<p>《Thinking rationally, this outfit is quite… lewd!》</p>
<p>《I don’t know, the ‘just friends’ magic won’t work now…!”》</p>

<p>As expected of my partner.</p>
<p>She was thinking the same thing as me.</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/T28.png" alt="" />

<p>No matter how you look at this outfit, it’s definitely crossing the line as just friends.</p>

<p>《My goal of becoming someone that K-kun could like hasn’t changed.》</p>
<p>《But I can’t let our friendship collapse because I went too far.》</p>
<p>《I finally became friends with K-kun.》</p>
<p>《I have various worries, but just that alone makes me quite happy.》</p>
<p>《Just that alone… makes me happy, hufft.》</p>

<p>While gazing at my smartphone, I contemplate.</p>

<p>Indeed, I have various worries.</p>
<p>By hugging, I managed to prevent Tomori from going out of control due to the hidden site issue, but the situation wasn’t fully resolved.</p>
<p>Still, I promised to support Tomori, and she started to rely on me a little more.</p>

<p>I think it’s something to be happy.</p>
<p>I finally made a connection with a fellow classmate that I had been rejecting.</p>
<p>But having connections doesn’t only bring benefits.</p>
<p>As a downside, although I successfully defended the top spot, my test scores dropped.</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s really difficult.”</p>

<p>Human relationships are complicated.</p>
<p>With a wry smile, I decided to take this reflection to heart.</p>
<p>I’ve come to realize that I won’t become Tomori’s boyfriend.</p>
<p>Just by hugging, my grades suffered.</p>

<p>《It’s a little scary. Just by hugging, I’m already this happy. If we were to become lovers, I wonder what would happen?》</p>
<p>“…I feel the same.”</p>

<p>If, hypothetically, I were to start dating Tomori and engage in hugging or more intimate acts, I feel like I was going to lose something beyond studying.</p>
