<h2>Chapter 10: Just for Tonight</h2>


<p>“You’re late, Bocchi-kun.”</p>

<p>After leaving the academy. I had come to the park where I had met Chifuyu before in the form of Kei.</p>
<p>Tomori had called me to tell me that he had something to tell me.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“That’s unusual. You apologizing so sincerely. Are you hiding something, by any chance?”</p>
<p>“How could I? “</p>

<p>As expected of the hjonor student, your mind is quick.</p>
<p>I can’t say that I was called out by Seira. Otherwise—</p>
<p>—Huh? Were you with Seira-san?</p>
<p>—Could it be, you were seeking comfort from me after being rejected?</p>
<p>—What’s going on, partner?</p>
<p>If that happens, Tomori’s bright red dress she’s wearing might get even redder, perhaps stained with my blood.</p>

<p>“More importantly, what did you want to talk about?”</p>

<p>Even though I say that, I already have a pretty good idea of what Tomori wants to say.</p>
<p>After all, I saw her secret account before coming here.</p>

<p>《I’ve been thinking all along about what kind of person I need to become for you to like me, K-kun…》</p>
<p>《Thanks to C-chan, I found the answer.》</p>
<p>《You mentioned it before too, K-kun. You said you like girls who work hard toward their goals. You said you’d like to see me working hard toward a new goal!》</p>
<p>《So, my plan is to become the most loved student in this academy. He might start liking me if I work hard to achieve that goal!》</p>

<p>And also…</p>

<p>《Tuxedo K-kun is way too precioussss!》</p>
<p>《What’s with the violin? It looked so cool, seriously! Tonight, the supply of K-kun content is endless》</p>
<p>《Even though it’s a lie, the fact that I got confessed to… Tomoho——I totally recorded everything on my phone, so it’s gonna be K-kun TIME every night from now on》</p>

<p>There were tweets like these, but for now, let’s put that aside.</p>
<p>Goal. That is to say…</p>

<p>“I want to win Aiyu.”</p>

<p>Tomori, in her dress, declared with a serious tone as if she were confessing.</p>

<p>“Did something change your mind? Weren’t you disinterested before?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, actually…”</p>

<p>And at that moment, my pocket smartphone vibrated.</p>
<p>After quickly checking the screen, it seems that I received a DM from Kouhai-chan.</p>

<p>“Kagisaka-kun?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing. Please continue.”</p>
<p>“Understood. Thanks to Kagisaka-kun, I was able to make up with Chifuyu. And, after the prom, Chifuyu also ask me for something.”</p>
<p>“You mean about giving the piano competition another shot?”</p>

<p>『When I was in 9th grade, I wanted to play the piano well enough to win a competition. That desire was so strong that I couldn’t play the kind of music I truly wanted to. But tonight’s duet made me remember the joy of playing the piano!』</p>

<p>Through the duet with Tomori, she must have managed to overcome the doubts she had about playing the piano.</p>

<p>“Chifuyu at that time looked so radiant. I’m sure a new goal was born for her – the desire to play the piano joyfully at another competition.”</p>
<p>“I feel the same way.”</p>
<p>“See? That’s why I wanted to have a goal too. Didn’t Kagisaka-kun mention at the pool that he wants to see me win Aiyu? As your partner, I want to help fulfill your wish.”</p>
<p>“Is that okay? Aren’t fellow students at the academy like friends to Tomori?”</p>

<p>The previous Tomori wouldn’t have had the thought of competing against her friends.</p>
<p>Instead, she would have wished for someone to win Aiyu and even cheered for them.</p>

<p>“My way of thinking has changed a bit. Not just to help someone else but to fulfill my own wishes too. And if that means I have to fight, even against a friend, I’m willing.”</p>
<p>“Wishes, huh?”</p>
<p>“Kagisaka-kun also told me that I should be more honest with my feelings, right? So… please. I want you to lend me your strength—”</p>
<p>“Got it. I’ll support you with all my might to help Tomori win Aiyu.”</p>

<p>When she bluntly hit me with a sincere request, Tomori’s eyelids fluttered like a Corgi who had just spotted an extra-large bone on the roadside.</p>

<p>” …I’m surprised. You agreed so easily.”</p>
<p>“Was it unexpected?”</p>
<p>“Did you undergo personality correction therapy at the Kindness Factory?”</p>
<p>“If there’s such a delightful treatment, I’m recommending it to you first.”</p>
<p>“Great! That wickedness! The usual Kagisaka-kun!”</p>
<p>“And you’re the usual trifecta of sarcasm, foul language, and verbal abuse, you foul-mouthed Queen.”</p>

<p>I deflect any further probing with my usual lighthearted banter.</p>
<p>While Tomori said she wants to win Aiyu, Seira, who’s currently on a two-time winning streak, is a formidable opponent.</p>
<p>As former comrades, I know all too well how tough she can be.</p>
<p>Tomori, who is friends with Seira, must also be well aware.</p>

<p>(That’s why, from now on, she’ll rely on Chifuyu and even more people.)</p>

<p>By doing so, the issue of Tomori not having many friends she can open up to will gradually be resolved.</p>
<p>Seira mentioned that Tomori started opening up to Chifuyu after this incident, but that alone isn’t sufficient.</p>
<p>That’s why I proposed that Tomori and Chifuyu play a piano duet.</p>
<p>Through the duet, Chifuyu’s troubles might find a solution.</p>
<p>I hoped that Tomori, her best friend, would also be influenced by this.</p>

<p>(Of course.)</p>

<p>I wasn’t foreseeing the unfolding of events as perfectly as Seira did.</p>
<p>It was simply hope.</p>
<p>Still, after hearing her inner thoughts so much on her secret account, I felt like Tomori would meet my expectations.</p>
<p>And then—</p>

<p>I want to let my partner, who responded to my hopes, win.</p>
<p>The lonely hero who has always only thought about helping friends has resolved to aim for a goal, even if it means fighting against a friend.</p>
<p>I want to support her as her partner.</p>
<p>So—some portion of the confession I told Tomori tonight is undeniably the true feelings of Kimitaka Kagisaka.</p>

<p>(It’s not like I’m copying Seira’s words, but…)</p>

<p>I didn’t dance with anyone at the prom.</p>
<p>But in the future that lies ahead, I’m sure there are exciting events that will make my heart race waiting—</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way. Would you like to dance a bit?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“As a sign of reconciliation, I danced with Chifuyu at the prom. But Bocchi-kun, you were in the corner eating, weren’t you?”</p>
<p>“You’re observant.”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you regretting not inviting me to dance while being mesmerized by me in my dress?”</p>
<p>“Hey, you say the dumbest things sometimes.”</p>

<p>Though I tried to brush it off, she hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but be fascinated by Tomori, who looked stunning in her deep red dress.</p>

<p>“It’s so pitiful that you were alone even on prom night with your grayish youth. I have no choice, I’ll make some memories for you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly.”</p>
<p>“Come on, it’s a dance… well, don’t just suddenly put your hand on my waist!”</p>
<p>“It’s a dance, so what can you do…”</p>
<p>“Ugh…I just hope you don’t step on my feet, Troublemaker-kun.”</p>
<p>“I understand, Honor Student-san.”</p>

<p>Under the moonlight, in a deserted park at night, we slowly mark our steps.</p>

<p>“You’re quite a good dancer.”</p>
<p>“You’re not bad either.”</p>

<p>Her face, so close to mine, seems to be slightly flushed in the moonlight.</p>
<p>I might even start thinking she practiced dancing for me… but that’s probably just from reading too many tweets on her secret account.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Speaking of which…”</p>

<p>Matching our breaths and swaying our bodies, we waltz together.</p>
<p>Tomori parted her cherry-colored lips.</p>
<p>Maybe because her face is so close that we can touch, I can’t help but feel nervous.</p>

<p>“Thanks for tonight.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s with the sudden gratitude?”</p>
<p>“Well, Kagisaka-kun… you helped me out, after all. Thanks to you, the issue with the underground site was resolved, and I reconciled with Chifuyu.”</p>
<p>“Could it be that dancing like this to color my youth is your way of saying thank you?”</p>
<p>“It might be something like that.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, quite a cheap reward. I even confessed, you know.”</p>
<p>“It was a 35-point confession, though.”</p>
<p>“For me, that’s pretty impressive. If you’re saying that much, how about showing me an example?”</p>

<p>I blurted out a joke in response to her teasing.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s absolutely no chance that Tomori would confess to me.</p>

<p>——Being confessed to by me.</p>
<p>That was Tomori’s purpose revealed in her secret account.</p>
<p>Knowing Tomori’s clumsiness in romance, she’s surely falling silent out of embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Huh? I knew you couldn’t do it.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll do it!”</p>


<p>High school, second year, summer, prom night. Right at the very end, I would come to know.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve changed to the point where I’m saying phrases I’ve resolved never to say. But it wasn’t just me who changed within the days we spent together. Tomori is also changing——</p>

<div><img src="https://animestuff.me/Senki/0016_T33.png" alt="" />

<p>Suddenly, Tomori’s lips met mine. Just a momentary kiss, a mere touch.</p>
<p>However, the sensation of her soft lips remained inexplicably—</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think?”</p>

<p>While still holding hands with me.</p>
<p>Tomori smiled with a somewhat triumphant expression.</p>

<p>“Hey, just now—”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you the one who told me to show you an example? I’d give that confession a perfect score of 100 points. We’re alone, and it felt properly romantic.”</p>
<p>“But, just now—”</p>

<p>As I was about to say,</p>

<p>‘You kissed me?’ I was about to say, but Tomori placed her index finger on my lips as if silencing my words.</p>
<p>And then, her expression, no longer the confident smile from earlier, was tinged with bashfulness.</p>

<p>“…It’s normal for friends to kiss.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“You said it earlier, right? About making memories. Just like the dance tonight, this kiss is also just a thank-you.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“It’s not like I kissed you because I like you or anything. Don’t misunderstand a simple kiss… Hey, Kagisaka-kun? Why are you silent?”</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>“Could it be… you were too happy to be kissed by me?”</p>

<p>Tomori gazes at me with eyes filled with a certain expectation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this wasn’t a situation where I could savor happiness.</p>
<p>At this moment, Tomori hasn’t been tweeting on her secret account.</p>
<p>Though her face remains composed, she’s gripping my hand tightly as if suppressing the embarrassment from her kiss.</p>


<p>(I don’t know what’s inside Tomori’s heart…)</p>

<p>However, I can perfectly predict the inner thoughts of the one person other than Tomori.</p>
<p>I remember a DM from Kouhai-chan that I had just received.</p>

<p>【Please listen, Senpai! I’m watching how my childhood friend’s romance will unfold! Two high schoolers in the park at night… They’re confessing, right?】</p>

<p>Speculative, but after the prom, Tomori found a reason to separate from Chifuyu.</p>
<p>But suspicious Chifuyu secretly followed her friend—</p>

<p>“Congratulations, Azusa.”</p>

<p>She had been hiding in the bushes of the park.</p>
<p>After witnessing the decisive scene, she revealed herself to congratulate her friend.</p>

<p>“Uh, Ch-Chifuyu!?”</p>

<p>Tomori was completely taken aback, having no knowledge of anything that had happened.</p>
<p>Chifuyu, with her elegant silver hair and pure white swaying dress, stood before her friend.</p>

<p>“So, you lied about rejecting that confession after all.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“To protect Kagisaka from the criticism around us, you intentionally acted cold in front of everyone. Yet you couldn’t suppress your feelings for Kagisaka, so you called him out here, right?”</p>
<p>“Well, wait, Chifuyu misunderstood—”</p>
<p>“Come on, you don’t need to be embarrassed.”</p>

<p>Pat, pat.</p>
<p>As if celebrating the success of the confession, Chifuyu patted Tomori’s shoulder, then turned towards me with a serious expression.</p>

<p>“Please, Kagisaka.”</p>

<p>Offering her right hand, she continued,</p>

<p>“Will you be friends with me?”</p>
<p>“That’s pretty sudden.”</p>
<p>“I think so too. But it’s not good for us to remain hostile even after you and Azusa got together, right? Besides, you’ve probably done various things for Azusa and me to reconcile tonight. You helped us, so thank you sincerely.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“But… I’m sorry. If you’re still bothered by the way I treated you—”</p>
<p>“No, it’s okay. I was the one who ignored Kazami from the start.”</p>
<p>“Alright, then…”</p>
<p>“I’ll gladly be your friend.”</p>
<p>“Yay! Thank you!”</p>

<p>Chifuyu happily grasped my outstretched right hand in response.</p>

<p>In the past, I might have declined.</p>
<p>However, it felt unnatural to reject now with the flow of things.</p>
<p>I might arouse suspicion about my attitude and reveal that I am Senpai. Also—</p>

<p>“It’s nice to have an otaku friend in real life!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, me too.”</p>

<p>Honestly, my heart had been aching for a while.</p>
<p>In the real world, things are strained between me and my junior, Chifuyu.</p>
<p>The only problem is…</p>

<p>“Hey, Kagisaka. About Azusa… Take care of my best friend, okay?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Even though she’s full of sarcasm on you, Azusa is a really good person! Since even someone like Azusa recognizes you, I think you must be a good person too! You really played the violin, not just using audio sources, right? I think you practiced a lot to achieve such an amazing performance.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, I think Azusa and Kagisaka are quite similar! Both of you are hardworking individuals! I’m sure you two could become an amazing couple!”</p>

<p>Hey, what are you going to do, partner?</p>
<p>Your best friend is flashing an incredibly nice smile and saying really kind words.</p>

<p>“Ah, by the way?”</p>

<p>Perhaps because she witnessed the dance and kiss.</p>
<p>Though Tomori was completely flustered, she managed to say,</p>

<p>“Um, we’re not dating, you know?”</p>
<p>“Huh? What are you saying? I didn’t catch the whole conversation, but you guys kissed just now, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“That was…!”</p>

<p>For about 5 seconds. Tomori stiffened in front of her best friend, then her small mouth moved.</p>

<p>“…isn’t that normal for a friend to do that?”</p>
<p>“…what…are you talking about?”</p>

<p>This time, it was Chifuyu who froze.</p>
<p>For a solid 10 seconds. Twice as long as Tomori, Chifuyu fell silent and then exclaimed loudly,</p>

<p>“Of course not———!?”</p>

<p>She shouted the line I’ve wanted to say for the past month and a half.</p>

<p>“What!? What’s that!? After doing all that, you’re still not dating!?”</p>
<p>“It’s not a big deal! It’s not like I like him, this bocchi-kun——”</p>
<p>“But you kissed?”</p>
<p>“W-Well, that’s…”</p>
<p>“You were dancing romantically alone in the park at night?”</p>
<p>“You were watching!?”</p>
<p>“That’s not all! I saw you guys being all lovey-dovey at that Yomisaka Land too!”</p>
<p>“!?!”</p>
<p>“As for evidence, I’ve taken plenty of photos and videos——”</p>
<p>“That’s crossing the line! Peeping is such a nasty hobby!”</p>

<p>And that was just three hours after they reconciled.</p>
<p>The stage of the night park became the arena for Tomori VS Chifuyu: Round 2 of the quarrel match.</p>
<p>However, this time it’s not a piano duet battle.</p>

<p>“I was just worried about my best friend’s love life… And besides, it’s all Azusa’s fault for doing all that and still not officially dating! You’re such a romantic klutz!”</p>
<p>“Who are you calling a klutz!? You idiot, Chifuyu!”</p>
<p>“You called me an idiot just now!? Even my parents have never said that to me!”</p>
<p>“That sounds like lines from an anime, right? You otaku girl!”</p>
<p>“Shut up! You’re watching anime and reading manga lately too! You’ve even asked me for recommendations!”</p>
<p>“W-Wait, I didn’t mean it like——”</p>
<p>” You said, ‘We should foster a bit of camaraderie as partners. Could you recommend something that Kagisaka-kun would like? ‘ “</p>
<p>“You can’t say that!”</p>
<p>“This, don’t just pinch suddenly… in that case!”</p>
<p>“Ouch!? Hey, wait, let go of your hand!”</p>
<p>“Tomorin did it first!”</p>
<p>“But I’m not as strong as Chi-chan’s pinches!”</p>

<p>Unfolding before us is the pinching battle of laughter and affection. Two girls fighting in the night park.</p>
<p>To an outsider, it must have appeared as an outrageously absurd scene.</p>
<p>But…</p>

<p>“—Pff, ahahaha!”</p>

<p>I couldn’t hold it back and burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Ah, when was the last time I laughed so much? I can’t even remember.</p>
<p>Kagisaka-kun is such an unsociable person that Tomori has set a goal to make me smile so much at the pool.</p>

<p>(But during nights like these, trying not to smile and laugh would be more difficult, right?)</p>

<p>It just seemed that heartwarming.</p>
<p>Azusa Tomori and Kazami Chifuyu. Having grown closer by opening up to each other and clashing without reservation, their figures were so endearing.</p>

<p>“Wait! Kagisakaa”</p>
<p>“Why does he look so happy laughing all by himself?”</p>

<p>They are indeed best friends.</p>
<p>After amiably letting go of each other’s cheeks simultaneously.</p>
