<h1>Chapter 4: Reunion, Past, and the Interrupted Pian</h1>
  
  
<p>The test period is over, and there’s only a little time left until summer vacation.</p>
<p>However, the students can’t relax because the long-awaited prom night is approaching.</p>
<p>‘Now that the tests are over, it’s the perfect moment to invite a dance partner!’ That’s what Jinguuji insisted on just now.</p>

<p>Well, he’ll undoubtedly dance with his girlfriend, Homura.</p>
<p>‘Since you guys are going to dance together anyway, why don’t you practice dancing together with us during lunch break?’ he said.</p>

<p>“What? Why should I be with this human insult generator?”</p>
<p>“I don’t like you either. Kagisaka-kun, why don’t you dance alone? Maybe on a heated iron plate or something.”</p>
<p>“Okay-okay. I’m tired of the quarrelsome couple act.”</p>
<p>On the unpopular music room during lunch break, Chifuyu said with an apparent sense of annoyance.</p>
<p>“Studying time is decreasing. Let’s get to the point.”</p>

<p>“Right. You wanted to talk to us about something, don’t you, Chifuyu?”</p>
<p>“Only to Azusa, not Kagisaka.”</p>
<p>“So it is. Can I go home now?”</p>
<p>“No, that won’t do. I’ve decided to rely on you more——I mean, I’ll use you more, Kagisaka-kun. Your specs are quite high, after all.”</p>

<p>‘If you’re having a hard time, you can rely on me.’ The words I told Tomori seemed to affect her a little bit.</p>

<p>(It’s good that she relies on me.)</p>

<p>However, the problem is Chifuyu’s consultation.</p>
<p>From around the day of the test, Chifuyu has clearly not been feeling well.</p>
<p>Her test scores were barely passing, and she occasionally looked lost in thought with a gloomy expression.</p>

<p>(When we talk about otaku stuff in DM, she lacks her usual sharpness.)</p>

<p>I wonder if she’s troubled by something…and that’s when Chifuyu approached Tomori with her concerns.</p>
<p>Right now, I should prioritize being a good Otaku friend over the issues on the hidden website.</p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>
<p>“What!? Calm down, Chifuyu!”</p>

<p>Tomori hurriedly speaks to her childhood friend, and it’s understandable. From Chifuyu’s blue eyes, tears are spilling out.</p>

<p>“There’s no way someone like Kagisaka can solve my problems…!”</p>
<p>“What on earth happened?”</p>
<p>“T-That…!”</p>

<p>Wiping away the tears that kept falling, Chifuyu shouted in a hoarse voice,</p>
<p>“The person I’ve had a crush on for a long time… has a girlfriend!”</p>

<p>——Wait.</p>
<p>Chifuyu’s crush is Senpai, or rather, Kimitaka Kagisaka.</p>
<p>I thought to myself that I didn’t have a girlfriend, but then I remembered the day I was invited to Tomori’s house.</p>
<p>I found a call history with ‘Kouhai-chan’ on my phone.</p>

<p>(And on that day, Tomori called Kouhai-chan ‘Otaku-friend-chan’)</p>

<p>I hadn’t told her that Kouhai-chan was a girl.</p>
<p>I wanted to soothe my restless heart, affected by the aftermath of the hug incident, so I put it off.</p>

<p>“The other day, I made a call to the person I like, and then some unknown girl answered…”</p>
<p>“That’s not a girlfriend.”</p>

<p>Chifuyu just didn’t realize that the person on the other end was Tomori.</p>
<p>I don’t know why Tomori picked up Chifuyu’s call, but she probably didn’t realize it was her childhood friend.</p>
<p>If she had recognized our relationship, she would have said something on her secret account.</p>

<p>“How could Kagisaka know that?”</p>
<p>“I’m just saying it’s premature to assume they’re a couple just because of a phone call.”</p>
<p>“Kagisaka-kun is probably right.”</p>
<p>“Are you taking this guy’s side too, Azusa!?”</p>
<p>“Kazami, I know you don’t like me. But blaming Tomori for it is getting too emotional.”</p>
<p>“…ugh.”</p>

<p>Chifuyu said with teary eyes, looking down. ‘I know, but…’</p>

<p>“Instead of speaking based on emotions, try organizing your thoughts and communicate logically.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right. That way, the misunderstandings about your crush might clear up.”</p>
<p>“Bu-but…”</p>
<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>In response to my inquiry, Chifuyu, with her sapphire-coloured eyes glistening, choked on her words.</p>

<p>“I-I heard her say that…”</p>
<p>“What? What did she say?”</p>
<p>“That’s! She said something about having sex!”</p>
<p>(TN: Chifuyu is assuming things because Tomori said, [And, you know… he’s even seen my underwear before!]. )</p>

<p>Hey, wait, everyone’s friend-san. What did you say to my Kouhai-chan?</p>

<p>“Uwaaaaaaa, I can’t take it anymore! He had a girlfriend!”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t cry. Maybe it’s not a girlfriend… “</p>
<p>“Not a girlfriend?”</p>
<p>“…They might just have a physical relationship.”</p>
<p>“You mean like friends with benefits!? Don’t make fun of the person I like! He wouldn’t have such a cheap relationship!”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case… I hate to say it, but maybe she’s his girlfriend?”</p>
<p>“!? “</p>
<p>“It’s unfortunate, but the two of them are dating——”</p>
<p>“Uwaaaaah, Azusaaaaaa, you idiot!”</p>
<p>“Calm down! It’s okay! I’m here with you!”</p>
<p>“Uuu…”</p>
<p>“For now, you can cry as much as you want. Trust me. I won’t tell anyone about this, and I won’t laugh at you for crying.”</p>
<p>“Sniff, Hiks, A-Azusa.”</p>

<p>Tomori embraces the crying Chifuyu, comforting her with a gentle hug.</p>
<p>It’s a beautiful friendship scene that could belong in a Yuri anime.</p>
<p>The problem is that they are completely unaware of the fact that they are each other’s rivals in love.</p>

<p>(This is my chance.)</p>

<p>Encouraged by Tomori’s question, I’ll try to deduce why Chifuyu misunderstood.</p>

<p>“——”</p>

<p>Could it be that Tomori said something in the call that led to the misunderstanding?</p>

<p>(Considering Chifuyu’s stubborn personality, I can guess the flow of events.)</p>

<p>It seems that when Tomori answered the call, Chifuyu must have tried to throw her off balance in some way, giving the impression that she and Senpai were close.</p>
<p>As a result…</p>

<p>(It’s speculation, but could Tomori have countered as well?)</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, Tomori would never do something like that and would try to handle the situation calmly.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to her own love life, she tends to lose her composure.</p>
<p>Perhaps neither of them realized they were talking to their best friend and panicked, assuming the other person was their love rival.</p>
<p>Counterattack?</p>

<p>(And as a countermeasure, Tomori said something to hint at her relationship with me… maybe?)</p>

<p>Based on Chifuyu’s earlier statement, I can deduce that she didn’t say anything directly.</p>
<p>It was more like ‘something about.’</p>
<p>So, it’s not entirely fabricated, but it doesn’t seem like a 100% truthful story, either.</p>

<p>(Although she might be a bit clumsy in love matters, Tomori is quite sharp and a high-achieving honor student.)</p>

<p>She should understand that easily fabricated lies are easy to expose.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, the likelihood is high that she created the story based on something that happened in reality.</p>
<p>Doing so would make the lie more convincing.</p>

<p>The answer that comes to mind right now is——</p>
<p>① I have been seen in my underwear by him before.</p>
<p>② I have been on a cafe date with him before.</p>
<p>③ I invited him to my home.</p>
<p>④ I often study together with him.</p>
<p>While I cannot confirm which option is the correct one, options ① or ③ seem to be the most likely ones.</p>

<p>If Chifuyu is confronted, she could defend herself by saying, ‘I didn’t lie,’ and it would be a perfect counter-punch to throw at her love rival, boasting about her relationship with Senpai.</p>
<p>As a result, Chifuyu came to wholeheartedly believe that Senpai has a girlfriend.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>In that case——</p>

<p>“Why don’t you just ask your crush directly? Say, ‘Do you have a girlfriend?’ “</p>

<p>This would be the best approach.</p>
<p>First, let Chifuyu ask the question.</p>
<p>Afterward, I can clarify the misunderstanding as Senpai.</p>

<p>“Are you an idiot?” </p>

<p>Chifuyu scolded with a line from a very old anime. (Evangelion.)</p>

<p>“I could never ask that kind of question!”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Loner-kun is an idiot. If I were told something like ‘I have a girlfriend’ from my crush, it’s obvious I wouldn’t be able to recover from it!”</p>
<p>“You really get me, Azusa!”</p>
<p>“Well, we’ve been childhood friends! It’s only natural!”</p>

<p>The love rivals found common ground.</p>
<p>I wonder, it feels like watching a hub and a mongoose shake hands without knowing each other’s true identity…</p>

<p>(Well, can’t be helped.)</p>

<p>Instead of acting as Kimitaka Kagisaka, I’ll act as Senpai.</p>
<p>I want to avoid ruining my relationship with Kouhai-chan, but I don’t want to see my close friend thinking she’s been rejected and feeling down like this.</p>

<p>(To do so, I can’t use my usual approach for this.)</p>

<p>Judging by how shaken Chifuyu is, I don’t think she would believe me even if I talked to her through DM or a call.</p>
<p>In that case, I’ll have to be prepared for some risk.</p>

<p>“Huh!?”</p>

<p>I sent a DM to Chifuyu, pretending to check the time on my phone; then Chifuyu stood up as her red checkered skirt swayed.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“J-just now! I received a DM from my crush…!”</p>

<p>Despite being extremely surprised, Chifuyu showed us the screen of her phone. The message written there was:</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>“…Good evening, Senpai.”</p>

<p>It was 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Under the cool night sky, uncommon for July, Chifuyu, in her school uniform, approached me in a small park in Shin-Himegaoka.</p>

<p>“Hey, Chifuyu.”</p>

<p>I greeted her in a slightly deeper voice than usual.</p>

<p>“Sorry for calling you out so suddenly.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine… Can… Can I sit next to you?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Thank you…”</p>

<p>She sat on the bench where I was already seated, looking extremely nervous.</p>

<p>(I hope she won’t figure it out.)</p>

<p>Currently, I’m wearing a red wig on my head.</p>
<p>As Kei, the leader of the delinquent team Kazarina, I had prepared for the possibility of meeting Chifuyu as Kei.</p>
<p>Though I didn’t dye my hair as I did in my delinquent days, this wig is of good quality, and it’s unlikely she’ll notice.</p>
<p>Additionally, I wore a black mask to hide my facial expressions.</p>

<p>“What’s with the mask? Are you sick?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, it’s not. I’ve had my face exposed to all sorts of people. It’s just a minor disguise.”</p>

<p>I wasn’t lying. Back when I was the leader of Kazarina, there were times when martial arts enthusiasts would challenge me, thinking I was strong due to my reputation.</p>

<p>“True, Senpai is quite famous.”</p>
<p>“Well, Hiroto-san is in charge of Kazarina now.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Hiroto-san. I’ve never met him before, but I’ve heard various stories.”</p>
<p>“Various stories?”</p>
<p>“He’s famous! One of the five founding members of Kazarina! There are all kinds of rumors about him on the internet! The legendary Kei’s right-hand man! He helps teenagers with their problems, negotiates with rival teams’ leaders during conflicts, and he’s said to be frighteningly sharp-minded!”</p>
<p>“Most of it is true.”</p>

<p>Kazarina was born when my former partner and I first met.</p>
<p>But without Hiroto-san, the team wouldn’t have grown to such a large size.</p>
<p>‘I think Hiroto-san is Kazarina’s brains!’ My former partner used to say that during our delinquent days.</p>

<p>He is indeed a reliable schemer, and he played a significant role in helping Tomori in May.</p>

<p>“I’d like to meet him someday.”</p>
<p>“It’s better not to. He’s extremely intimidating.”</p>
<p>“Is he that scary?”</p>
<p>“He’s probably the most ruthless person in Kazarina… Well, let’s talk about that another time.”</p>

<p>I feel like Chifuyu was trying to steer the conversation toward talking about Hiroto-san.</p>
<p>She probably deliberately didn’t want to get to the main point yet.</p>

<p>“…Well, there’s something important I want to talk about.”</p>

<p>Chifuyu said with tears welling up in her intensely blue eyes, but she bravely put on a smile.</p>

<p>“Congratulations.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Senpai, you have a girlfriend, right? I came tonight to hear the news.”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry. I picked a fight with Senpai’s girlfriend the other day and made her angry. She said some things back, but I believe she must be a good person since Senpai chose her. So, that’s why I wanted to celebrate too…”</p>
<p>“Chifuyu…”</p>

<p>Gently patting the slender shoulder of her otaku friend, who was holding back sobs, I said, ‘She’s not my girlfriend.’</p>

<p>“Huh!?”</p>
<p>“She’s just a friend.”</p>
<p>“But, but! You were studying at her house, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“And she makes lunch for you three times a week?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah.”</p>
<p>“And she even claimed that you’ve seen her underwear before!?”</p>
<p>“It was just a strong wind that lifted her skirt.”</p>

<p>Though my speculation about the bluff was accurate, I offered an explanation, but it’s still painful.</p>
<p>It felt like I was telling her some stupid excuses when all I was doing was telling the truth…</p>

<p>“Really!?”</p>

<p>Finally, Chifuyu, with tears welling up, let out a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Alright. I believe you. I’ve known Senpai for a long time, though we haven’t met in person. We’ve been exchanging DMs frequently. I know you’re not the kind of person to lie in a situation like this.”</p>
<p>“Chifuyu…”</p>
<p>“And besides, for someone as clever as Senpai, the excuses you came up with were just too silly if they were made up.”</p>

<p>Chifuyu said reassuringly, wiping away her tears.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“I’m glad I told you the truth…”</p>
<p>“I’m so glad I came to see you! It’s amazing how easily the misunderstanding was resolved!”</p>

<p>Under the shining silver hair beneath the streetlamp, Chifuyu wiped away her tears and smiled.</p>

<p>——Yeah, Chifuyu is such a great person.</p>
<p>Normally, she could have doubted me more, but I was confident that everything would be fine once we met face-to-face.</p>
<p>We are best friends, after all.</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to lose to that girl.”</p>
<p>“Huh…”</p>
<p>“As an observant Senpai, you’ve probably noticed, right? That girl definitely likes you!”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah.”</p>
<p>“I knew it! Has she confessed to you yet?”</p>
<p>“No, she hasn’t.”</p>
<p>“What kind of person is she? How old is she? Is she a member of Kazarina? Is she a student at the same school as you? Is she cuter than me? Show me a picture if you have one!”</p>
<p>“Calm down, Kouhai-chan.”</p>
<p>“Aww, I’m so curious! If Senpai ends up liking her…”</p>

<p>Chifuyu was overflowing with excitement and curiosity, bombarding me with questions.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. Like I said before, I have no intention of getting into a romantic relationship while in high school.”</p>
<p>“Really!?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I wanted to ask… Between me and that girl, who do you like better?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Me, right!? Then say you ‘like’ me! Right here, right now!”</p>
<p>“Do you think I can say something so embarrassing like that?”</p>

<p>Just like Tomori, it seems that Chifuyu also loses control when it comes to romance.</p>
<p>Asking me to say ‘I like you’ right here is just funny.</p>

<p>“Huh? Why are you laughing?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s nothing. I just thought that the Chifuyu I first met would never say such things.”</p>
<p>“Well… I guess I was very different back then.”</p>
<p>“By the way, we first met at this park, right?”</p>

<p>Back then, I was in 9th grade.</p>
<p>I was pretending to be a high schooler and leading Kazarina.</p>

<p>『P-please stop!』</p>

<p>As I was walking alone on the sidewalk in front of the park after 2 in the morning, I heard a scream.</p>
<p>There was a silver-haired girl in the park, all alone, despite the late hour.</p>
<p>Next to her was a silver-colored carry-on bag.</p>
<p>Drawing from my experience as Kei, I immediately knew what was going on.</p>
<p>She had run away from home.</p>

<p>“Thank you for that time. You helped me when those guys were bothering me.”</p>
<p>“They were trying to extort money from you, huh? Well, back then, you looked like an easy target.”</p>

<p>She was a sheltered young lady. If I had to describe her in a few words, that would be it.</p>
<p>Long hair in braids, glasses on her face, and her clothing and shoes were clearly branded.</p>
<p>She had a quiet and innocent appearance.</p>

<p>(Maybe it wasn’t just about extorting money.)</p>

<p>The three university-aged guys who had approached Chifuyu probably thought they could drag her away if they pushed her hard enough.</p>

<p>“Ah, right, I remember. When Senpai started approaching me, those guys ran away in fear, shouting, ‘It’s Kei!?’ “</p>
<p>“Well, red hair does stand out.”</p>

<p>After that, Chifuyu and I talked.</p>
<p>For Kei, it was natural to talk to people of the same age, and Chifuyu must have felt lonely.</p>
<p>After I helped her, she seemed to trust me and opened up about various things.</p>

<p>Chifuyu was born into a musical family and had been learning piano since she was young.</p>
<p>Afterward, due to certain circumstances, she told her parents, ‘I want to quit playing the piano,’ but they strongly opposed it.</p>
<p>As a result, she ended up running away from home.</p>

<p>“At that time, I was really grateful that you listened to me.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a big deal.”</p>
<p>“No, it was! Senpai, you listened to my various worries. I talked about my concerns about not being able to achieve good results in the piano competition.”</p>

<p>I still remember Chifuyu’s words from back then.</p>

<p>『I have a friend who is like a hero to me.』</p>

<p>At that time, I had no idea who that hero was, but the hero’s name was Azusa Tomori.</p>
<p>According to Chifuyu, Tomori was also popular during our middle school days.</p>

<p>“Azusa has always been amazing.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“She was the one who solved the problems and issues of the students all by herself! She excelled in both academics and sports, always at the top!”</p>
<p>“But… Chifuyu, you were quite skilled at playing the piano, right?”</p>
<p>“But… That was the only thing I was good at. At that time, I was a shy introvert, and I had no friends except for Azusa.”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“For me, Azusa was someone very special. That’s why when I saw Azusa, I felt really insecure…”</p>

<p>Anxiety crossed her mind, and Chifuyu’s expression clouded.</p>
<p>Will she still be able to remain friends with Azusa Tomori like this?</p>

<p>She’s worried that if she doesn’t become someone special herself, she might be left behind by her best friend.</p>
<p>Because of those thoughts, Kazami Chifuyu devoted herself even more to playing the piano and tried to achieve good results in the competition.</p>

<p>However, the reality was harsh.</p>
<p>She couldn’t achieve the same results as before and couldn’t even place in the competitions.</p>
<p>It was a picture-perfect slump.</p>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed and cornered by the wall, she struggled and worried, which led to that decision.</p>

<p>“I fought with my parents, saying, ‘I want to quit the piano! I don’t want to stay in this house anymore!’ and ran away from home.”</p>
<p>“That’s a story from over two years ago now.”</p>
<p>“Ah, it feels nostalgic. Running away like that was a childish act on my part, but thanks to that, I met you, Senpai!”</p>

<p>Her beautiful appearance, rivaling the moon in the night sky, was adorned with a smile.</p>

<p>“Do you remember? You gave me advice back then.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I remember.”</p>
<p>“You said, ‘Do you really have to decide to quit the piano right away? Life isn’t just black and white. There are shades of gray, and sometimes it’s better to make decisions in between.’ “</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, it sounds like preachy advice.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not! That advice saved me. I went back home and asked my parents, ‘Instead of quitting the piano, could you let me take a little break?'”</p>
<p>“It worked out well, didn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! My parents even said, ‘Taking a break might be a good idea. With time, your perspective on the piano may change.’ “</p>
<p>“It’s great that you have understanding parents.”</p>
<p>“Thanks to Senpai, I was able to persuade my parents! To listen so sincerely to the story of a complete stranger and give advice…!”</p>
<p>“That was my role back then.”</p>

<p>Also, I couldn’t just leave Chifuyu, who was struggling with similar worries as me.</p>
<p>When I became a delinquent and got tired of the Kagisaka main family, I could deeply understand Chifuyu’s feelings when she ran away from home.</p>

<p>(It felt like I could empathize with her as if it were my own situation.)</p>

<p> </p>


<p>I strongly wished to save her if possible.</p>
<p>I bet on the possibility of her having understanding parents, unlike myself.</p>

<p>“Did you resume playing the piano?”</p>
<p>“No. I’m going to play at an event at the academy, but I still don’t have the intention to enter competitions. I haven’t overcome the slump yet.”</p>
<p>“I see. Well, take your time to figure things out.”</p>
<p>“Mhm. Are you just saying that as a casual remark, acting like it’s none of your business?”</p>
<p>“Why would you think that? You’re not just anyone, Chifuyu. You’re an important friend. Well, I’m sure you have other friends besides me.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s true. I came here today because of Senpai’s DM and Azusa encouraging me from behind. And also…”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Remember we talked before? I said there’s someone Azusa’s interested in, right?”</p>
<p>“You mean Kagisaka.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that infuriating guy. But… maybe this time, I should thank him a bit. He also suggested that it would be good for me to talk with Senpai.”</p>

<p>After saying that, Chifuyu stood up from the bench.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to leave you, but I’ll have to say goodbye soon. If I stay out too late, my parents will worry.”</p>
<p>“I’ll walk you home then.”</p>
<p>“Wow, thanks! You’re really different from Kagisaka, Senpai. He’s nowhere near as thoughtful… and you’re cool.”</p>
<p>“Most of our DMs are about otaku stuff, though.”</p>
<p>“I don’t mind you being an otaku at all! Thanks to meeting you, I was able to change. I used to be so shy, but I tried different hairstyles and outfits, and I worked hard to improve my social skills!”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“I wanted to have common topics to talk about with you, and before I knew it, I became an otaku who loves anime and games. Since that night when we met in this park, I’ve… I’ve been in love with you, Senpai.”</p>
<p>“Chifuyu…”</p>
<p>“So, I won’t let anyone take you away from me.”</p>

<p>For just a moment, Chifuyu blushed, and then she lifted the hem of her red checkered skirt with both hands.</p>

<p>I was genuinely surprised.</p>
<p>The school uniform’s short skirt.</p>
<p>In that brief moment, I caught a glimpse of delicately embroidered pure white underwear.</p>

<p>“Ha… hahaha.”</p>

<p>With her face burning red up to her ears, Chifuyu looked triumphant.</p>

<p>“How’s that? Now that girl has one less advantage.”</p>
<p>“…You know, don’t just do things like this so easily. Earlier, you couldn’t even say that she showed her underwear.”</p>

<p>Trying to hide my embarrassment, I retorted.</p>
<p>But then Chifuyu tightly grasped the hem of her skirt and muttered.</p>

<p>“…I wasn’t embarrassed, okay…?”</p>

<div><img src="https://animestuff.me/Senki/0012_T29.png" alt="" />

<p>” …… “‘</p>
<p>“I’m doing something like this… only in front of Senpai. Maybe… I can even do…evenmore lewd things…?”</p>

<p>She gazed up at me with watery azure eyes, her expression bashful.</p>

<p>“——Chifuyu.”</p>
<p>“!? W-What? Why the serious look all of a sudden… Wait, don’t tell me you’re about to—”</p>
<p>“Your approach is too straightforward.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I think you’re watching too much romantic comedies anime. In fiction, making bold moves like this can leave a strong impression on the audience. But in real life, it can have the opposite effect and make the other person uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>“Ah!? I couldn’t help it! Because… because I was so happy to see you after such a long time…”</p>

<p>Chifuyu said in a meek voice, completely different from the straightforward challenge she had just thrown at me.</p>

<p>” …… “</p>

<p>Could it be… is she doing this on purpose?</p>
<p>That straightforward confession earlier, even though I pretended it made me calm, truthfully made my heart race.</p>
<p>And now, with this cute curveball approach from Chifuyu, I couldn’t help but want to pat her head.</p>
<p>Anyway——</p>

<p>“Let’s go now.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Oh, right! Let’s talk about otaku stuff until we get home!”</p>
<p>“We always do that through DM, don’t we?”</p>
<p>“Talking face-to-face is totally different! It’s so much fun and makes me happy!”</p>

<p>I deeply resonated with Chifuyu’s words.</p>
<p>Otaku friends we could only meet online.</p>
<p>After two years, I finally got to see my Kouhai-chan again.</p>

<p>“—I guess I’m feeling just as happy as you.”</p>

<p>I muttered in a soft voice, barely audible to Chifuyu walking beside me.</p>
<p>Just like on the night we first met, I decided to accompany my dear friend.</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>Anyway, with this, the matter seems to be settled.</p>
<p>I managed to help Chifuyu with her worries, and for the time being, everything worked out.</p>
<p>Or so I thought until the next day’s lunch break.</p>

<p>“Here, these are for you. My dad got these from his workplace the other day.”</p>

<p>Once again, in the empty music room, Chifuyu handed two tickets to Tomori and me.</p>
<p>The tickets had the name of an amusement park and pool facility near Shinhime Station.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Azusa! I’d like to thank Kagisaka as well. Thanks to you both, I got to meet my crush after so long, and the misunderstandings have been cleared!”</p>

<p>Chifuyu, with a smile full of happiness, announces.</p>

<p>“This is my thank-you to both of you. Since the tests are over, why don’t you two go on a date this Sunday?”</p>
