<h2>Chapter 8: Dance on the Keyboard</h2>


<p>I wonder why I said such things.</p>

<p>It’s Prom day.</p>
<p>The gymnasium of Aisu Academy was decorated extravagantly, much like a party venue in a high-end hotel. I, dressed in a white party dress, was waiting backstage.</p>

<p>“Good evening, second-year students. Tonight is the long-awaited prom.”</p>

<p>The person currently giving a speech on the stage is Seira Hirowatari.</p>
<p>The second-year students, dressed in dresses and tuxedos, were filled with excitement at the Student Council President’s opening address.</p>
<p>It was a glamorous party atmosphere.</p>

<p>However, I just couldn’t get into the mood to fully enjoy the event.</p>
<p>My heart was filled with regret.</p>
<p>Back at Yomisaka Land, I said to Azusa that she looked down on me…</p>

<p>(That can’t be true.)</p>

<p>I was truly the worst on that day.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve cooled down, I can understand.</p>
<p>I saw Kagisaka, who was being affectionate with Azusa by the pool, like they were a couple in love. I felt jealous of him.</p>
<p>That’s why I ended up saying hurtful words to my best friend…</p>
<p>Of course, the next day at the academy, I tried to apologize to Azusa, but…</p>

<p>“…ugh.”</p>

<p>—What if Azusa doesn’t forgive me?</p>

<p>We might never be able to go back to being friends.</p>
<p>Just thinking about that made me hesitate, I was scared, and I couldn’t even bring myself to talk to her…</p>

<p>“Well then, it’s time for the party to begin. But before that, let’s have a splendid performance.”</p>

<p>I shivered at the Student Council President’s words.</p>
<p>After this, I have to play the piano. I absolutely cannot fail.</p>

<p>Azusa Tomori and Kazami Chifuyu had a fight.</p>
<p>Rumors like that seem to have spread throughout the academy.</p>
<p>If I make a mistake in my performance here, everyone might think it’s because of the fight with Azusa that I messed up my composure.</p>

<p>(I don’t mind being blamed for mistakes or laughed at myself…)</p>

<p>It’s fine if I get teased or bullied like I was when I was a kid, because it’s all my fault.</p>
<p>But Azusa will surely be bothered.</p>

<p>(…That’s something I can’t bear.)</p>

<p>I’ve already hurt her with hurtful words and haven’t even been able to apologize, so I can’t cause her more trouble!</p>
<p>That’s why I absolutely cannot fail tonight!</p>

<p>Senpai encouraged me earlier too…</p>

<p>“Huh—”</p>

<p>However, as I was about to walk towards the grand piano on the stage for the performance, I was taken aback. So were the students in the hall.</p>
<p>Emerging onto the stage from the opposite backstage from where I was, Kimitaka Kagisaka appeared in a tuxedo.</p>
<p>In his right hand, he held a violin.</p>

<p>“Originally, the performance was supposed to be just a piano, but he agreed to perform at the last minute.”</p>

<p>Explained the Student Council President with a microphone in hand, but the audience was clearly in a stir.</p>

<p>“Why Kagisaka?”</p>
<p>“Our school director was known to be a music enthusiast…”</p>
<p>“Who ever heard that he could play the violin?”</p>
<p>“Could he have used his family influence again?”</p>
<p>“Maybe he just wants to impress Tomori.”</p>

<p>With Kagisaka becoming Azusa’s partner, there are many students who have developed animosity towards him.</p>
<p>I also heard rumors that some of these students have been posting negative comments about him on an anonymous bulletin board.</p>

<p>(I haven’t done anything like that though.)</p>

<p>It’s true that I felt jealous of Kagisaka just like everyone else, however——</p>

<p>“!?”</p>

<p>The murmurs in the noisy venue came to a halt.</p>
<p>As soon as Kagisaka began playing the violin, the atmosphere changed as if under a spell.</p>

<p>(What is this?)</p>

<p>Echoing through the prom night is nothing but a beautiful melody.</p>
<p>The piece is Bach’s ‘Air on the G String.’</p>

<p>It’s a widely known masterpiece, but…</p>

<p>“…It’s beautiful.”</p>

<p>The performance is so fluent that anyone can’t help but marvel at it.</p>
<p>Kimitaka Kagisaka, playing the violin in a tuxedo.</p>
<p>Unlike his usual listless demeanor, he was simply shone on the stage.</p>
<p>He even rivaled the Student Council President, who had enchanted the students by wearing a black dress. It’s a top-tier performance.</p>

<p>You could tell from the audience’s reactions.</p>
<p>Even the students who were negative about Kagisaka just moments ago were now captivated by the melody he was playing.</p>
<p>Kagisaka’s performance was truly amazing.</p>

<p>(…Incredible!)</p>

<p>Though the instruments may differ, I’ve been playing the piano since I was a child. So, I understand.</p>
<p>This performance isn’t just about talent.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be achieved solely through imagination. It requires an unimaginable amount of practice.</p>
<p>Like cutting and polishing a rough diamond into a beautiful gemstone — quite literally, this is the culmination of effort.</p>

<p>“———”</p>

<p>As soon as the performance ended, a wave of applause and cheers erupted.</p>
<p>Kagisaka’s violin was so tremendous that everyone forgot that standing on stage was a troublemaker boy who had been the subject of so much antagonism.</p>

<p>“It was an outstanding performance.”</p>

<p>The Student Council President, standing beside Kagisaka, praised through the microphone.</p>

<p>“Truly wonderful——huh?”</p>

<p>Suddenly, as if interrupting my words, Kagisaka whispered something to the Student Council President.</p>
<p>For a moment, the Student Council President appeared surprised, then she said, ‘I understand,’ and handed the microphone to Kagisaka with a smile.</p>
<p>And then…</p>

<p>“Thank you for listening to my performance.”</p>

<p>The words of the troublemaker caused a buzz of astonishment throughout the venue…Is he joking?</p>

<p>That unsociable Kagisaka, who didn’t form connections with anyone except Azusa, thanked everyone?</p>

<p>“I stood here tonight, hoping to contribute even a little to livening up the prom and bringing joy to everyone’s hearts.”</p>

<p>In a very earnest tone, Kagisaka continued.</p>

<p>“At first, I had no intention of performing.</p>
<p>I am—exactly the person everyone here thinks I am. Introverted, lacking social skills, refuse to make connections with anyone, and keep a cold attitude towards those around me.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, I’m a mess.</p>
<p>As long as I could study, as long as I could get into a good university for my future, that was enough. Other people didn’t matter to me. I only thought about selfish things like that.</p>
<p>I don’t need friends, and High school life is boring.</p>
<p>All my life, that’s what I thought…”</p>

<p>Speaking in a smooth, practiced tone as if rehearsed multiple times, Kagisaka’s words captivated the over 100 students in the venue, perhaps still under the effect of his previous performance.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“But, I was able to change a little—well, there’s someone who changed me like this. It’s Azusa Tomori.</p>
<p>She became friends with a difficult, unsociable troublemaker like me.</p>
<p>And through being with Tomori, I realized…</p>
<p>Spending high school life with friends of the same age can be this enjoyable.</p>
<p>—That’s why. There’s something I really want to tell Tomori.”</p>

<p>On the stage.</p>
<p>With a confident stance, Kagisaka simply earnestly projected his voice through the microphone.</p>

<p>“I like Azusa Tomori.”</p>

<p>A confession.</p>
<p>At the words spoken by the troublemaker of the academy, the audience collectively gasped their breath.</p>

<p>“I want to be in a relationship with you.</p>
<p>You don’t have to answer now, even after the prom is fine.</p>
<p>I’ll wait as long as it takes. You can take your time, beause Tomori, who changed me like this, is someone I love.”</p>

<p>And with that, Kagisaka’s speech ended.</p>
<p>He returned the microphone to the chairman and as he left the stage, the current of excitement exploded throughout the venue.</p>

<p>“Is this for real!?”</p>
<p>“He confessed on the prom stage!”</p>
<p>“What’s up with Kagisaka, he’s trying to act all cool!”</p>
<p>“But, the confession just now… wasn’t that pretty good?”</p>
<p>“Um, yeah! It was really heartfelt… and the performance before that was amazing too!”</p>
<p>“Is that really the Kagisaka we know?”</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen Kagisaka so serious…”</p>
<p>“Playing the violin to entertain us…!”</p>
<p>“Just like the confession earlier, Azusa-chan really changed Kagisaka!”</p>
<p>“Could it be that those two will start dating?”</p>
<p>“Then maybe they’ll dance together tonight…?!”</p>

<p>The voices of the students buzzed around.</p>
<p>From the offstage, I couldn’t see the whole picture of the venue.</p>
<p>I couldn’t confirm how Azusa, who should be downstage, looked, but…</p>

<p>(…It’s obvious they’ll be together)</p>

<p>I’m the only one who knows.</p>
<p>Azusa had been interested in Kagisaka for a while.</p>
<p>So, she should accept the confession.</p>
<p>If that happens…</p>

<p>“….ugh.”</p>

<p>I think she won’t care about me anymore, won’t she?</p>
<p>In the face of this idea that seemed like a sudden descent of a devil, I couldn’t stop trembling.</p>
<p>The boy she has always liked for so long is going to be her boyfriend.</p>
<p>She might lose interest in reconciling with me.</p>
<p>In fact, Azusa might even distance herself from me because she thinks I dislike Kagisaka. If that happens…</p>
<p>No matter how much I apologize, reconciliation might become impossible…!</p>

<p>“Fufu. It was an unexpected surprise, huh? Well then, it’s time for the piano next.”</p>

<p>The chairman’s words on the stage sent a shiver down my spine.</p>
<p>The performance and confession were so shocking that I had completely forgotten I was supposed to play the piano.</p>
<p>The audience must be feeling the same way too.</p>

<p>My head is full of Kagisaka.</p>
<p>Already, my mind is a mess, and to succeed in performing under this kind of atmosphere, it’s impossible, even if it’s a god…!</p>

<p>“Chifuyu.”</p>

<p>I was suddenly called from behind.</p>
<p>When I turned around, I saw Azusa Tomori in a red dress offstage.</p>

<p>“.. Azusa? Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“I was worried that Chifuyu was nervous. If you want, should we play the piano together?”</p>
<p>“Huh!?”</p>
<p>“We used to play duets together often, right? If you’re so nervous that you can’t play alone, why don’t we do that? I’m sure it will be fun!”</p>

<p>Her smile was like the unclouded sun.</p>
<p>In that moment of seeing Azusa, dressed flawlessly in her crimson dress, offering to help me, I realized.</p>

<p>(Ah)</p>

<p>Tonight is the last night.</p>
<p>Azusa should remember my words at the pool.</p>
<p>—Always helping me, yet never relying on me even a little! I hurled ugly emotions at her, so unpleasant to remember.</p>
<p>And yet, she’s trying to help me tonight—probably because it’s the last chance.</p>
<p>As a settlement of our friendship, Azusa Tomori intends to help Kazami Chifuyu.</p>
<p>Agreeing with her confession earlier, she decided to walk with Kagisaka…</p>

<p>“——Alright.”</p>

<p>I nodded, squeezing out what little pride I had left.</p>
<p>Tears were about to spill, but I struggled to hold back.</p>

<p>(Don’t cry! It’s all your fault! I’m the bad one…)</p>

<p>Frantically telling myself this in my mind, I felt miserable beyond belief.</p>
<p>My best friend is going to date the guy I despise.</p>
<p>And worse, I’m seeking help from the friend I once rejected.</p>

<p>There’s no going back to being friends now.</p>
<p>I feel so awful that I want to die. But—maybe it’s fitting for me now.</p>
<p>Punishment for hurting Azusa, who has always helped me.</p>

<p>(After tonight’s performance…)</p>

<p>I’ll stop getting close to Azusa forever.</p>
<p>With determination deep in my heart, I walked onto the stage with my friend.</p>

<p>******</p>

<p>“Has it begun?”</p>

<p>Whispering quietly as I returned from the stage to under the stage, I watched as Chifuyu and Tomori appeared on the stage together once more, causing the venue to buzz with excitement again. Amidst that, the performance started!!</p>

<p>A duet.</p>
<p>A collaboration by Kazami Chifuyu and Azusa Tomori.</p>
<p>Their fingertips danced on the black and white keys.</p>

<p>——Even though they were supposed to be fighting, can they really play a duet?</p>

<p>Probably everyone in the audience had thought so.</p>
<p>However, their doubts were blown away in an instant.</p>
<p>Perhaps because they didn’t notice, I had returned offstage after finishing my confession earlier.</p>

<p>The performance by the two of them was tremendous.</p>
<p>I don’t know the piece they played. Perhaps it was an original composition they created together in the past.</p>
<p>Still, what’s clear is the extraordinary skill of the performers on the stage.</p>
<p>It’s a melody so harmonious it’s captivating to listen to.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Amazing.”</p>
<p>“Hey-hey, is Kazami that skilled at the piano…?”</p>
<p>“Idiot! Are you a new student? Don’t you know Kazami’s old nickname?”</p>
<p>“The ‘Piano Prodigy.’ She comes from a musical family, and until she was in 8th grade, it wasn’t rare for her to be ranked first in the whole country.”</p>
<p>“But I’m impressed that Azusa-chan can keep up with her.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, didn’t Tomori take piano lessons from Kazami in the past?”</p>
<p>“Even if they say they’re fighting, they’re childhood friends after all. Their harmony is perfect.”</p>
<p>“It’s like they’re playing together while helping each other…”</p>

<p>Some students whispered in subdued admiration.</p>

<p>(Playing together while helping each other… huh?)</p>

<p>You don’t understand any of this. That’s not playing together while helping each other.</p>
<p>It’s just two childhood friends having their first fight.</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>What does she think she’s doing———!?</p>

<p>Desperately struggling to keep up with Azusa’s performance next to me, I was screaming inside my head.</p>
<p>From the moment it began, Azusa’s performance was chaotic. Adding arbitrary arrangements, selfishly attempting solos, not playing the piece we created as it was, but rather freely wreaking havoc on the keyboard.</p>
<p>To everyone else, it might sound like a perfectly synchronized duet, but that’s because I’m desperately covering for her.</p>

<p>(This, this person…!)</p>

<p>There’s absolutely no intention of helping me!</p>

<p>‘To settle the friendship, Azusa Tomori intends to help Kazami Chifuyu’? Completely off the mark!</p>
<p>Otherwise, she wouldn’t play a performance like she’s showing off her skills for hire!</p>

<p>“!?”</p>

<p>Azusa’s performance deviated greatly from the course I anticipated.</p>
<p>To prevent the audience from realizing this fact, I immediately followed and recovered. Thus, we continue to play in unison.</p>

<p>(Ah, seriously!)</p>

<p>‘What’s her purpose!?’ While cursing in my mind——.</p>
<p>Perhaps inspired by the melody of my childhood friend, I remembered something.</p>

<p>(Come to think of it, Azusa used to be like this)</p>

<p>She often stuck her nose into unrelated fights, saying [There’s a kid being bullied!] She even dragged my shy self around the town for explorations.</p>
<p>Even in the duets we used to play when we were younger, Azusa wanted to play as she pleased, and I always had to bring our performances together.</p>
<p>Honestly, it was quite challenging to keep up with her whims…</p>

<p>(——Being with Azusa was really enjoyable.)</p>

<p>I was genuinely surprised by my own thoughts.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>

<p>—Am I actually enjoying playing the piano again?</p>

<p>No matter how much effort I put into competitions, I couldn’t achieve good results, and I even grew to hate the piano to the point of running away…</p>
<p>I stopped playing the piano around the time I was in 9th grade.</p>
<p>At that time, Azusa had become the hero of the school.</p>
<p>With piano being my only skill, I was anxious about being left behind by my best friend.</p>
<p>So, I tried even harder to achieve better results in competitions.</p>
<p>But the more I tried to play flawlessly and accurately, the less chance I had of winning.</p>

<p>(——Ah, I see.)</p>

<p>Following Senpai’s advice, it’s clear now after these two years of hardly playing the piano.</p>
<p>It’s boring to play with a focus on accuracy and a fear of making mistakes. That’s just pandering to the judges.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s true that I used to achieve results in competitions…</p>

<p>(Because I genuinely enjoyed playing the piano.)</p>

<p>And it was Azusa who gave me that feeling.</p>
<p>I come from a musical family, but initially, I disliked playing the piano.</p>
<p>Even as a child, I detested being told to play by someone.</p>

<p>『Hey, Chi-chan! Can you teach me the piano?』 But young Azusa changed me.</p>
<p>She begged me to teach her the piano, and when I played a piece, she smiled and rejoiced.</p>
<p>Of course, duet playing like today was also enjoyable—</p>

<p>“It’s fun, Chifuyu.”</p>

<p>I was taken aback by the soft voice that sounded just inches away. Is this real?</p>
<p>Can people really talk during a duet?</p>
<p>How much of a perfect superhuman are you?</p>

<p>This girl wasn’t only good at sports and studies; she also had a talent for music…</p>

<p>(Can’t I even keep up with Azusa in playing the piano?)</p>

<p>Despair creeps in.</p>
<p>Azusa Tomori is an extraordinary and capable individual.</p>
<p>So, maybe it’s okay that I can’t win against her on piano…</p>

<p>『Are you okay, Chifuyu?』</p>

<p>In an instant, Senpai’s voice resurfaced in my mind.</p>
<p>Just before the prom started, I received a call from Senpai.</p>

<p>『In DM, I thought you seemed down lately…』</p>

<p>He quickly saw through my condition—.</p>

<p>『Could it be that you had a fight with your childhood friend?』</p>
<p>『!? How did you know?』</p>
<p>『We used to talk about your childhood friend a lot over DM, but you haven’t mentioned anything for the past few days.』</p>
<p>『…As expected of Senpai. Still sharp as ever. And compared to that… I’m the worst. Fighting with Azusa and even making Senpai worry about me—』</p>
<p>『Have more confidence. I’ve thought about this since we talked in the park. Chifuyu, you have a complex about your childhood friend, but from my perspective, Chifuyu, you’re already an impressive person. You’ve put in enough effort, from studying anime and manga to have conversations with me to trying to change your appearance and personality. That diligent side of you, I deeply respect it——I like it.』</p>

<p>He encouraged me.</p>
<p>Even saying the ‘like’ that I longed to hear that night we met at the park.</p>

<p>Then, why should I just give up?</p>
<p>Lose my confidence and once again make excuses like ‘it can’t be helped,’ and run away?</p>

<p>(There’s no way I can do that!)</p>

<p>I don’t want to lose!</p>
<p>As Senpai said, I’ve been working hard on the piano all this time!</p>
<p>I ignite the remnants of pride as a pianist that still remain in my heart.</p>
<p>To not lose to my childhood friend beside me, I return with all my might.</p>

<p>Kazami Chifuyu in her prime.</p>
<p>When I wholeheartedly enjoyed playing the piano.</p>
<p>I’m going to recreate my performance from the days when I was known by the exaggerated nickname of ‘Piano Prodigy’.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Hey, Chifuyu.”</p>

<p>The black and white keys have turned into a battlefield.</p>
<p>Of course, I have no time to respond to Azusa’s voice.</p>
<p>Still, my best friend, dressed in a vivid red dress, continues speaking without stopping her hands.</p>

<p>“Chifuyu, you said you’re an ‘unreliable person,’ but that’s not true. Talking to you and playing together, those were irreplaceable times for me. I can’t even express how much they’ve meant to me as a source of support for my heart.”</p>

<p>Ah, no.</p>

<p>‘That’s the same for me too!’ I scream the words that I can’t voice out loud in my heart.</p>

<p>(I loved the time spent with Azusa!)</p>

<p>A comfortable relationship just from being together.</p>
<p>Kazami Chifuyu really loved Azusa Tomori.</p>

<p>(That’s why… I felt jealous of Kagisaka.)</p>

<p>I hated the idea of being the only one not special to Azusa.</p>
<p>I was anxious that Azusa might not want to be with me like before. That’s why, I wanted Azusa to rely on me more.</p>

<p>“——I’m sorry, Azusa.”</p>

<p>While playing, I managed to force out the words of apology that I had been unable to say for so long.</p>
<p>What flashes through my mind are the ugly words I threw at Azusa in my jealousy of Kagisaka. Ah, what a fool I am—</p>

<p>“Even if you apologize, I won’t forgive you.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>

<p>In response to my best friend’s declaration, I make my first mistake in playing today.</p>
<p>However, the audience doesn’t notice because Azusa covers for me and continues the performance.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to dislike you a bit more than before, Chifuyu. The words you said at the pool hurt me a lot.”</p>

<p>It’s not surprising.</p>
<p>I want to slap myself from that time too. I hurt Azusa that much…</p>

<p>“But, I’d never think of ending our friendship just because of that.”</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>“Even if I dislike you a little, I still love you, Chifuyu, so much more than that.”</p>

<p>Unintentionally, for just an instant, I shift my gaze from the keyboard to the side.</p>
<p>There, my beloved childhood friend Azusa Tomori was playing the piano with a smile.</p>

<p>(——Thank you)</p>

<p>I hurt you with such terrible words. It’s not something that can be easily forgiven or brushed aside.</p>
<p>Such convenient plot developments like those in anime or manga can’t happen in real human relationships…</p>

<p>(But——still, Azusa)</p>

<p>Even though you said you disliked me, you still want to be friends. You told me you loved me…</p>
<p>If that’s the case…</p>

<p>“Then I’ll do my best from now on. I’ll make up for the times you disliked me and try to make you like me again, Tomorin.”</p>

<p>Using the childhood nickname for my best friend, I continue to play the piano, and then Azusa stops playing.</p>
<p>She stopped helping me, but I didn’t stop my fingers.</p>
<p>The anxiety I felt offstage is nowhere to be found now.</p>
<p>Like when we were kids, wanting to be praised by Azusa, wanting to see Azusa smile, I pour my whole self into it, just like back then—single-mindedly, with my whole body in motion.</p>

<p>“——”</p>

<p>And then, the performance ends.</p>
<p>Immediately after——there is thunderous applause.</p>
<p>——Wowwwww! The arena is filled with a thunderstorm of applause and cheers.</p>
<p>As I look around the venue, I even see students crying, perhaps moved by the performance.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it, even Sadaoka is crying.”</p>
<p>“Did you change your opinion of Chifuyu after that performance?”</p>
<p>“Ugh… Seriously, you’re so quick to change your tune…”</p>

<p>And that’s where my words stop.</p>
<p>My childhood friend is sitting next to me with the usual bright smile. But what’s different this time is—</p>

<p>“Ah, ahaha, sorry. I somehow feel relieved; I’m just feel so relieved.”</p>

<p>The students watching from below the stage might not understand, but it was clear to me, right beside her.</p>
<p>It was the first time I saw Azusa cry…</p>

<p>“What’s wrong? Were you so happy to play a duet with me?”</p>
<p>“Of course! And with the performance we just did, it should have conveyed that me and Chifuyu have reconciled! This should calm down the anonymous bulletin boards!”</p>

<p>I didn’t understand the term ‘bulletin board,’ but if it’s Azusa——</p>

<p>(——Perhaps she helped me again in some way that I don’t know about.)</p>

<p>But I don’t feel a bit upset because there is something I can recognize more strongly than before.</p>
<p>The relationship between Kazami Chifuyu and Azusa Tomori. We are best friends.</p>
<p>So—.</p>

<p>“Hey, Azusa.”</p>

<p>We both stand up from our chairs and, after bowing to everyone in the center of the stage, I quietly speak.</p>

<p>“How about giving Kagisaka an answer to his confession right here, right now?”</p>

<p>Oh well, I can’t help but laugh at myself. I’m quite quick to change my stance.</p>
<p>But—surely.</p>
<p>Azusa playing the piano with me tonight must have something to do with what Kagisaka did.</p>
<p>To play such an unconventional performance at the prom, like selling a quarrel.</p>
<p>It’s bold and unconventional even for Azusa, who’s usually a model student.</p>

<p>I think Kagisaka must have suggested it.</p>
<p>After all, Kagisaka is Azusa’s partner.</p>
<p>He’s the guy Azusa acknowledged.</p>
<p>If I can accept that—.</p>

<p>“That confession from Kagisaka just now was really nice, you know.”</p>

<p>I ended up saying words that I wouldn’t have said even if I were dead, just until yesterday.</p>
<p>But right now, it’s my honest opinion without any lies.</p>
<p>Kimitaka Kagisaka’s confession was sincere, genuine, and filled with feelings.</p>

<p>“If it’s Kagisaka, I can trust Azusa with him.”</p>
<p>“Heh, what’s that? Is Chifuyu my guardian?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not. I’m Azusa’s friend. Always have been, always will be.”</p>
<p>“I see, but sorry, Chifuyu.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to be what you expect me to be.”</p>

<p>After saying that, Azusa asks the student council president, who comes from the side of the stage, for a microphone.</p>

<p>“Kagisaka-kun.”</p>

<p>And then.</p>
<p>My best friend, clad in a bright red dress, smiles with no hesitation, and then gives her response to the confession.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>I was left speechless right beside her. The rest of the students in the venue were probably the same.</p>
<p>Surely everyone was expecting Azusa to accept Kagisaka’s confession.</p>

<p>“I can’t be in a relationship with you.”</p>

<p>Azusa’s reply to Kagisaka, down on the stage, came exactly three seconds later.</p>
<p>The tremendous shock from everyone painted the entire venue.</p>

<p>“Wait, wait a minute…!”</p>

<p>What’s going on!?</p>
<p>‘You liked Kagisaka, didn’t you?!’ I wanted to shout that out, but I was so surprised that I couldn’t even speak.</p>
<p>From an angle that only I can see—</p>

<p>“——It’s fine, Chifuyu. Everything is according to Kagisaka-kun’s plan.”</p>

<p>‘Everyone’s Friends’ whispered to me without using the microphone, and then she stuck her tongue out a little and gave me a mischievous smile.</p>
