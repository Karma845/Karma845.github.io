<h2></h2>Chapter 8: Heresy</h2>
</div>


<p>In the end, I waited through the night, but Colette never returned to the dormitory.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t uncommon for students to not return to the dormitory on occasion, but because the person in question was Colette, a princess, the Academy was in an uproar over it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Lady Mylene!&#8221;</p>



<p>I was naively hoping she would somehow show up to class when Albert called out to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Albert… Your Highness. It may be a pointless question to ask, but would you happen to have seen Princess Colette?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…I have not.&#8221;</p>



<p>I clicked my tongue in annoyance. Albert knew where I was directing my frustrations, so he wasn&#8217;t panicked.</p>



<p>It had only been a day since she went off to investigate; since she hadn&#8217;t returned, things were likely worse than we thought.</p>



<p>In the first place, the group we&#8217;re dealing with would not hesitate to kill, so even if Colette was royalty, her safety wasn&#8217;t guaranteed… Rather, if I was right about their goal, then it was more that Colette, the princess of a powerful military-focused nation, was a perfect &#8216;sacrifice&#8217; for them to use.</p>



<p>But their goal didn&#8217;t concern me. What did was that they dared lay their hands on someone close to me. They couldn&#8217;t make me any angrier than they already did.</p>



<p>At this point I was too angry to even concentrate, and it would be like this the whole day; I&#8217;d gain nothing from sticking around for classes today.</p>



<p>Pelmann would prolly get even more upset since this would be the second day I&#8217;ve skipped out on classes, but…</p>



<p>&#8220;Tch…&#8221;</p>



<p>I clicked my tongue again, but really I knew what I had to do. There was no point in thinking any more about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Your Highness, could you let Instructor Pelmann know I will be absent for today&#8217;s classes as well? Please tell him I have left to search for Princess Colette.&#8221;</p>



<p>I no longer had the time nor the luxury for a careful investigation.</p>



<p>And with that in mind, I purposely tasked Albert with delivering my message…</p>



<p>&#8220;Pl-please wait for me, Lady Mylene! I will also..!&#8221;</p>



<p>I stopped Albert from finishing his sentence by bringing my face up close to his own.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you not understand? Let me make it clear to you if you didn&#8217;t: do not follow me.&#8221;</p>



<p>…so that I could force him to stay behind today.</p>



<p>I needed someone to tell Pelmann I would be absent, and I wanted Albert to stay behind; those were the two reasons why I ordered him to deliver my message.</p>



<p>&#8220;I… I cannot do that! I am your loyal follower, Lady Mylene, but those are not orders I can obey!&#8221;</p>



<p>But Albert refused to give in.</p>



<p>I really did like that he was finally showing some spine, that he didn&#8217;t just blindly follow my orders, and that he was willing to speak his mind. Really, if this had been about anything else, I would have praised him for it…</p>



<p>&#8220;Do I have to spell it out entirely before you understand? You will just be a burden if you come.&#8221;</p>



<p>…but our current circumstances are no good. The guys we&#8217;d be dealing with today were actually dangerous people &#8212; the kinds of people who wouldn&#8217;t think twice about killing us.</p>



<p>If I were on my own, I could move faster, more freely. I wouldn&#8217;t say I could do everything perfectly on my own, but I could figure it out along the way.</p>



<p>Bringing Albert, on the other hand, was opening myself up to unnecessary risk. In the worst case scenario, they could capture him and use him as a hostage.</p>



<p>&#8220;E-even so..! It was you who taught me the sword, Lady Mylene! Th-there is no way I would slow you down, so please..!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You do realize you&#8217;re already slowing me down like this, right? Just be a good boy and give up. You&#8217;re not yet strong enough.&#8221;</p>



<p>I answered him with annoyance when he still refused.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t dislike reckless guys, but I did dislike brats who didn&#8217;t know their own limits.</p>



<p>&#8220;St-still, I cannot give up! I know exactly how incapable I am, but even so, Princess Colette is still my friend! And even if I know it is you who will be going, Lady Mylene, I cannot just leave everything to a single girl to do, all alone. That… that is not something someone who is to become the ruler of a kingdom should do!&#8221;</p>



<p>Even so…</p>



<p>Albert still didn&#8217;t give up.</p>



<p>Really, it was impossible to deal with kids like this &#8212; brats that didn&#8217;t know their place.</p>



<p>Then again, maybe it was just in my nature, but I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to really hate this kind of naïveté.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you an idiot? The ruler &#8216;should be&#8217; the person who stays away from the battlefield, who issues orders from the back and in safety. Don&#8217;t just put yourself in danger because you suddenly feel like its the right thing to do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh…&#8221;</p>



<p>Did Albert finally understand? He seemed to deflate without an answer.</p>



<p>Well, knowing him, he would still follow me in secret, even if that meant going against everything I told him.</p>



<p>It was absolutely stupid for a king to do… but not a bad way to go for a man.</p>



<p>I finally pulled away from him and sighed in resignation. There was only one thing I could do then; I glanced around and noticed the male student sitting next to me, suspiciously peeking at us every so often.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um… Clive, was it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-yes, h-how may I help?!&#8221;</p>



<p>I called out to him when he next peeked.</p>



<p>The boy had been so self-conscious of his own suspiciousness that he immediately jumped to his feet, snapping to attention with a perfectly straight back as though he meant to salute us.</p>



<p>&#8220;Would you be so kind as to inform Instructor Pelmann that Prince Albert and I will be absent from classes today?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O-of course, ma&#8217;am! I-it would be my pleasure!&#8221;</p>



<p>For the record, this guy was just a classmate. I had no idea why he was so polite when he was from a noble family in a country I was unrelated to, but I put the thought aside as I stood from my seat.</p>



<p>&#8220;I shall be headed out then. Will you not also be coming?&#8221;</p>



<p>I stopped to call out to Albert, who stood as though in a daze.</p>



<p>After a long pause, his face relaxed with a wide smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah..! Of course! Thank you very much!&#8221;</p>



<p>And like that we departed the classroom and returned to the dormitory.</p>



<p>Today would probably be the day I had to use that frail rapier of mine…</p>





<p style="text-align:center;">◆</p>





<p>The town was as bright and bustling as ever when we arrived.</p>



<p>Really, the atmosphere was so lively that it was hard to believe there was a creeping drug problem beneath its surface.</p>



<p>From the point-of-view of the people living in this town, today was probably just another ordinary day.</p>



<p>Rather than a drug problem, all they knew was there was a new medicine making its way through the market &#8212; medicine that had only positives to it.</p>



<p>…I bet they had no idea that there were things going on right under their noses that would lead to the greatest war they had yet to know.</p>



<p>&#8220;So what now? Will we be using our disguises again today?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, we won&#8217;t be needing them today since we don&#8217;t need to be secretive about it anymore. We&#8217;ll start by finding a dealer, and we can have him tell us whatever we need.&#8221;</p>



<p>If we wanted to stop them, it was a matter of speed now.</p>



<p>It might&#8217;ve been possible we were too late, and the worst possible outcome had already come to pass, but… the only thing I knew now was that my friend&#8217;s life was at stake. I couldn&#8217;t just give up on her.</p>



<p>The two of us quickly made our way down the main street; unsurprisingly, there weren&#8217;t any dealers that would try and do their business out here in the open.</p>



<p>I wonder… would we run into that same guy from yesterday, the one who gave us the free samples?</p>



<p>There were probably many well-kept secrets about Ludus itself, and right now we had very little to go by. Yesterday&#8217;s dealer might be some low-ranking grunt in the group, but we should be able to force information out of him, since those types were usually the most loose-lipped of all.</p>



<p>We ducked into a side street, still headed for where we went yesteryday; the amount of people walking around had decreased considerably since leaving the main street.</p>



<p>I guess even the few people here were too many to have around at once.</p>



<p>We finally made it back to where we were yesterday, but there was no dealer in sight this time. I looked around, hoping to spot him or anyone else when I noticed an opening leading into a narrower alleyway.</p>



<p>It was unsurprising that worthless insects, like the hooded man from yesterday, preferred dark and gloomy hiding spots like this.</p>



<p>Without hesitation, I plunged forward, moving into and through the alley, when…</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s this? What&#8217;re the two of you doin&#8217; in a place like this, li&#8217;l noble girl and boy?&#8221;</p>



<p>Down at the end of the path, we found the dealer from yesterday. He didn&#8217;t seem to have any idea we were the pair he met yesterday, and he greeted us in a positive voice.</p>



<p>How sickeningly insolent. Whatever; it was time for me to make my move.</p>



<p>I quickly closed the distance between us, with only the sound of my heavy steps on the ground to answer him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you looking to get some Ludus? Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ve got som&#8211; oof!&#8221;</p>



<p>I drove my fist into the side of his face.</p>



<p>The punch flung the man back, seinding him crashing into the pile of barrels behind him.</p>



<p>Without regards to his safety, I drew closer before grabbing the front of his shirt with my hands. He moaned in pain.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh… you bitch! The hell are yo&#8211; gah!&#8221;</p>



<p>Without warning, I punched the other side of his face. He staggered in pain, and thin trails of blood trickled down each end of his mouth.</p>



<p>I saw his eyes water as he turned to spit something &#8212; a chipped tooth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eek..! Wh-wh-what are you..&#8221;</p>



<p>Judging from his reaction, I was certain now that he really was just a low-ranking grunt. But still, he should know some things at least.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some questions for you. About the stuff you&#8217;ve been peddling.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wh-what are you tryin&#8211; guh?!&#8221;</p>



<p>This time I slammed my fist straight onto his nose. Blood streamed freely from his now-flattened feature.</p>



<p>&#8220;M-muh nose…! I-id&#8217;s brogen..!&#8221;</p>



<p>He was cowering pathetically now, trying to hide away his face by shielding it behind his hands.</p>



<p>At this rate, it shouldn&#8217;t take much more to get him to start talking.</p>



<p>&#8220;Listen up: if you say anything unnecessary, I&#8217;ll beat you again. And if you say nothing, then I&#8217;ll still beat you. Got it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;G-god id…&#8221;</p>



<p>It took three hits for him to become obedient. They usually gave in after the second, but it was probably because I wasn&#8217;t as intimidating as I used to be.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you guys distributing those drugs? It clearly isn&#8217;t for money, so what&#8217;s your goal?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I don&#8217;t know..! No! Please! I really don&#8217;t! The important guys, the ones above me doin&#8217; it all! They&#8217;re a bunch o&#8217; lunatics! I&#8217;m jus&#8217; a dealer! I ain&#8217;t know nothin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>



<p>The man shrank back, shaking even harder, when I threatened him with a raised fist.</p>



<p>He really didn&#8217;t seem to know. Well, I guess small fry like this would sooner sell out what they knew if they really felt their life was in danger.</p>



<p>&#8220;L-like I said..! I&#8217;m j-jus&#8217; a grunt! I only get paid to give the stuff out! I ain&#8217;t know nothing, I swear!&#8221;</p>



<p>…He didn&#8217;t seem to be lying about it, either.</p>



<p>In the end, he really was just nobody in the organization, I guess. There was only so much information we could pull from someone like that.</p>



<p>&#8220;Next: do you even know what kind of drug it was you were handing out? I wouldn&#8217;t lie, if I were you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know anything..! I-I mean, I was told I shouldn&#8217;t use it because it gets in my head, but..&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That what the &#8216;guys above you&#8217; said?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-yeah… I would get paid if I ain&#8217;t say nothin&#8217; and jus&#8217; hand it out. They was havin&#8217; trouble findin&#8217; workers, so I jus&#8217; kept me mouth shut…&#8221;</p>



<p>So if it were all true, then my guess was right: this group or whatever really did just want to get Ludus spread as much as possible.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t know what it cost to make Ludus, but it was safe to assume they weren&#8217;t turning a profit through it. Considering they also had dealers on their payroll, this organization was probably losing tons of money because of this operation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Next: where do you go to resupply your stock when you run out?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Th-they got bases all over the city. I seen some people; they all wearing the same clothes, and they&#8217;re bringin&#8217; it in from somewhere…&#8221;</p>



<p>That would mean they could be producing Ludus themselves.</p>



<p>…This whole plot was turning out to be a larger operation than I&#8217;d suspected. Damn it all.</p>



<p>&#8220;One last thing: you talked to someone to get started handing out the drugs, right? Take me to them.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O-okay… b-but you gotta let me go after! I ain&#8217;t want them to know it was me..!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Pfft, like hell I will. You think I&#8217;ll trust that you aren&#8217;t just lying to run away?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please! I&#8217;m beggin&#8217; you here! They&#8217;ll kill me if they knew!&#8221;</p>



<p>His desperation made it obvious that the group he worked for really was that kind of cutthroat organization.</p>



<p>But… that wasn&#8217;t my problem at all. In the first place, why would I have any sympathy for these people? They know they&#8217;re doing wrong, and they keep doing it anyway for the money.</p>



<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t be a problem. After all, today&#8217;s their last day. I&#8217;m bringing the whole thing down.&#8221;</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t know what kind of organization I&#8217;d be facing, but it was all the same to me once I was done with them.</p>



<p>Well, it might not be the entire organization, but whatever part of it that operated in this town would be gone, at least.</p>



<p>Oh, this guy&#8217;s trying to waste our time again. So…</p>



<p>&#8220;D-don&#8217;t hit me anymore… Please…&#8221;</p>



<p>I hit him on the nose again, and he was more than willing to cooperate now.</p>





<p style="text-align:center;">◆</p>





<p>&#8220;I-it&#8217;s here… I d-don&#8217;t know about any other places…&#8221;</p>



<p>The dealer had stumbled forward and guided us around, eventually arriving at a place he claimed to be where the drugs were distributed.</p>



<p>At first glance, it looked like a perfectly ordinary house, but… upon closer look, between the heavy curtains blocking the windows and the distinct lack of clear openings, this was most definitely a suspicious-looking place.</p>



<p>&#8220;We come here an&#8217; get more drugs to sell… but I know it&#8217;s them hooded guys who&#8217;re the ones bringing them in…&#8221;</p>



<p>Hooded guys&#8217; huh? Were they like the hooded man we saw yesterday, the one that left the other guy for dead?</p>



<p>And the fact that they were both in hooded robes… was that like their uniform or something? I suppose there was no more denying that this was a big group handling everything.</p>



<p>With that in mind, I decided on what we needed to do next.</p>



<p>We would attack this place. If we happened to find Colette here, then everything was settled. If not, then I can just find out by having another conversation with one of the guys in this house. That was what it meant to search.</p>



<p>&#8220;All right then, good for you, you did what you were told. You&#8217;re free to go after I&#8217;m finished here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;R-really?!&#8221;</p>



<p>I playfully patted the man&#8217;s back, and he smiled with pure joy.</p>



<p>Well, if the worst has happened to Colette, then my next goal was revenge. If that happened, I wouldn&#8217;t just let this guy go, and I&#8217;d hunt him down for it. But that wasn&#8217;t important right now; I didn&#8217;t need to focus on a mere underling just yet.</p>



<p>But I did plan on getting a bit more use out of him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you know anything about this place?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know a bit o&#8217; the ground floor, I guess.&#8221;</p>



<p>I asked him about the layout of the house.</p>



<p>…It seemed fairly clear to me, and with that, I&#8217;ve got a rough idea of what I can do.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-was that good enough?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yep, it was fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>He sighed in relief after hearing my answer.</p>



<p>It was true though; I knew enough about the building itself.</p>



<p>&#8220;All right, Albert, we&#8217;ll be going for a frontal assault here. You ready?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A frontal assault? …I understand. You must have a plan in mind.&#8221;</p>



<p>I checked with Albert to make sure he was prepared, and he nodded his readiness.</p>



<p>Everything was in place and ready then.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, trash, you&#8217;re done here. As promised, you&#8217;re free to go &#8212; after you do one more thing for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? Wh-wha&#8211;?!&#8221;</p>



<p>I picked him up, lifting him onto my shoulder as I ignored his surprise.</p>



<p>He tried to resist by wriggling about, but it was impossible for him to escape once I had him in place like this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go, Albert!&#8221;</p>



<p>It had been some time since I was last in a real fight, so I might end up going overboard here.</p>



<p>I called out to Albert to encourage him. I peeked at the man caught in my arms and stifled a chuckle… before throwing him at a window.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aaaahhhh!!&#8221;</p>



<p>The man screamed in panic as his body flew into the window, smashing it open.</p>



<p>He crashed through in an explosion of glass and wall.</p>



<p>At the same time, I kicked down the wooden door of the house.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yo! Look alive, people! It&#8217;s raid time!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wha&#8211;?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s this brat?! W-wait, that hair, it can&#8217;t be..!&#8221;</p>



<p>As I entered, there were three men standing around, wearing hooded robes.</p>



<p>Like that man had said, the guys in charge of handing out the drugs to the dealers were all wearing the same thing.</p>



<p>But that wasn&#8217;t important right now.</p>



<p>Rather, it was important that I keep my momentum going while they were confused.</p>



<p>And so I leapt into action, springing into the leftmost man.</p>



<p>He was slow to react, clumsily reaching for a weapon, but it was to be expected; not many people could respond immediately when a situation suddenly turned chaotic.</p>



<p>I channeled magical power into my hand before punching into his jaw; there was the sound of crunching bone, and I saw teeth and blood burst from his mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;You bitch..!&#8221;</p>



<p>The next man, who was standing by the door, raised his sword.</p>



<p>But unfortunately, he would not be swinging it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Urgh?! The ceiling..?!&#8221;</p>



<p>It took a certain amount of skill to use longer weapons in tight spaces like this.</p>



<p>And that had been my intent: people who have trained a certain way for a long enough time would fall back on muscle memory, just like this.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for them, that meant drawing their weapons in a small space, something they probably have never trained for.</p>



<p>As an aside, that was also why I hadn&#8217;t drawn my rapier and instead settled for my fists.</p>



<p>&#8220;Too slow, idiot!&#8221;</p>



<p>While he floundered about in confusion, I dove in and smashed his abdomen. He bent over from the blow, and I delivered a half-moon kick to his face.</p>



<p>Now only one left; I looked over and saw Albert already entangled with him.</p>



<p>Though he wasn&#8217;t as flashy as I was, Albert was keeping the man at bay with his rapier.</p>



<p>I used my fists because it was simply easier, but in an environment like this, rapiers were especially effective: whereas random objects would get in the way of an effective attack, a rapier, specialized in pinpoint thrusts, could very easily weave through would-be obstacles to land a hit. Albert, despite the spoiled prince he was, was not only educated but had also gone through my training, and he was making use of his rapier&#8217;s effectiveness; he was looking like a pretty reliable fighter like this.</p>



<p>Assuming this last guy was like the other two, Albert would probably win even without my help thanks to the natural advantage rapiers had in situations like this, but…</p>



<p>…There was no need to make it a fair fight!</p>



<p>I snuck around to the guy and grabbed hold of his arms, twisting them around as I threw him down to the ground.</p>



<p>&#8220;Woah?!&#8221;</p>



<p>He crashed chest-first into the ground and moaned in pain as I mounted his back with his arms still caught.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good job, Albert. You&#8217;ve made this a lot easier.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was an honor to help, Lady Mylene.&#8221;</p>



<p>Well, things wouldn&#8217;t be that much different if Albert hadn&#8217;t been here.</p>



<p>But it was true that he made things easier for me: we now had one guy subdued but conscious, ready to interrogate.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh… You… Wait, that hair…! You must be Mylene Petyul!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Heh, not bad. Seems like you know a bit about brats from different places, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kuh..! Even the way you talk is barbaric! I should have expected no less from Iltania&#8217;s lowly mutt!&#8221;</p>



<p>My attack had left him choking for breath, but he still wore a patronizing sneer.</p>



<p>In the Kingdom of Iltania, the Hair of Sulberia was the mark of God&#8217;s chosen one, but to other countries, it was just an indication of someone with great magical power.</p>



<p>And yet, this guy knew who I was as soon as he saw my hair.</p>



<p>…I knew I&#8217;d find these kinds of people near me at some point, but I hadn&#8217;t realized they were already this close.</p>



<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s how you feel, I don&#8217;t really care. I still got some questions for you to answer.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wh-who would answer your questions?!&#8221;</p>



<p>He seemed more resolute than the other guy; the face that stared defiantly back at me seemed rather determined.</p>



<p>It was the kind of stubborn face that really would refuse to give in… In other words, an actual pain in the ass.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>Well, that wasn&#8217;t my problem, so I casually tore off a fingernail from the hand I held twisted in place.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eeee?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, aren&#8217;t you quite the resiliant one? I bet that one probably hurt.&#8221;</p>



<p>I flicked it away, and the nail made dry clicking noises as it bounced across the wooden floor.</p>



<p>I mean, I didn&#8217;t have much of a choice if he wasn&#8217;t going to talk.</p>



<p>&#8220;It breaks my heart to do this &#8212; it really does &#8212; but if your mouth isn&#8217;t talking, I gotta ask your body. Ah, what a shame…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Damn you, Iltania&#8217;s Hound! You will not break me! My faith keeps me strong!&#8221;</p>



<p>He seemed to be trying to convince himself, but it just sounded like desperate wailing to me.</p>



<p>Still, I already learned something from him: &#8216;Iltania&#8217;s Hound&#8217;, huh? I guess that was what he, no, what his religion called me? Maybe to them, the Hair of Sulberia was something bad.</p>



<p>So would that mean they were spreading Ludus as a way to undermine me? I should ask about that later, but first there were more important things to get to.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since you seem to know who I am, I&#8217;ll get right to the point: what did you do to Colette?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>



<p>Playing dumb, huh? That &#8216;faith&#8217; of his sure was great. I started to wonder how strong it would hold if I plucked another of his nails.</p>



<p>I guess I had no other choice… Torturing people wasn&#8217;t a hobby of mine, but I would have to get into it if I wanted answers.</p>



<p>I remembered learning about torture techniques back when I was still a merc. Looking back, it was actually a pretty gross experience.</p>



<p>It had been when I joined a bandit subjugation campaign; they were trying to get information out of some captives, and… they had done some pretty nasty stuff.</p>



<p>I really didn&#8217;t want to do what they did back then, but we were in a pretty tight spot, so I guess I&#8217;d have to make the best of it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Second one, there it goes!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh… Aghh!!&#8221;</p>



<p>I casually announced it before tearing off another nail.</p>



<p>This time around, he couldn&#8217;t stay quiet. How many more would we go through before he talked…</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s try again: what did you do to Colette?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll… I&#8217;ll never tal&#8211; gah!!&#8221;</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t want to keep asking, so I went ahead and tore off another.</p>



<p>In the end, he hadn&#8217;t talked, even after the fifth nail.</p>



<p>&#8220;Pretty stubborn, huh? You made it through your entire hand without cracking.&#8221;</p>



<p>Going by his glare, he didn&#8217;t seem to appreciate my joke, but there was a faint trace of relief in his expression.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t want to waste any more time on this, and at this rate, it would take way too long.</p>



<p>As I let out a deliberate sigh of exasperation, I could see the corners of the man&#8217;s mouth begin turning upward; he seemed to believe he had the upper hand now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, well, guess I have no choice now but to try a little harder now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, wha..?! Ack.. aaahhh?!&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course, that hadn&#8217;t meant the pain was over for him.</p>



<p>Rather, it meant moving on to the next step: breaking the bones of each finger, twisting them slowly, one-by-one, and deforming them bit-by-bit until they snapped with a loud crunching noise.</p>



<p>The key to a successful torture… was making them believe the pain would never end.</p>



<p>They wouldn&#8217;t die; it would just be one long period of hellish torment after another.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gah… Kah..!&#8221;</p>



<p>He was already moaning in pain. I didn&#8217;t blame him; even I would have been crying out at this point.</p>



<p>But the problem was getting him to tell me what I wanted to know, and I was already getting irritated by how slowly he was answering.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little late to be saying, but I am torturing you. If you&#8217;re still not talking after this, I&#8217;ll do the same to your left hand, and then each arm, and then I&#8217;ll start from the bottom, moving up from your toes and all the way to your eyes and ears. There won&#8217;t be any part of you that won&#8217;t be hurt. And you know, even if you don&#8217;t talk… I still got your two buddies over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>I leaned in to whisper into his ear like I was scolding him, and as I drew back, I could see the light of hope fade from his eyes.</p>



<p>Only terror remained.</p>



<p>&#8220;A little while ago, weren&#8217;t you saying something about how your faith wouldn&#8217;t be shaken? I find it a wonderful idea &#8212; that you would sacrifice yourself and endure like this to protect something important.&#8221;</p>



<p>I spoke gently to him, explaining it all in a single breath.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m such a good person, I&#8217;ll tell you something important: even if you did endure this all to the very end, there isn&#8217;t any guarantee those two will be able to, you know? You can still be fixed up as you are, so don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;d be better for the both of us if you talked now?&#8221;</p>



<p>I offered him the carrot and the stick. His face paled as he realized I was implying there would do things that no amount of treatment could fix.</p>



<p>It was good that he was so quick on the uptake, but it was possible that learning he had an out was what caused his reaction.</p>



<p>Seeing the possibility of ending this brutal torture must have seemed like a forbidden temptation; I didn&#8217;t know what the whole &#8216;Iltania&#8217;s Hound&#8217; thing was all about, but I would bet that giving him this offer made me seem like a real demon.</p>



<p>&#8220;So allow me to ask you once again: where is Princess Colette?&#8221;</p>



<p>The faint hope he showed ealier was completely gone; it must have finally set in that even if he martyred himself here, his sacrifice would potentially mean nothing.</p>



<p><em>Even if I stayed quiet and endured, how do I know those two will?</em> &#8212; was probably what he was thinking, and that doubt probably made it impossible for him to maintain his resolve.</p>



<p>He opened his mouth like he wanted to say something but closed it. I was fed up when he did it a second time, and I moved my hand to his middle finger.</p>



<p>&#8220;O-okay, okay! I&#8217;ll talk! Just, please..!&#8221;</p>



<p>In that moment, he had completely broken: not his fingers, but his heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yesterday… S-someone said we had caught the Princess of Colhoun. Th-they probably took her to the warehouse, not here. She should still be there…&#8221;</p>



<p>By &#8216;warehouse&#8217;, he probably meant where they were storing Ludus.</p>



<p>That being said, it sounded like Colette had gotten pretty close to solving it all herself, only to fail and got captured at the end.</p>



<p>Well, shit, that wasn&#8217;t good. I mentally clicked my tongue in annoyance.</p>



<p>&#8220;And what about now? Have you guys done anything to her?&#8221;</p>



<p>Since he was finally compliant, there was no need for me to threaten him any further, so I began asking questions in my usual tone.</p>



<p>&#8220;She wasn&#8217;t unharmed, but she should still be alive… Because of who she is, we hadn&#8217;t decided on what to do with her, but I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;ve done anything by now.&#8221;</p>



<p>And like that he confirmed the most important point: Colette&#8217;s safety. Still, I wasn&#8217;t completely relieved after hearing his words.</p>



<p>…Were they planning on making an enemy out of the Colhoun Empire? If they had resolved themselves to it, that would make them far more dangerous than I thought.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tch… whatever. One last question: where is that warehouse?&#8221;</p>



<p>Although there was more that I wanted to ask, there wasn&#8217;t the time for it.</p>



<p>The sooner I found Colette, the sooner the danger would all be over.</p>



<p>As for these guys&#8217; goal… Well, we could just figure it all out later.</p>



<p>&#8220;On the west side of town, there is a stone building, marked with a symbol of our god, the horned snake…&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the man didn&#8217;t even hesitate to reveal the location of their warehouse.</p>



<p>And that was all I needed to know.</p>



<p>That symbol he mentioned though &#8212; it sounded familiar. Out of curiosity, I turned the man over.</p>



<p>A horned snake, he said… If I remembered right, didn&#8217;t the hooded guy from yesterday wear a pendant with something like that?</p>



<p>&#8220;Wh-what is it now?&#8221;</p>



<p>I had him face up now, and sure enough, there was a pendant around his neck.</p>



<p>And on the pendant was the horned snake he just mentioned… This was their god?</p>



<p>The name of a certain pagan deity came to mind as I linked this symbol to the &#8216;faith&#8217; he kept talking about earlier.</p>



<p>&#8220;Dia Myrth…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What the..?! How do you know the name of our God?!&#8221;</p>



<p>The man responded violently to the name I had muttered without thinking.</p>



<p>Seeing his reaction, I felt my face twist with disgust, but I made no attempt to hide it.</p>



<p>Ugh, now I knew for sure things were much worse than I&#8217;d first thought.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard enough. Go take a nap.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-wait! Why are you doing all of this?!&#8221;</p>



<p>I answered him with a fist to his lower jaw, and he fell silent.</p>



<p>&#8220;Lady Mylene..?&#8221;</p>



<p>I yanked the horned snake medallion off the chain and pocketed it before slowly rising and turning to face Albert, who had called out to me with a puzzled look on his face.</p>



<p>It only dawned on me just now that he had been here this entire time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did I scare you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, not at all. In fact, your interrogation technique was incredible that I had no doubt of your success, Lady Mylene. But what did concern me was how he reacted when you knew about his religion.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was worried seeing the torture might have been too stimulating for a prince like Albert, but he had waved it off and mentioned something completely different instead.</p>



<p>And to that, I wasn&#8217;t sure of how to answer.</p>



<p>It would have been simple to just answer that I knew about the cult the man belonged to.</p>



<p>But I couldn&#8217;t exactly say that because… the cult had not yet revealed itself.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if they continue to grow until they became as they did in the history I remembered, then it was only a matter of time before a confrontation between us happened, and Albert would no doubt become involved as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;Have you ever heard of something called &#8216;the Gods of the Moon&#8217;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The gods of the moon… Hm, I cannot say I am familiar with the name…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only learned about them recently myself, so I&#8217;m not surprised you don&#8217;t. Well, they also seem to be the kind of people who don&#8217;t want to be found.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although my memories of it all were beginning to fade, I was still able to remember the names of certain things thanks to how commonplace they had become in the final days of Iltania.</p>



<p>In the first place, we should still be a long time away from when they first revealed themselves, and I didn&#8217;t know for sure if they would still use that same name.</p>



<p>&#8220;The only things I know are that they worship a horned snake they call Dia Myrth and that they seem to hate every other religion, going as far as calling the Iltanian faith a heretical religion.&#8221;</p>



<p>Their beliefs had led to their hostility toward the the Iltanian faith and anything associated with it.</p>



<p>Seeing as that guy was calling me Iltania&#8217;s Hound after seeing my hair, I was convinced the cult was the same Gods of the Moon group from back then.</p>



<p>&#8220;In summary, they&#8217;re a pagan cult. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re very active at the moment, but they&#8217;re probably the ones behind the spread of Ludus that we&#8217;ve seen. They&#8217;re bad people, basically.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yep, that was the best way to describe them: a pagan cult full of bad people.</p>



<p>But did they hate the Iltanian faith because it had been convenient for them, or did they hate it because it was actually part of their beliefs?</p>



<p>I had done my best to stay away from those freaks back then, so I didn&#8217;t know for sure. What I did know was how they whispered their honeyed words into the ears of any who would listen and so easily spread their doomsday prophecies.</p>



<p>And many of those guys had called Mylene some weird names, too, in those final days.</p>



<p>&#8220;So they consider our faith heretical… Did they distribute their drug to the students of the Academy as a means to hurt us?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have no idea about that. I can&#8217;t even say for certain if these guys are a part of that group in the first place… Damn it all, I should have asked about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>If I had realized it sooner, I definitely could&#8217;ve asked, but… our primary objective here was rescuing Colette.</p>



<p>And right now, we didn&#8217;t have the time for unrelated topics like that.</p>



<p>&#8220;We should go. There&#8217;ll be plenty of time to find out more about these guys after we&#8217;ve confirmed Colette&#8217;s safety.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. I shall follow your lead.&#8221;</p>



<p>Still, it was disturbing to find that first Ludus and now the cult were already lurking about, when they had only appeared later in the future.</p>



<p>…Well, whatever; it didn&#8217;t really matter. My goal in this life was to destroy any that would get in my way. There wasn&#8217;t a need for me to worry so much about the details.</p>



<p>At any rate, they weren&#8217;t going to go quietly. But that wasn&#8217;t a bad thing; this would be a good chance to test out the power I&#8217;ve aquired, after all.</p>



<p>I tightly gripped the horned snake medallion in silence.</p>



<p>The cold metal dug into my slender fingers. What I wanted was power that not even the gods could stop. That was the current me&#8217;s objective.</p>



<p>Loosening my grip, I let the medal fall out of my hands.</p>



<p>I had to make sure Colette was safe. I hated this feeling of helplessness, of being able to do nothing.</p>



<p>I wouldn&#8217;t pray to God, but as I left this house, I found myself wishing for my friend&#8217;s safety.</p>
