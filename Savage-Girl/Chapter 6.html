<h1>Chapter 6: Pool Date Crisis</h1>


<p>《Tomohō——!》</p>
<p>《K-kun and a pool date, yayyyyyyy! Thank you, C-chan! I love you, I really, really love you! You’ve passed the job offer to be the representative for your friend’s speech at the wedding ceremony!》</p>
<p>《Today, I will show you that I can get even closer to K-kun! He probably doesn’t expect me to be in such a dating mood!》</p>

<p>“No, he probably does.”</p>

<p>Under the Sunday blue sky, having changed into swimsuits and rash guards, I looked at my smartphone inside a waterproof case and couldn’t help but retort.</p>

<p>Yomisaka Land.</p>
<p>15 minutes by bus from Shin-Himegaoka to Yomisaka Station, two stops ahead.</p>
<p>It’s a leisure complex with an amusement park and several pools. It’s incredibly lively on weekends.</p>
<p>Today’s highest temperature is 35 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly a scorching summer day, perfect for the pool.</p>

<p>“Sorry for making you wait.”</p>

<p>As I turned around in response to the voice, my breath was taken away.</p>
<p>Coming out of the changing room was Azusa Tomori in a swimsuit.</p>

<p>The people around us exclaimed in admiration.</p>
<p>Though she was revealing, it wasn’t provocative and not obnoxious.</p>
<p>Still, her slender figure caught my eye. Her waist was as graceful, just like an hourglass, and her two bulges were beautifully rounded.</p>
<p>The scarlet bikini suited Tomori so well that it was shining dazzlingly under the July sun.</p>

<p>“You brought a waterproof smartphone with you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah? You did too?”</p>
<p>“I thought it might come in handy if we got separated. By the way, Bocchi-kun, you’re still as clueless as ever.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s gotten into you all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“When a normal girl changes into a swimsuit, you’re supposed to compliment her, you know?”</p>
<p>“My bad. I just couldn’t find the right words.”</p>
<p>“I see… Could it be that you were fascinated by it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, even a horse can be dressed, I thought.”</p>

<p>I made a light-hearted remark as if trying to cover up my momentary captivation.</p>
<p>Surely, Tomori’s sharp-tongued retort was on its way.</p>

<p>“Hmm, so you mean to say I looked cute right now?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I said, did I look cute?”</p>
<p>“…Well, it suits you.”</p>
<p>“Oh really~. So you complimented me, huh? That’s making me a bit anxious~”</p>
<p>“You’re getting carried away.”</p>
<p>“I come here to play often, you know. Chifuyu, Suzuka, the members of the club I helped, and the other student council members, among others.”</p>
<p>“You’re still as much of a social butterfly as ever.”</p>
<p>“Is that something you envy, being a gray and gloomy youth? It was so much fun~ We even played the English-ban game with the student council members… Ah.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? “</p>
<p>“Ah, I forgot to buy drinks. I’ll go get some real quick.”</p>

<p>Without wasting a moment, Tomori ran while her chestnut-brown bob cut swayed softly.</p>

<p>(Did she go looking for a vending machine?)</p>

<p>No, she said she had been here many times before, so she should remember the location.</p>
<p>As expected of ‘Everyone’s friend.’</p>
<p>She has been enjoying a lively youth until now.</p>

<p>《Crazy~! K-kun said it ‘suits me’~!》</p>
<p>《Bring me some rice! I can have as many servings as I want with just that comment!》</p>
<p>《No way, I’m too happy! I’m so delighted I feel like grinning and can’t help but run away!》</p>

<p>“You’re getting too excited.”</p>

<p>What does she mean by she comes here to play often?</p>
<p>Well, since it’s Tomori, she’ll probably just be tweeting nonsense.</p>

<p>In other words, even if she’s planning something to get closer to me, I’ll see right through it.</p>
<p>Tomori’s goal is to make me confess to her.</p>
<p>I feel bad for my partner, but there’s no way it will turn out like that.</p>

<p>《No, be cool, me.》</p>
<p>《Of course, getting closer to K-kun is important.》</p>
<p>《But making sure K-kun enjoys himself is even more important, right?》</p>

<p>Huh?</p>

<p>《The issue with the secret website still isn’t resolved…》</p>
<p>《He might be feeling down due to cyberbullying.》</p>
<p>《That’s why, let’s do our best to make today as enjoyable as possible!! I want K-kun to smile at the end of the day and say, ‘I had a great time, I’m glad I came!’ 》</p>


<p>Indeed, there’s no straightforward solution to the issue with the secret website.</p>
<p>In truth, I haven’t told Tomori yet, but I’ve come up with a few ideas…</p>

<p>(But they come with various high risks.)</p>

<p>I still couldn’t bring myself to talk.</p>
<p>I didn’t really care about the cyberbullying…or so I thought.</p>

<p>“You’re too nice, Azusa Tomori.”</p>

<p>Trying to make me enjoy myself, huh?</p>
<p>I didn’t realize she had been paying attention to me to this extent.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, ever since I entered high school, I’ve never laughed so wholeheartedly, but after receiving such a comment, I can’t help but want to respond——°</p>

<p>(No, this is not good.)</p>

<p>Deepening our relationship any further would go against the rules.</p>

<p>“Hmm?”</p>

<p>And then, I noticed something strange.</p>

<p>“Sorry for making you wait… What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“My smartphone is acting up. It won’t connect to the Internet.”</p>

<p>Is there something wrong with it?</p>

<p>“Whoa, mine too! It suddenly lost internet connection.”</p>
<p>“Huh, mine is fine though.”</p>

<p>A perplexed voice came from a group of university students walking beside us.</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, last night I had trouble connecting to the internet too.”</p>

<p>If that’s the case, it might be a network outage.</p>
<p>There could be some issue with the services of the mobile company we both use… Wait, I can’t believe it.</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>My premonition was right.</p>
<p>Tomori, who was next to me, was frantically trying to deal with her smartphone inside the waterproof case.</p>

<p>“You can’t connect to the internet either?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it seems that way. It’s annoying, haha…”</p>

<p>While she put on a smile, her adorable face was covered in cold sweat. It’s understandable.</p>
<p>Tomori had been suppressing her confession to me by expressing her feelings through her secret account.</p>
<p>But during the network outage, she couldn’t use her secret account.</p>

<p>“Let’s just go swimming for now! Standing around here won’t get us anywhere!”</p>
<p>Tomori pointed to the pool, trying to change the mood.</p>

<p>(Well, I guess she can manage for a day?)</p>

<p>Even if she can’t use her secret account for a while, I think it won’t have any immediate impact.</p>

<p>“Hey! K-kun!?”</p>
<p>“!? “</p>
<p>“Ah… D-don’t be so surprised! Um, I was just teasing you. I tried calling you by a nickname, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Anyway, let’s go swimming already!? I’ve been really looking forward to playing with you today!”</p>

<p>She’s acting so differently all of a sudden.</p>
<p>The Tomori I know would never say those things out loud!</p>

<p>“Wow, she’s bold!”</p>
<p>“She’s making her move~”</p>
<p>“Isn’t she cute? Like a celebrity? Her appearance is so striking, and she looks great in a swimsuit.”</p>
<p>“Probably a high school student. It’s nice to be in your youth.”</p>

<p>Whispers came from a group of college-looking girls.</p>

<p>“N-no! I was just teasing you, that’s all…!”</p>

<p>It was a painfully awkward excuse that made her seem on the verge of choking.</p>
<p>Perhaps aware of it herself, Tomori blushed with embarrassment and fell silent.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>(…what should I do?)</p>

<p>Tomori doesn’t casually open her mouth.</p>
<p>If we can’t have a proper conversation, we won’t be able to enjoy ourselves fully.</p>

<p>(No)</p>

<p>Actually, this might be convenient for me.</p>
<p>If I can’t talk to Tomori, our distance won’t close.</p>
<p>However, [let’s do our best to make today as enjoyable as possible.]</p>
<p>What popped into my head was the tweet from her secret account.</p>
<p>(—I can’t do that.)</p>
<p>I can’t ignore her since I see her sincere intention like that.</p>

<p>“Since we’re here, let’s play a game, Tomori.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Sure, I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“Remember when you came here with the student council members before, and we played the English-ban game? Let’s add a twist to it.”</p>
<p>“What kind of twist?”</p>
<p>“A ban on harsh words. Today, whoever uses harsh words the most will have a penalty.”</p>
<p>“What!?!”</p>

<p>For a moment, Tomori was surprised, but then she immediately smiled.</p>

<p>“Nice! That’s a good idea Kagisaka-kun!.”</p>

<p>As expected of the honor student, her mind works quickly.</p>
<p>She quickly understood the advantages of this game.</p>
<p>Yes, with the premise of banning harsh words, it would be okay for Tomori to express her true feelings a bit.</p>

<p>——I’m lying to avoid speaking sarcastically!</p>

<p>That’s because she can use excuses like that.</p>

<p>“Well then, how about I call you ‘K-kun’ all day today~?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Oh? I was just trying to avoid sarcasm by calling you using a nickname. Are you embarrassed, perhaps?”</p>
<p>“No way.”</p>

<p>You’re quite the strategist, Tomori.</p>
<p>She quickly recovered from the pinch and adapted to the game.</p>
<p>However, it’s really painful that only I feel embarrassed.</p>

<p>“It’s not like that, Azuazu.”</p>
<p>“!”</p>

<p>Enduring my embarrassment, I came up with a nickname on the spot and called her that.</p>
<p>She responded with a cute little whine, like a Dachshund being poked in the belly.</p>

<p>“Wha, Azuazu…!?”</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s wrong? I was just trying to avoid harsh words by calling you using a nickname. Are you embarrassed, perhaps?”</p>
<p>“…Haa? There’s no way, okay?”</p>
<p>“Then let’s go, Azuazu.”</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Azuazu? Your face looks like a red light.”</p>
<p>“Y-you bastard! You really have the worst personality! Calling me by a nickname repeatedly in such a crowded place…”</p>
<p>“Yes, harsh words. Minus one point.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>“At school, you’re often called by nicknames countless times. Is it that embarrassing?”</p>
<p>“…it can’t be helped. Being called such a nickname by you… It’s the first time.”</p>
<p>“So that’s why you launched a verbal attack. I see; now I understand the strategy of the game. If I say something that embarrasses Azuazu, she’ll self-destruct on her own.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, K-kun is so kind. You’re telling me your game strategy even though I’m your enemy.”</p>

<p>Then, Tomori added,</p>

<p>“But I also have a plan, you know?”</p>

<p>Tomori took my hand, and we started walking toward the midsummer pool.</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>Round ①, Lazy Pool.</p>

<p>“The water is so refreshing and cold~. ——Oops!”</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry. I slipped and lost my balance.”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie. Didn’t you purposely hug my arm?”</p>
<p>“I thought that if I embarrassed you, you might say something nasty.”</p>
<p>“Don’t steal other people’s strategies.”</p>
<p>“By the way, why are you wearing a rash guard?”</p>
<p>“Just because? It’s for sun protection——”</p>
<p>“Wow… I’m surprised. K-kun, your abs are amazing. They are so well-defined.”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t just lift my rash guard so openly——”</p>
<p>“Can I touch them?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“If you let me touch them… you can touch my stomach, too?”</p>
<p>“What kind of equivalent exchange is this? Have you turned into a seductress or something?”</p>
<p>“Yes, harsh word. Minus one point.”</p>
<p>“Hey…”</p>
<p>“What? Are you regretting saying something bad?”</p>
<p>“Not like that. Stop casually stroking my body.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. It’s underwater, so no one can see.”</p>
<p>“Is that the problem?”</p>
<p>“Wow… as I thought, they’re really firm…”</p>
<p>“!?—Good. In that case…”</p>
<p>“Hyaa! Why are you touching my belly…!”</p>
<p>“You said it was okay to touch.”</p>
<p>“The way you touched was too suggestive!”</p>
<p>“I just used Azuazu’s movement as a reference.”</p>
<p>“You…!”</p>
<p>“You’re ticklish huh…?!”</p>
<p>“Kyaa! Haha, you shouldn’t tickle me!”</p>

<p>Round ②, Water Slider.</p>

<p>“Since we’re here, let’s slide together.”</p>
<p>“Don’t joke around. Sliding with you would be a tortur——”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“——an enticing offer?”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you about to say it’s torture?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. It’s because the line is long, so we’ll be waiting for a while.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… I have an idea. While we’re waiting, let’s talk about otaku stuff!”</p>
<p>“Huh? Are you serious? The honor student Azuazu?”</p>
<p>“I read all the volumes of the manga ‘Chainsaw Man’ that you recommended the other day.”</p>
<p>“Really? How was it?”</p>
<p>“It was incredibly entertaining! The way the characters were portrayed was so skillful! They made the readers deeply emotionally involved and then hit them with sudden developments. The ending of Part 1 was especially shocking. There were also parts that moved me to tears, so I read the borrowed volumes from Chifuyu and cried alone late at night.”</p>
<p>“Well done. I just recommended it recently, and you’ve read all the volumes…”</p>
<p>“Hehe. I wanted to have lots of otaku discussions with K-kun, so this amount of effort is nothing for me.”</p>
<p>“By the way, did you watch the anime too?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, the opening theme was so cool!”</p>
<p>“I agree. Did you notice? The OP had many parodies of movies in it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was stylish and fantastic!”</p>
<p>“The author seems to be a movie fan, so they probably chose those movie parodies with a purpose… Ah”</p>
<p>“Whoops. It’s almost our turn.”</p>
<p>“We were so engrossed in chatting that time flew by.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! When I’m talking with K-kun, I forget the time because it’s so much fun!”</p>

<p> </p>


<p>Round ③, Wave Pool.</p>

<p>“Hey, K-kun, lend me your chest for a moment.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Hey, Azuazu, why are you suddenly hugging—”</p>
<p>“That guy over there, who looks like a playboy, is staring at me. Probably trying to pick someone up. So, I’m going for the ‘I have a boyfriend’ move.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that too straightforward?”</p>
<p>“We’re in a cold pool, so it’s fine, right? Let’s sway with the waves like this for a while.”</p>
<p>“Rejected. Not just university students but even the people around us are giving us curious looks. They’ll surely think we’re a silly couple—”</p>
<p>“Hey, K-kun, what do you like about me?”</p>
<p>“Listen to what others are saying.”</p>
<p>“This is also a lover’s appeal. If you don’t answer, I won’t let go, you know?”</p>
<p>“Well… you’re always working hard to achieve goals like sports, studying, and helping others.”</p>
<p>“I see. As expected, you like girls who work hard towards their goals.”</p>
<p>“——As expected?”</p>
<p>“Seira-san is also working hard to win Aiyu.”</p>
<p>“Why bring Seira into this… Anyway, why don’t you aim for Aiyu too, Tomori?”</p>
<p>“…It’s not really my thing. I’m not good at competing with friends or anything like that.”</p>
<p>“I see. That’s a shame. I would have liked to see Tomori working hard toward a new goal, though.</p>
<p>“Ehehe, I’m glad you have expectations for me. Gyu~♪”</p>
<p>” … “</p>
<p>“Gyu~, Gyu~, Gyu♪ Hey, not just me, but I want K-kun to Gyu with me too.”</p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Don’t regret it, okay?”</p>
<p>(TN: “gyu” is a Japanese onomatopoeic expression that represents a squeezing or hugging sound. )</p>

<p>Round ④, Poolside with shaved ice.</p>

<p>“You were so embarrassed, weren’t you?! Doing Gyu~ for so long! Why don’t you disinfect that discolored brain with chlorine!?”</p>
<p>“Minus 1 point.”</p>
<p>“And on top of that, you kept whispering ‘Azuazu’ in my ear over and over… I finally understood today! You’re not K-kun, you’re S-kun! And by S, I mean Sadistic!”</p>
<p>“Minus 2 points.”</p>
<p>“You’re so cold and calculating, it’s definitely S, right?”</p>
<p>“Minus 3 points. At this rate, the game is a landslide victory for me.”</p>
<p>“Ugh… you’re annoying.”</p>
<p>“!? Don’t suddenly shove shaved ice into my mouth.”</p>
<p>“Ehh, even though I was sharing my Blue Hawaii with you. What’s wrong? Your face is a bit red. Are you embarrassed about the indirect kiss—”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>“Whoa!? Hey! Putting shaved ice into my mouth—”</p>
<p>“I was just sharing my lemon. Here, take another bite… Ahh.”</p>
<p>“It’s cold… Wait, did you do it on purpose, dropping it on my chest?”</p>
<p>“Sorry. I wasn’t aiming for that—”</p>
<p>“Hey, can you wipe the ice?”</p>
<p>” … “</p>
<p>“It was K-kun who dropped it, right? So… there, see? Just pick it up.”</p>
<p>“…Is this your revenge for teasing me? Your silly thinking needs to cool down in the pool.”</p>
<p>“Hehe. K-kun, minus 1 point~… By the way, is something wrong?”</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/T30.png  " alt="" />

<p>“——No, it’s just that girl over there with the brown dyed hair and sunglasses. I feel like she’s been staring at us all the time.”</p>
<p>“Minus 10,000 points.”</p>
<p>“Huh? I didn’t say anything toxic. And why so many minus points?”</p>
<p>“…Idiot. You talk about other girls when you’re with me. Minus points as a guy.”</p>
<p>“Don’t go that far.”</p>
<p>“If you give me a present as an apology, I’ll forgive you.”</p>
<p>“What kind of present?”</p>
<p>“Well… Oh, there was a game center in the amusement park area, right? If you could get me a stuffed toy from there, I’d be really happy.”</p>
<p>“Are you okay with that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! If I get it, maybe I’ll give it a cute name and cherish it like it was you?”</p>
<p>“…Hey, you’re trying to make me say something toxic again. What you said just now is way too embarrassing——”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll hang it on the ceiling with a rope and jab body upper straight!”</p>
<p>“Don’t treat it as a sandbag! “</p>
<p>“Ahaha, I’m joking. A gift from K-kun is something I’ll treasure for the rest of my life.”</p>

<p>I completely forgot about the network outage.</p>
<p>I can’t tell anymore how much of it was her true feelings that she couldn’t write on her secret account or it was her teasing me to make me say something toxic.</p>
<p>We swam, played, ran around, laughed together, exchanged words, enjoyed the summer to the fullest, and shared enjoyable time.</p>
<p>With Azusa Tomori, my one and only schoolmate.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of that, I recalled the day when I came here to play just once in the past.</p>

<p>『Let’s swim together, Kei! If you beat me, I’ll treat you to shaved ice!』</p>
<p>『Everyone, don’t forget to put on sunscreen, okay?』</p>
<p>『Geez, why the hell are we here at the pool with you guys?』</p>
<p>『Isn’t it fine? It’s perfect for a change of pace. Kazarina achieved quite a lot in the previous incident. Right, Kei?』</p>
<p>『Yeah. Let’s have fun together today as a celebration.』</p>

<p>It was just two years ago, but it feels so distant now.</p>
<p>A summer as scorching as today.</p>
<p>We came here as the five who formed Kazalina.</p>
<p>I thought I would never have such a fun time with friends again, but——</p>

<p>“It’s my first time having this much fun. I’m really glad I came here with Kagisaka-kun!”</p>

<p>We were by the poolside illuminated by the evening sun gradually setting.</p>
<p>Azusa Tomori in her swimsuit had a dazzling smile like a midsummer sunflower.</p>

<p>“——I feel the same, Tomori.”</p>

<p>The ‘no harsh word’ game.</p>
<p>At first, I started playing it to support Tomori, but before I knew it, I enjoyed it so much.</p>
<p>I can clearly recognize it. Ever since becoming Tomori’s partner, I’ve been able to recall how fun everyday life with friends can be.</p>

<p>“Well…”</p>

<p>But, of course, I’d never say such embarrassingly sincere thoughts, even if it’s ‘no harsh word’.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Oh?”</p>

<p>The signal had recovered as I was looking at my phone in the outdoor snack area.</p>
<p>It seems the communication outage has been resolved.</p>

<p>(I wonder if Tomori noticed.)</p>

<p>My partner isn’t here because she found a little girl who seemed to have lost her parents earlier.</p>

<p>“Wait for me at the snack area! I’ll take this child to the lost and found center!”</p>
<p>Then she dashed away.</p>

<p>“She’s a hero even outside the academy.——Hey, don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>I asked the girl with chestnut hair wearing a white bikini at the table next to me.</p>

<p>“!?”</p>

<p>She seemed surprised by the sudden question and placed the straw she was drinking orange juice with on the table.</p>

<p>“…Did you notice it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Why!?”</p>
<p>“You were following Tomori and me for quite a long time. That’s not normal.”</p>
<p>“J-Just because of that…?”</p>
<p>“I might have seemed like a weird guy. But even with the wig and sunglasses, I recognized those earrings.”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>

<p>Perhaps realizing she was completely exposed, the girl with blue earrings took off the wig and sunglasses.</p>

<p>“Even though you’re just Kagisaka, you’re surprisingly sharp.”</p>

<p>While stroking her silver hair that shimmered in the evening sun, Kazami Chifuyu bit her lips in frustration.</p>

<p>“…Don’t you want to ask why I’m here?”</p>
<p>“I won’t press you for an answer.”</p>

<p>I can already guess the reason, anyway.</p>
<p>Chifuyu was the one who handed us the tickets.</p>
<p>She must have been worried if we could have a proper date.</p>

<p>“Well, there was no point in me coming here. You two were getting so lovey-dovey, it made me embarrassed instead.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s…”</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen Azusa’s face so happy.”</p>

<p>A sense of loneliness overshadowed her beautifully distinctive non-Japanese features.</p>
<p>——It’s a misunderstanding. We seemed lovey-dovey because we were playing a game.</p>
<p>I tried to explain, but suddenly,</p>

<p>“Huh, Kimitaka?”</p>

<p>I was unexpectedly called out.</p>
<p>There, standing gracefully in a pitch-black bikini, was Seira.</p>
<p>Beside her,</p>

<p>“Suzuka? And Tsubacchi too?”</p>
<p>“I’m surprised.”</p>
<p>“What a coincidence. You two came to play as well.”</p>

<p>In swimsuits, Homura and Jinguuji.</p>
<p>Also, a well-built student named Sadaoka, who had previously confessed to Seira in the student council room.</p>
<p>Together with Seira, they formed a group of four.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Kimitaka.”</p>

<p>I wondered why they came to hang out with this group, and then,</p>

<p>“Meeting here must be fate. Won’t you play with us?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>Seira, with her flaxen wavy hair gently swayed invited me, and Chifuyu was left speechless.</p>

<p>“…Kagisaka. Do you know the student council president?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“We’ve known each other since we were kids. I guess you could call us childhood friends?”</p>
<p>“…Hmph, I didn’t ask Kaichō?”</p>

<p>Chifuyu said, with a hint of bitterness .</p>
<p>Maybe she thought she was interrupting my date with Tomori.</p>

<p>“Hey, Kazami. Since you’re dealing with Kaichō, use polite language.”</p>
<p>“Noisy. Shut up, Sadaoka..”</p>
<p>“What’s with that attitude?”</p>

<p>Sadaoka confronted Chifuyu.</p>

<p>“Don’t get too cocky.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been wanting to say this for a while, but you’ve changed completely, haven’t you? Since entering high school, your attitude has become quite arrogant.”</p>
<p>“And you, on the other hand, haven’t changed at all. Back in elementary school, you used to pick on me all the time, saying, ‘You’re too close to Tomori!’ “</p>
<p>“Huh…!?”</p>

<p>Blushing with anger, Sadaoka tightly clenched his fist.</p>

<p>“…It’s just like they said. Kazami, who used to cry all the time and only had piano skills as a specialty, now acts tough even when Tomori isn’t around.”</p>
<p>“Wait a second. What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>“Hmph. I mean exactly what I said. Some students were talking about it. Chifuyu Kazami, who acts all high and mighty thanks to being with Tomori, acts like she’s Tomori’s best friend and looks down on others. Becoming a gyaru is part of that—”</p>

<p>—Splash!</p>
<p>The sound of water splashing echoed.</p>
<p>Chifuyu had just spilled the orange juice she had been drinking all over Kimitaka.</p>

<p>“What the hell!? You piece of…!”</p>
<p>“Hey, wait, Sadaoka-kun!”</p>

<p>Angry and covered in juice on his chest, Sadaoka was about to lunge at Chifuyu without heeding Seira’s attempt to stop him.</p>

<p>“!?”</p>

<p>Our eyes locked as I stood in front of Chifuyu to protect her.</p>

<p>“You’re getting in my way!”</p>

<p>He must have been seriously offended by the embarrassment in front of Seira.</p>
<p>Even in a public place, Sadaoka swung his fist mercilessly.</p>

<p>(As I thought, this guy practices karate.)</p>

<p>Judging from the precise targeting of my solar plexus, he’s undoubtedly a black belt and highly skilled.</p>
<p>However—</p>

<p>(If it’s just this level, there shouldn’t be a problem for me to take it.)</p>

<p>While I was analyzing my opponent’s strength, I intentionally took the second strike aimed at my face.</p>
<p>It’s a technique called ‘slips’. (slip punches.)</p>
<p>As the strike hit my face, I turned my head, deflecting the damage.</p>

<p>“Tch! Get out of my way already!”</p>

<p>Seemingly frustrated that I was still standing, Sadaoka raised his voice.</p>

<p>(He still can’t make calm judgments.)</p>

<p>If he were a skilled fighter, he would have noticed the difference in our abilities after having his strike blocked and second strike completely evaded.</p>

<p>(Seems like there’s no option other than using force.)</p>

<p>It would be easy to defeat him.</p>

<p>However, there’s a problem.</p>
<p>If I simply overpower him, it will become evident that I’m not just an ordinary high school student.</p>

<p>Though Sadaoka doesn’t realize it, there are surveillance cameras in this snack area.</p>
<p>If I were to defeat Sadaoka and they reviewed the footage, it could lead to complications.</p>
<p>It might even become a matter of responsibility for Seira, the student council president.</p>

<p>(That leaves me with only one choice.)</p>

<p>Instead of defeating him physically, I’ll break his spirit.</p>
<p>In the three seconds from when Sadaoka readies his fist again until he strikes, I made a decision.</p>

<p>“Come on!”</p>

<p>He shouted angrily and threw a powerful right punch driven by emotions.</p>
<p>At the same time, I dodged it again and countered with a right hook.</p>
<p>However, I didn’t land the hit.</p>

<p>“Ugh!?”</p>

<p>Just before my fist was about to reach his jaw, I stopped it just in time.</p>
<p>Astonished, he stumbled back, losing his balance and falling on his backside.</p>

<p>“Y-You…!?”</p>

<p>Good, he noticed.</p>
<p>If my right fist had landed, he would have been the one knocked down.</p>
<p>Once I confirmed that Sadaoka’s movement had stopped, I acted as if the previous strike had grazed me.</p>

<p>“Kagisaka-san!”</p>
<p>“Are you okay!?”</p>

<p>Jinguuji and Homura rushed over.</p>

<p>“D-Don’t worry. I-I just stumbled a bit…”</p>

<p>I kneeled on the ground, pretending to be out of breath.</p>
<p>With this act, Sadaoka wouldn’t suspect anything.</p>

<p>——Was that a lucky shot?</p>

<p>That’s the misunderstanding I want him to have.</p>
<p>I won’t press the advantage any further.</p>

<p>(Even if I stop it, that previous punch was enough to instill fear.)</p>

<p>His fighting spirit is already broken.</p>
<p>His thoughts should be somewhat more composed now.</p>
<p>Seeing me crouched like this, he must be reminded how risky it can be for a student of Aisu, a prestigious school, to cause trouble in public.</p>

<p>“You!”</p>

<p>However, there was one unexpected thing for me.</p>
<p>It’s not the certain Senpai who almost took the punch; it’s Chifuyu.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>Chifuyu won’t get angry, right?</p>
<p>That’s what I thought, but…</p>

<p>“What are you doing to Kagisaka!?”</p>

<p>Driven by anger, Chifuyu tried to throw the cup of orange juice at Sadaoka, but…</p>

<p>“Stop!”</p>

<p>In an instant, a clear soprano voice echoed.</p>
<p>It was Azusa Tomori who had returned from the lost and found center.</p>
<p>Tomori, in her swimsuit, lowered the cup she had been holding and rushed over to us.</p>

<p>“Seira-san, what happened?”</p>

<p>She asked Seira, who had the calmest expression among us.</p>

<p>“…I’m sorry, Azusa-chan. I should have stopped it, but I was surprised and couldn’t move…”</p>

<p>Seira apologized and explained the situation.</p>
<p>The fact that we had run into each other by chance, the trouble that occurred between Chifuyu and Sadaoka, and as a result, Sadaoka unilaterally hit me, who had shielded Chifuyu.</p>

<p>After briefly glancing at me, who was pretending to be hurt, Tomori seemed to ponder something, and then…</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Sadaoka-kun.”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>

<p>When Tomori apologized sincerely as everyone’s friend, Chifuyu’s face tensed quietly.</p>

<p>“Chifuyu was rude to you.”</p>
<p>“N-No, it’s not…!”</p>

<p>Seemingly taken aback by the sincere apology from ‘Everyone’s friend’, Sadaoka’s face turned anxious.</p>

<p>“No, it’s me who should apologize! I lost control and… and hit Kagisaka…!”</p>
<p>“…Don’t worry. I’m fine.”</p>

<p>While pretending to be in pain, I stood up to settle the situation.</p>

<p>“Seira-san, for now…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, people are starting to gather. It’s not a good idea to draw attention.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. Azusa-chan didn’t do anything wrong.”</p>

<p>With a gentle smile, Seira left, saying ‘See you later.’</p>

<p>“Kagisaka-san, are you really okay?”</p>
<p>“If it hurts, maybe you should go to the infirmary.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. It stung quite a bit, but it’s not bad enough to see a doctor.”</p>

<p>After being visibly relieved by my words, Sadaoka chased after Seira, followed by Jinguuji and Homura.</p>

<p>“…what do you mean.”</p>

<p>And then, after they disappeared from sight, Chifuyu exclaimed,</p>

<p>“Why is Azusa apologizing? That bastard Sadaoka… he hit Kagisaka!”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Kagisaka-kun is fine, right?”</p>

<p>Tomori asked, and I nodded.</p>
<p>I had shown Tomori my true strength once before.</p>
<p>With her sharp mind, the excellent student probably saw through the fact that I purposely took the hit.</p>

<p>“Besides, it’s true that Chifuyu acted rudely.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“It’s a well-known rumor, and Chifuyu must have known that Sadaoka-kun has feelings for Seira. So, being ridiculed in front of her and drenched in juice, it’s not surprising that he lost his composure.”</p>
<p>“What’s that supposed to mean? Are you saying it’s my fault?”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant. I just think you could have handled it more calmly. That way, things wouldn’t have escalated to this point—”</p>
<p>“Don’t give me a lecture!”</p>
<p>“I’m not trying to lecture you! I’m saying it as a friend! Sadaoka-kun is the ace of the karate club, and he even competed in the inter-high! He may be quick to anger, but he’s caring and respected by everyone in the karate club! If you create a grudge with him…”</p>
<p>“You think I might be bullied again?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Because Sadaoka used to be like a little gang leader; in the elementary division, he often teased and bullied me?”</p>
<p>“…It’s not that I’m saying it will definitely lead to bullying. But… I’m worried. If something happens, I’m anxious if I can protect you…”</p>
<p>“Why do I have to be protected by Azusa?”</p>

<p>With her beautiful face flushed with anger, Chifuyu confronted Tomori.</p>

<p>“I’m not the same person as before! I took off my glasses, changed my hairstyle, and even worked hard to change the way I spoke! I don’t need anyone to protect me from bullying like in the past! So why are you concerned about me? Are you my guardian?”</p>
<p>“Calm down… I am…”</p>
<p>“Calm down? Why don’t you calmly think about your actions?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“You’ve been… you’ve always been worried! No matter how much I tried to change myself, Azusa just kept caring about me! Always helping me, but never relying on me even a little…!”</p>

<p>『Azusa has always been amazing.』</p>
<p>『She was the one who solved the problems and issues of the students all by herself! She excelled in both academics and sports, always at the top!』</p>
<p>『For me, Azusa was someone very special.』</p>

<p>Chifuyu’s words from the park echoed in her mind.</p>

<p>‘Maybe I’m not special enough, and that’s why my best friend is leaving me behind?’ That’s what she thought.</p>
<p>That’s why she pushed herself even harder in piano and tried to achieve good results in competitions.</p>
<p>However, things didn’t go well.</p>

<p>(That’s why Chifuyu admired me and tried to change her appearance and way of speaking.)</p>

<p>She wanted to change herself even a little, especially since she couldn’t even play the piano well, the one thing she was good at.</p>
<p>She believed that if she changed, Tomori wouldn’t leave her behind.</p>
<p>She wanted a relationship where they could support each other, not just where she was the one being helped.</p>
<p>She wanted Tomori to rely on her too.</p>
<p>She believed she could support her lonely best friend who never showed tears to anyone.</p>

<p>(But no matter how hard she tried to change herself…)</p>

<p>Chifuyu’s wish did not come true.</p>
<p>Her best friend chose Kimitaka Kagisaka as an equal partner.</p>
<p>Of all people, the troublesome vice president with whom she had a bad relationship.</p>
<p>Surely, when she understood that reality, Kazami Chifuyu…</p>

<p>“Azusa…why? “</p>

<p>With her voice on the verge of tears, Chifuyu desperately squeezed out her words.</p>

<p>“Why did you choose Kagisaka as your partner instead of me? Why won’t you rely on me? Am I the only one who considered you my best friend? Am I such an unreliable presence to you?”</p>
<p>“N-No, that’s not it!”</p>
<p>“No matter how much I change myself, I guess Azusa’s perception of me won’t change. The shy, crybaby, bullied Kazami Chifuyu will always be the same——”</p>

<p>In an instant, Chifuyu’s expression froze.</p>
<p>As if a knife had been thrust into her heart.</p>

<p>“I see… so that’s why you stayed friends with me? Azusa, I said it before. I told you that I admired heroes and I said you had a ‘justice-like aspect.’ It was obvious now that I thought about it. There is something that Heroes need.”</p>
<p>“Something…?”</p>
<p>“Weak people to protect. That’s why you stayed friends with me, right? Because you saw me as someone weaker than yourself and looked down on me.”</p>
<p>“…!?”</p>
<p>“I see… so that’s why you didn’t rely on me…”</p>

<p>Her voice, which was about to break into sobs, became hoarse.</p>
<p>Tears spilled from her blue eyes.</p>
<p>And then, not wanting her weakness, represented by those tears, to be seen, Chifuyu turned her back to Tomori and ran away.</p>

<p>“Chifuyu…!”</p>

<p>Tomori reflexively tried to chase after her best friend.</p>
<p>However, her feet stopped.</p>
<p>Because she was intelligent, Tomori probably realized.</p>

<p>Consoling Chifuyu right now might actually affirm her weakness.</p>
<p>If that happened, it might break the bond she had built with her best friend since childhood.</p>
