<h1>Interlude 2</h1>

<p>His shooting form was beautiful.</p>



<p>The ball released from such a distant range formed a rainbow-like arch, gracefully sinking into the goal. It seemed almost magical.</p>



<p>Of course, I knew it was a result of skill and his hard work. To ordinary eyes, displaying such skill in a school sports festival seemed a bit of a waste.</p>



<p>I selfishly wished to see his shot even in an official match.</p>



<p>But perhaps, by striving so hard, he understood his own capabilities. He chose to protect exceptional talent over his mediocre self.</p>



<p>Sena Kisumi had this peculiar purity.</p>



<p>Always staying in the background like a pale backdrop. He never complained about being in the shadows, and he didn’t act condescendingly even when helping others.</p>



<p>Understanding what the person needed the most, he naturally compensated for their shortcomings. The other person shone even brighter, yet few pay attention to this shadow.</p>



<p>It might be an inconspicuous and undervalued role, but it was a loss he willingly embraced. While ordinary people might not actively seek it, he unconsciously understood its importance.</p>



<p>Subtly, he had supported many people, saved them, and encouraged them. His ability to prioritize others over himself was a commendable strength. His unassuming kindness might not be flashy, but it was truly appreciated.</p>



<p>Because I, too, was one of those he had saved.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to me, the feelings nurtured within my heart had grown immensely. No matter how much I tried to ignore my true feelings, my gaze involuntarily followed his figure.</p>



<p>That alone made me happy.</p>



<p>That alone was enough.</p>



<p>Anything beyond that was scary and undesired.</p>



<p>If I acknowledged these feelings and expressed them, everything might change.</p>



<p>Once again, I realized how I was becoming more and more infatuated with this boy who’s like the air.</p>
