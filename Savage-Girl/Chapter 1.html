<h1>Chapter 1: Unbelievable</h1>


<p>“Huh!?”</p>

<p>July 2nd.</p>
<p>At the private Aisu Academy, in the after-school library, Azusa Tomori, who was studying for the final exams with reference books and notes spread out, raised her voice.</p>

<p>“Hmm? What’s wrong, Azusa?”</p>

<p>After an hour and a half of studying,</p>
<p>Kazami Chifuyu, who was bored out of her mind with a pen on her cherry-red lips, asked.</p>

<p>“Ahaha, just a little something.”</p>

<p>With a light bob cut of chestnut-brown hair swaying, Tomori stared at me with a sharp look as she sat next to me.</p>
<p>Her face, usually as charming as a few-month-old puppy, was clearly dissatisfied.</p>

<p>“Kagisaka-kun, I got a message from Hasebe-san in the class next door saying that she broke up with Takemura-kun. Do you have any idea why?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing serious. I just advised Hasebe yesterday, ‘If you’re so troubled, wouldn’t it be better to break up with Takemura?’ “</p>
<p>“That’s a big enough deal! “</p>
<p>“? I just gave her a little push.”</p>
<p>“You push her off a cliff!”</p>

<p>Our class representative shouted in a slightly subdued soprano voice, maybe because we were in the library.</p>

<p>“What!? Hasebe-san and Takemura-san broke up!?”</p>
<p>“They seemed like a good match.”</p>

<p>Suzuka Jinguuji and Tsubasa Homura, who were studying together, showed somewhat surprised expressions.</p>
<p>The five of us, including me, Kimitaka Kagisaka, make up the members of this main group for the final exam study session.</p>
<p>To say the least, I’m the odd one out.</p>

<p>(Well, that’s only natural.)</p>

<p>The school’s most handsome guy, a daughter of a big corporation, a silver-haired gal, and Azusa Tomori.</p>
<p>The other four are not just class elites but also at the top of the school’s social hierarchy.</p>
<p>Until recently, I was a loner and an introvert with no friends at all. So, why did I end up joining this group of extroverted popularity?</p>

<p>“Answer?”</p>

<p>It’s all thanks to ‘Everyone’s friend’ who sits next to me.</p>
<p>Just about a month ago, I became Tomori’s friend.</p>

<p>And then, I started helping Tomori with her work.</p>
<p>Helping out with various club activities.</p>
<p>I received all the worries and concerns from Tomori’s friends for advice, guidance, and resolving Troubles at school.</p>
<p>As part of that, ‘I’ll teach Chifuyu to study, so can you help me?’ I was called to this library.</p>

<p>“Why did you break them up!? Hasebe-san and Takemura-kun were so close! They were both regulars in the basketball club, as Homura-kun just said, and they were such a perfect couple! Why did this happen!”</p>
<p>“When she came to me for advice, Hasebe should have already made up her mind to some extent.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“If you’re as smart as you claim to be, you should understand. The fact that she broke up with him just because a non-friend like me encouraged her means she was already searching for a reason to end the relationship.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Even though they seemed to get along well, there must have been something only Hasebe and Takemura knew about.”</p>
<p>“That might be true, but you know what…?”</p>

<p>Tomori’s well-proportioned face leaned closer to me.</p>

<p>“Hey, loner-kun. Do you know what everyone has been calling you lately?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea.”</p>
<p>“Professional Relationship Destroyers. Mr. Breakup. Reverse matching app.”</p>
<p>“——That’s amazing.”</p>
<p>“Right? I know you’re a communication zero and an insensitive guy, but I never expected you’d get this much bad publicity——”</p>
<p>“I bet all those nicknames were thought up by you, Tomori.”</p>
<p>“Ha?”</p>
<p>“Because all of these nicknames have a punch to them. The one who came up with these nicknames must be quite twisted.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha. If it were me, I’d give you a real direct punch without any hesitation~. A powerful one with a twist of the wrist.”</p>
<p>“As expected of a sarcasm powerhouse. The export of sarcasm through sarcasm trade shows no signs of stopping.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that a suitable diplomatic policy for someone like you, a developing country, in terms of unkindness?”</p>

<p>In the library, which could be called the ring, light banter and sarcasm clashed.</p>
<p>Tomori’s thin lips continued her verbal assault.</p>

<p>“All the couples who consulted you about love ended up breaking up. It’s five in a row now.”</p>
<p>“Six if you count Hasebe.”</p>
<p>“Can you stop promoting the declining birth rate in this country?”</p>
<p>“In the first place, Tomori is the one that entrusted me with a certain percentage of those consultations?”</p>
<p>“I had no choice since you said you’d help with my work.”</p>
<p>“Regardless, that should make things a little easier for Tomori too.”</p>
<p>“But still, is it right to consistently recommend breaking up in love consultations?”</p>
<p>“I want the people seeking advice to feel some relief. So they won’t suffer anymore.”</p>

<p>“Wow, Kagisaka-san, you’re like a veteran assassin!”</p>
<p>“Rather, more like a shady doctor recommending euthanasia?”</p>
<p>‘That suits the cold-blooded Kagisaka well,’ Chifuyu added with a sharp voice. Chifuyu had always disliked me.</p>

<p>It was because I had avoided any real interaction with Chifuyu for a certain reason…</p>

<p>(Lately, it seems like her attitude has changed a bit.)</p>

<p>Before, even though she disliked me, she said she wanted to be Otaku friends with me.</p>
<p>However, recently, there have been no signs of such feelings.</p>
<p>Ever since Tomori and I became partners, her attitude toward me has been freezing cold.</p>

<p>“Now-now.”</p>

<p>Homura intervened as a mediator.</p>

<p>“Tomori-san, try not to get too worked up. Among the couples that broke up, there are some who have already found new partners, right?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I heard about that too!”</p>
<p>“Right! Azusa introduced new partners to some of them. She’s truly everyone’s friend! Unlike Kagisaka, her after-care is perfect!”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>I was about to say something, but the class representative cut the conversation short with a smile, saying,</p>
<p>‘It’s not that big of a deal. Anyway, sorry for interrupting your study.’</p>

<p>Then, in secret, she tapped on her red smartphone and poured out her feelings on a secret social media account named ‘tomochan.’ 《…K-kun you big idiot》</p>
<p>Yes, in reality, Azusa Tomori, who couldn’t be honest and was always sarcastic, poured out her true feelings on her secret account.</p>

<p>《Even though I’m so worried about you…》</p>
<p>《You’re so dense.》</p>
<p>《I bet you don’t even realize I have a one-sided crush on you.》</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I’m aware of everything.</p>
<p>Thinking that if I said anything, my partner might attempt bungee jumping without a rope from the window due to embarrassment, I decided to discreetly peek at her secret account on my own smartphone.</p>

<p>In reality, when she gets along well with me, her friends get jealous, so she always tries to provoke me with teasing…</p>

<p>(I understand her intentions a little bit.)</p>

<p>In a way, Tomori is trying to give me her concern.</p>

<p>【I don’t know. Maybe I’ll just say it all.】</p>

<p>I faintly gasp.</p>
<p>Maybe expressing her feelings on SNS alone wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>Tomori sends me a message on LINE.</p>

<p>【No, you can’t. Please keep it a secret.】</p>

<p>To avoid arousing suspicion from Homura and others, who have resumed studying, I tap my phone with a poker face and reply.</p>

<p>【I should just confess everything. The truth is, Kagisaka-kun, you’re actually the one carefully observing and choosing new potential partners for those who broke up.】</p>
<p>【But it’s Tomori who directly introduces them to each other.】</p>
<p>【That’s why I dislike it even more. I feel like I’m just getting the good part.】</p>
<p>【It’s a matter of impression. An introverted guy or the ‘Everyone’s friend’. They’ll accept it more easily if you’re the one introducing them.】</p>

<p>I was raised in the prestigious Kagisaka family, which has produced numerous elites in the medical industry.</p>
<p>People put great importance on labels.</p>
<p>For example, in a trial, lawyers sometimes dress the defendant neatly and groom themselves.</p>
<p>By labeling the defendant as ‘They look presentable and decent.’</p>

<p>By affixing such labels, people hope to improve their impression on the jury, hoping they are unconsciously influenced by the impressions, despite their actions.</p>

<p>(Even when we think we are acting rationally, we are often unconsciously pulled by impressions.)</p>

<p>The label of being an unsociable problem child is less likely to move others compared to the school’s hero, who everyone likes.</p>

<p>【I’m not forcibly breaking them up. I try to understand their feelings, consider the situation, and try to make the best decision.】</p>
<p>【But, won’t this make your image even worse?】</p>
<p>【If I play an active role, it will only attract more resentment】</p>

<p>Tomori pouts, seemingly dissatisfied.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>After we became friends, there was a buzz around us.</p>

<p>『That introverted loner is actually doing the vice-class representative’s work…』</p>
<p>『As expected of Tomo-chan! Taming Kagisaka!』</p>
<p>『But why is he helping with tasks other than class representative duties?』</p>
<p>『No way, are they dating or something!?』</p>
<p>『Well, they’re always sarcastic when they see each other… but you never know!』</p>

<p>Azusa Tomori is an idol at Aisu Academy.</p>
<p>She has been spreading kindness to everyone, from introverted girls to extroverted boys expanding her friendships and solving their problems.</p>
<p>Thanks to her, she has a large number of fans who harbor feelings for her, to the extent that she can put them on a 50% off sale.</p>
<p>Moreover, Tomori has rejected all of their confessions.</p>

<p>【I don’t want to stand out too much; otherwise, the Tomori Friends (Tomori furenzu) will gang up on me.】</p>
<p>【Don’t blame my friends.】</p>
<p>【You’re too friendly with everyone, a total flirt.】</p>
<p>【Isn’t it better than being a loner like you with zero friends besides me?】</p>
<p>【Ugh..I have other friends, too】</p>
<p>【An internet otaku friend, right? I’d like to meet them. It’s surprising there’s someone other than me who can be friends with a bondage monster (束縛野郎) like you.】</p>
<p>【…bondage monster?】</p>
<p>【…who’s the one keeping tabs on my schedule all the time? Deciding which club to assist today and whose consultation to handle tomorrow… You’ve got everything planned out in detail.】</p>
<p>【You should be grateful instead.】</p>
<p>(TN: 束縛野郎, Slang, possessive guy)</p>

<p>Since becoming partners in trouble-shooting activities from June, I’ve come to realize that Azusa Tomori’s life is as hard as that of an overworked employee at a black company.</p>
<p>Not only does she provide advice, but she also serves as an assistant for various clubs, ranging from cultural to sports clubs, and everyone relies on her.</p>
<p>That’s because Azusa Tomori is not just a mood maker but a mood upper.</p>
<p>Watching her as an assistant, it’s evident that just having Tomori around changes the atmosphere, and the morale of those around her get boosted.</p>

<p>(To the point that even during practice matches against other powerhouse schools, the team’s strength gets enhanced, and they achieve victories.)</p>

<p>A natural leadership quality, a personality that everyone envies for being bright and flawless, and her overflowing charm is probably also the reason why…</p>

<p>【You’re definitely working too hard. If I hadn’t been in charge, you’d surely die from overwork.】</p>
<p>【No way? Are you saying that because you want to control me?】</p>
<p>【I can say the same thing right back at you. You’re controlling my eating habits.】</p>
<p>【How was today’s roast beef sandwich?】</p>
<p>【Uhh?… It was actually delicious.】</p>
<p>【Oh my, you’re unusually honest, loner-kun?】</p>
<p>【You’re so mean, Mrs. Talkative B*tch. If I tried to hide it, you’d probably smirk and say, ‘Then why do you always finish everything?’】</p>
<p>【Correct~ ♪】</p>

<p>Tomori, the chef next to me, let out a faint smile.</p>
<p>Yes, in exchange for me managing her schedule, Tomori set a condition.</p>
<p>Three days a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), I have to eat the bento she made for lunch.</p>
<p>Of course, we secretly handle the exchange of the bento to make sure it doesn’t get noticed by the Tomori Friends.</p>

<p>【Why is that Bento a condition?】</p>
<p>【Your eating habits are disastrous. There have been days when your lunch consisted only of vegetable juice and energy bars.】</p>
<p>【I want to finish eating quickly during lunch break so I can study.】</p>
<p>【If you collapse from malnutrition, it’ll cause trouble for me too. Besides, it’s normal for friends to make lunch for each other as I do.】</p>

<p>Here we go again.</p>
<p>——It’s normal for friends to do this.</p>

<p>That had been Azusa Tomori’s favorite phrase for the past month.</p>

<p>《Ahhhh, it’s normal for friends to do this! What a great phrase!》</p>
<p>《Isn’t tomochan just too much of a genius!!??》</p>
<p>《With this phrase as my shield, I can naturally become good friends with Kagisaka-kun!》</p>

<p>——Rather than a shield, I can’t help but feel like tomochan is wielding a spear and going all out.</p>
<p>I was secretly laughing at tomochan inner thoughts on her secret account.</p>

<p>She makes bento three times a week, invites me to Hoshimiya Coffee on weekends to study together, and even chats on LINE for class committee meetings until late at night.</p>

<p>(Huh, I also feel like I’m getting too involved.)</p>

<p>But my stomach, which had never known homemade food, has completely fallen for Tomori’s lunches.</p>
<p>When studying with my rival, who ranks second in grades, I can concentrate better than usual. And even though we mix in the usual poison-tongued remarks and teasing, our casual conversations aren’t so bad.</p>

<p>(——No, don’t be swayed.)</p>

<p>Tomori’s goal is to become the kind of person who gets confessed to by me.</p>
<p>On the other hand, my rule is not to have any romantic relationships during high school.</p>
<p>I want to focus on my studies now to become independent and stand on my own feet after leaving my family’s home.</p>

<p>(Besides——)</p>

<p>Although she’s usually a tease, Azusa Tomori is my benefactor and a very nice girl.</p>
<p>A person like me is not suitable to be loved by ‘Everyone’s friend.’</p>

<p>《Thus, today’s operation begins.》</p>
<p>《We don’t have much time until the event.》</p>
<p>《I’ll take this opportunity to get closer to K-kun!》</p>

<p>The event.</p>
<p>It’s probably right after the tests… that’s what I thought in an instant.</p>

<p>Then I felt a soft touch on my left hand.</p>
<p>Under the desk, Tomori secretly holds my hand while making sure no one notices.</p>

<p>【What are you doing?】</p>

<p>Feeling the warmth of her fingers, I use my right hand to send a message on my phone.</p>
<p>At the same time, Tomori, who is ambidextrous, taps on her phone with her left hand skillfully.</p>

<p>【The air conditioning in the library is strong today, right? My fingertips are getting cold.】</p>
<p>【Don’t warm them up with my hand.】 (Blue text in image)</p>
<p>【It’s normal for friends to hold hands, don’t you know that? Honestly, loner-kun, you lack common sense.】</p>

<p>The usual salty response.</p>
<p>I glanced at Tomori, who was coolly playing with her phone.</p>
<p>For someone like her, who is outgoing and has many friends, holding hands might not be a big deal.</p>

<p>《Aaaah!》</p>
<p>《Fwaaaaaaaa! 》</p>
<p>《Omg! My heart is beating so loudly! My feelings for K-kun are causing a traffic jam in my heart! If he finds out, it’s all K-kyun’s fault!》</p>

<p>I’m really sorry, but I know everything…</p>
<p>Are you a lost dog who was emotionally reunited with her owner?</p>
<p>《Uuu, my heart is about to explode.》 (Right text in image.)</p>
<p>《K-kun must be feeling nervous, too, trying not to let anyone notice.》</p>
<p>《If only he could mistake that nervousness for excitement!》</p>

<p>I see, the suspension bridge effect. (misattribution of arousal.)</p>
<p>People placed in a crisis situation may develop romantic feelings for each other.</p>
<p>They mistake the tension they feel on the suspension bridge for emotions directed at the other person.</p>

<p>(I see. That’s why she chose to secretly hold hands in a crowded library.)</p>

<p>Truly the perfect, honor student-like strategy.</p>
<p>But, I’m sorry, Class President.</p>
<p>I don’t intend to go along with your plans any further.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>I’m sorry, Class President.</p>
<p>I don’t intend to go along with your plans any further.</p>

<p>【Did you do this with other guys too?】</p>
<p>【Huhu, what do you think?】</p>

<p>A seemingly composed response.</p>
<p>Knowing Tomori, she’s probably expecting me to be jealous or something.</p>

<p>【It wouldn’t be surprising if you did. You seem to be used to this, Tomori】</p>
<p>【Huh?】</p>
<p>【I’ll lend you a hand as you requested. But in return, please don’t send me any more messages for a while. I want to concentrate on researching with my phone】</p>

<p>A curt reply from me.</p>
<p>Just five seconds later, her tweet updates at an incredible speed.</p>

<p>《Huh? What? That reaction?》</p>
<p>《Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, it’s not like that!》</p>
<p>《I only like K-kun! I’m not some kind of flirtatious girl who touches anyone!》</p>

<p>Alright, just as I expected.</p>
<p>If she lets go now, that would be a relief.</p>
<p>That way, I won’t have to hold her hand again. To be honest… I’m struggling to maintain a calm expression.</p>

<p>“!”</p>

<p>In an instant, my breath stopped.</p>
<p>As I discreetly peeked at Tomori’s profile, her large eyes were slightly moist.</p>

<p>《…I’m so useless.》</p>
<p>《Why do things always go wrong? I can’t be straightforward and end up being rude…》</p>
<p>《I might have been disliked as a frivolous girl by K-kun. If that’s the case, I may never be able to hold hands like this again…》</p>

<p>Her murmurs matched the weight of her expression, and tears seemed ready to spill from her eyes.</p>

<p>(This love-fool brain…)</p>

<p>Sigh, always getting depressed on your own…</p>
<p>Despite sighing, my heart is filled with immense guilt.</p>
<p>I didn’t send that line to make her look like this…</p>

<p>(…what a perfect honor student.)</p>

<p>I deeply regret my earlier thoughts.</p>
<p>Everyone at the academy relies on Azusa Tomori like she’s a hero fighting a giant monster.</p>

<p>However, I’m the only one who knows the truth.</p>
<p>The real Azusa Tomori is unbelievably clumsy when it comes to her love life.</p>
<p>She becomes awkward and falls into despair when trying to get closer to someone she likes.</p>
<p>She even vents her worries on social media, unable to share them with anyone. That’s the kind of ordinary girl she is.</p>

<p>“Hyaa!”</p>

<p>A small cry echoed from Tomori.</p>

<p>“Hm? Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“N-nothing at all.”</p>

<p>She replied in a somewhat hesitant voice to Chifuyu.</p>

<p>【What are you doing!?】</p>

<p>Tomori’s gaze kept shifting between my smartphone and my left hand.</p>
<p>The reason was that I changed the way we were holding hands.</p>
<p>We held our palms together and intertwined our fingers, sharing our body heat.</p>
<p>The so-called lovers’ hand-holding.</p>

<p>【I just wanted to confirm something. Tomori… I guess you haven’t held hands with a guy?】</p>
<p>【Huh?! Wrong!】</p>
<p>【Don’t lie. You’re getting all flustered just because we held hands like this.】</p>

<p>“Ugh…”</p>

<p>A voice so faint that only I could hear it.</p>
<p>Her skin, as white as freshly fallen snow, suddenly turned crimson.</p>
<p>Tomori tightly bit her lip and tried to endure the embarrassment while operating her smartphone.</p>

<p>【It’s not like I’m getting flustered or anything.】</p>
<p>【Well then, is it fine if we stay like this for a while?】</p>
<p>【Of course. But you better not get all flustered by yourself.】</p>
<p>【It’s a contest of endurance.】</p>
<p>【I’ll win. It’s a prelude to the upcoming final battle.】</p>
<p>【Are you trying to beat me even in tests? Unfortunately, I won’t give up the top spot easily.】</p>

<p>In the background, I could hear the sound of Chifuyu and others studying, the flipping of pages from a different table, the humming of the air conditioning unit on the ceiling, and the voices of the sports teams outside the window.</p>
<p>It was a tranquil scene in the library after school in July.</p>
<p>Amidst the silence, I secretly hold the small right hand of a girl in summer school uniform.</p>

<p>“Uu…”</p>

<p>With an almost accusing look, Tomori squeezed my left hand in response.</p>

<p>【How is it? Can you handle this?】</p>
<p>【Of course. Your face is as red as a ripe apple.】</p>
<p>【Yours is even redder.】</p>
<p>【That’s just because of the evening sun.】</p>

<p>From Tomori’s angle, she must have been able to see my face tinted by the setting sun.</p>
<p>This way, I had an excuse for my blushing cheeks.</p>

<p>(Well, it’s just a little embarrassing, nothing serious.)</p>

<p>Fortunately, I could stay composed and analyze the situation calmly.</p>
<p>Thanks to holding hands like lovers, I managed to stop Tomori’s tears from spilling over.</p>
<p>I don’t need to check her secret account to know. Unlike me, Tomori must be feeling ecstatic on the inside as always.</p>

<p>《…Unfair.》</p>

<p>However…</p>
<p>What appeared on the secret account was completely unexpected.</p>

<p>《Suddenly acting like a couple.》</p>
<p>《If you keep doing these things…》</p>
<p>《I might start thinking you like me.》</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>Her surprisingly candid tweets hit me deep in my heart.</p>

<p>——I should stop checking her tweets for today.</p>
<p>I made a quick decision and focused on my problem set.</p>

<p>Tomori also put her phone aside and started reading her reference book, still holding hands like lovers.</p>

<p>(—Sigh, seriously…)</p>

<p>Azusa Tomori is a good person, my only friend at school, and an important partner.</p>
<p>But I don’t have any romantic feelings for her whatsoever.</p>
<p>So, this is just impossible.</p>

<p>As we tightly held hands under the desk, I faintly felt Tomori’s pulse.</p>
<p>It raced like a rapid melody.</p>

<p>(…Don’t misunderstand.)</p>

<p>What I’m feeling right now is simply Azusa Tomori’s heartbeat.</p>
<p>Not Kimitaka Kagisaka’s.</p>

<p>Yeah, there’s no way I’m losing my cool.</p>
<p>My heart is pounding because I’m holding hands with someone I like…?</p>
<p>Impossible.</p>
